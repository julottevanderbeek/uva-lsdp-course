This is a simple story...
but not an easy one to tell.
Like a fable, there is sorrow...
and, like a fable,
it is full of wonder and happiness.
I sing what I see. Nothing gets by me.
"Here I am," said I to chaos.
"I am your slave!"
And he: "Good."
"For what?" said I.
Free in the end, I am!
What good is a caress when bliss...
this man came to possess?
Here I am, ready.
The trains are gone,
the brakes are gone.
And I can resist no more.
Go, sweet Bacchus, take me.
The brakes are gone!
The brakes are gone!
I heard you.
- No, they're really gone!
- Hit the brakes!
Weren't you reciting a poem?
It doesn't work!
Brake!
We're going to die!
The woods!
Brake!
The king is coming!
There he is!
It's full of people down there.
Straight.
We have no brakes!
We have no brakes! Move!
Go for a walk.
Otherwise,
we'll get there tomorrow.
I found the screw.
Now what do you need?
Nothing.
I need ten minutes alone.
All right,
I'll leave you alone.
Do you want the screw
from before?
No, I want to be alone.
Do I toss out the screw
if I find it?
I need ten minutes alone.
I'm washing my hands.
Pretty girl! How's it going?
What are you doing?
Did your mom put this stuff here?
No, the landlady did.
Is it a market? It's beautiful.
How much is it?
How old are you?
- What's your name?
- Eleonora.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Prince Guido.
- Prince?
- I'm a prince, I am.
All this is mine.
Here starts the prince's principate.
I'll call this place Addis Ababa.
I'll change it all.
Out go the cows, in come the camels.
Camels?
Even a few hippopotamus.
I must go.
I'm meeting with the princess.
- When?
- Now!
Good morning, Princess!
How frightening.
I almost killed myself. Did I hurt you?
I've never been better.
Do you always leave
the house like this?
I wanted to burn that wasps nest,
but I got stung.
A wasp stung you? There?
Allow me.
Hold still, Princess.
A wasp's poison is very dangerous.
You have to get it out.
- Lie down. It'll take a while.
- No, thank you.
- Did you get stung anywhere else?
- No, thank you.
What a place here!
It's beautiful!
Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky.
I'm moing here!
It's all his! He wants to fill it
with camels! He's a prince!
Exactly.
Prince Guido at your serice, Princess.
I'm coming!
Goodbye, then.
- How can I thank you?
- There's no need.
If you really want
to thank me...
I'll take some eggs to make
a nice omelette for my squire.
Take whatever you want.
It's all yours.
Thank you!
I'll take two... six.
All right? I'll make a nice omelette.
Goodbye, Eleonora!
My regards, Princess.
Farewell.
Here I am, Nuolari!
Tonight's special: omelette!
All camels here!
- Where is this house?
- Turn left. We're almost there.
Is your uncle sleeping with us?
He's lied in the hotel for 30 years.
He's the head maitre.
He's lending us the house.
He uses it for storage.
There. We're here.
That's Robin Hood,
my uncle's horse.
Here's my uncle's buggy
and my uncle's house.
And inside is my uncle.
Hello, dear uncle! Here we are!
Hurry, it's late.
Here we are.
The car broke down!
Uncle!
- Barbarians.
- Who were they?
- Barbarians.
- Why didn't you cry for help?
Silence is
the most powerful cry.
Is he your poet friend?
My name is Ferruccio.
I'm also an upholsterer.
Here you are. It's an old storehouse
full of odds and ends.
An old passion...
an odd and end in itself!
What's all this stuff for?
You can stay as long as you want.
It's not easy to be a waiter.
That's the bed.
Legend has it Garibaldi slept there.
Nothing is more necessary
than the unnecessary.
Barbarians.
The town hall is on Via Sestani,
to the right after the colonnade.
The bathroom, equipped
with the inention of Mr Bidet.
There are a few books here,
among which The Life of Petrarch.
The kitchen is in there. This is
aelocipede, commonly called a bike.
I have to get back to the hotel.
There's only one key. Don't lose it.
It's so good to see you.
I'm coming, Robin Hood!
What an uncle!
Look at this!
Didn't I tell you? We're in a city.
You can do whatever you want.
If you want to do something,
you do it.
You want to let yourself go?
You want to yell? Yell!
Stop it!
What are you, crazy?
You can't act
like you do in the country.
You've been yelling like a madman.
You can't yell!
Mary! The key!
See? You can't yell.
Understand? If you stopped thinking
so much about poetry...
you'd make your father happier
and you'd make more money than him.
That's right, Oreste.
That's what I tell him too.
You have to settle down!
What a nice hat.
How does it look?
- Nice. How does it look?
- Nice, but it's mine.
When do I start working?
You're already late.
Right away!
Get that armchair
and take it to the workshop.
- That one?
- That one. And be careful!
Good. I'm going to the town hall.
Goodbye.
Goodbye,
and behave yourselves...
because these are hard times.
Hard, hard times!
They're hard times?
Why, what are your
politicaliews?
Benito! Adolph!
Be good!
What did you say?
I said, how are things going?
Goodbye, then.
Careful!
You'll break the legs!
Goodbye!
He pulled it off.
He took my hat. I'll find him though.
Benito,
you're going to get a slap!
I need to do the whole bureaucratic
procedure to open a bookstore.
- Does it take a long time?
- Years.
Then we'd better
open a file now.
First you apply, and
the department head has to sign it.
I almost scrambled my eggs.
I've had them since yesterday.
I forgot about them.
Thank God they didn't break. Take note.
l, the undersigned,
Guido Orefice...
- Am applying to open...
- He can't sign it now!
What's going on?
I need your signature
to open a bookstore.
- Miss, what's going on?
- Mr Rodolfo, I told him.
- Just one signature.
- No, I can't.
My substitute will be here
in an hour. Ask him.
- All I need is a signature.
- We close at one here!
It's ten to one.
File a complaint.
Boy, is he nasty.
To sign a paper, open a file,
all he had to do was...
Now I have to wait one hour
for his substitute.
I'm filing a complaint.
Write, "l, the undersigned..."
What a wallop!
Are you hurt?
I'll help you.
Come here.
I didn't do it on purpose.
Don't touch me!
You can forget
about your bookshop!
No, the eggs!
You scoundrel!
I'll kill you!
Out of the way!
Good morning, Princess.
I wonder if we'll ever bump
into each other standing up.
Excuse me,
but I've got to run.
Farewell, Princess!
- Chicken.
- That's easy.
It's sered whole,
bottom down on the plate.
"Will you cut it for me?"
"Naturally."
I stick the blade under the wing
then I rip off the drumstick.
I cut the meat along
the bottom of the breastbone.
- Off go the wings, breast and skin.
- Lobster.
Piece of cake, Uncle.
I stick the wing under the leg.
Off goes the leg.
I rip off the lobster, stick the...
Lobster is a crustacean.
Off goes the crust...
of the crustacean.
Off go the crust and antennae.
Who eats the antennae?
Off go the antennae,
off goes the lobster.
There's nothing left.
We're out of lobster,
but the chicken is delicious.
- I don't remember how to do lobster.
- You sere it as is.
There's no need to touch it!
That's too easy.
That's why I didn't remember.
- Continue.
- Behaiour!
Stand by.
Still, like this.
"Waiter?"
"Yes?"
In position.
Stand by behaiour. Waiter!
Why only me?
There must be other waiters, right?
Bowing!
Piece of cake.
You bow down, further.
Like this, at a 45 degree angle,
just like a champagne bottle.
A right angle. 180.
How far do I bow down?
Think of a sunflower.
They bow to the sun.
But if you see some
that are too bowed down...
it means they're dead!
You're sering.
You're not a serant.
Sering is a supreme art.
God is the first serant.
God seres men,
but he's not a serant to men.
- There was no button here.
- It doesn't go there, silly.
I have to take the car back to Pop.
He's counting on it.
You'll take it back
in a month or so.
No, I've got to get it back soon.
You know why?
Why?
Ferruccio? Ferruccio?
- What? What time is it?
- Were you sleeping?
Of course I was.
You fell asleep
while talking to me!
- How did you do that?
- Schopenhauer.
Who?
Schopenhauer says that with willpower,
you can do anything.
"I am what I want to be."
Right now I want to sleep,
so I was saying to myself...
"I'm sleeping, sleeping,"
and I fell asleep.
Amazing.
And it's simple too.
I want to try too.
I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping...
Don't move your hands.
You're not a juggler.
It's a matter of thought.
It's serious, and it takes time.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Amazing, though.
Wake up.
Wake up.
What is it now?
What are you doing?
- It totally works!
- What works?
Schopenhauer.
You know what I just said? "Wake up."
Bam, you woke up.
This theory is incredible.
- How does it work?
- You were yelling in my ear!
That's why I woke up.
- So I should say it quieter.
- Don't say it at all!
It's deep.
You have to think it.
Why are you running?
Slow down!
Hurry up. It's late!
Mary, the key!
Every morning,
she throws the key.
Look!
There's that teacher.
Boy, is she pretty.
I even dreamt about her.
Come with me. I'll introduce you.
- Holy smokes! Stay still!
- What is it?
Don't move!
The one in the car.
He's that jerk the eggs fell on.
He'll kill me if he sees me.
Be good.
- What's he doing?
- He's talking.
- What's he saying?
- How do I know?
- What's he doing?
- He's saying goodbye.
He's got a car just like mine!
There he is!
Don't move.
He'll kill me if he sees me!
Stay still, Ferruccio.
Good morning, Princess!
It's you again.
How do you do this?
This is the princess
who fell from the sky into my arms.
Is he the one who sucked
the stinger out of your thigh?
Yes. We keep meeting like this.
You just suddenly show up.
We could make plans to meet.
- Tonight at 8:00?
- No, it's nicer this way.
Let's go, Dora.
You'll be late.
I hope we meet again
suddenly.
Farewell, Princess!
Did you see her?
She's pretty, huh?
She likes it
when I suddenly appear.
I don't believe it.
"Obscurity."
You're a genius!
"The bigger it is,
the less you see it."
Solution: obscurity.
Marellous.
Did you make that riddle up?
No, but you soled it in fie minutes.
It took me eight days.
Obscurity!
Salmon, salad
and a glass of white wine.
Listen to this one, Guido.
If I may, it's my turn.
My pop told me this
when I was a wee boy.
"The dwares and Snow White
sit down for a bite.
How fast can you guess
what she seres her guests next?"
It sounds refined.
I want to sole it right now.
- Eat first or it'll get cold.
- I don't want to. It's too late.
Salad, salmon, white wine.
It's light.
The dwares...
and Snow White.
- Guido?
- Si?
- Is the kitchen closed?
- Everybody's gone. Why?
A gentleman from Rome is here
from the Ministry. He wants to eat.
The kitchen is closed.
Oh, well, he would have
gien you a good tip.
The kitchen is open.
Come right in.
- Prego.
- Grazie.
Doctor, you're not eating anything?
- "The dwares and Snow White..."
- Buona sera.
I know the kitchen is closed.
Maybe a cold dish.
- It's all delicious. Take your pick.
- Something light.
Well, we've got meat,
a nice heay steak...
lamb, kidneys,
some greasy breaded lier.
- Otherwise, there's fish.
- Fish.
We have...
a nice fatty turbot...
eel stuffed with fatty sausage
and greased with Grand Marnier...
or some lean salmon...
The salmon, thank you.
- Side dish?
- There's a side dish too?
Of course.
We have very, very fried mushrooms...
buttered potatoes in Nancy butter
with a flaky sauce...
Is there a small, light salad?
If not, nothing.
A light salad? What a pity.
The very, very fried mushrooms...
were out of this world.
So, a light salad...
a lean salmon
and a glass of white wine.
Perfect.
As soon as possible.
I'll do my best.
Prego.
"How fast can you guess
what she seres her guests next?"
Right.
- "The dwares and Snow White."
- Good night, Doctor.
Good night, genius.
What did he say? The dwares?
What is he, drunk?
It's a riddle.
"Seven seconds."
"Seven seconds" is the solution.
"The dwares and Snow White."
If there are seen dwares dining...
and she seres seconds,
that means "seven seconds."
Doctor Lessing is a physician,
a very serious person.
But he's obsessed with riddles.
He loses sleep oer them.
Excuse me.
The "Francesco Petrarca" school.
The elementary school? A friend
of mine teaches there. It's beautiful.
It's not far from here. Why?
Good. I can sleep
an extra half hour.
Do you have to go
to that school tomorrow morning?
They're expecting me at 8:30.
Please, children, silence!
A moment of attention.
The inspector from Rome
will be here shortly.
I want to make
a good impression on him.
Listen very quietly
and carefully to what he says.
He'll tell us some very important
things about our beautiful country.
The inspector is here, ma'am.
He's already here?
He's early!
Sit down, Roberto!
All rise!
Good morning, Princess.
Good morning, Mr Inspector.
I'm the principal.
These are some of our teachers.
Good.
Therefore...
How many years have you taught
in this school district?
Sixteen.
Are you up to date
with the ongoing...
school programme approed
by the Ministry this year?
Yes.
Did you read the bulletin
regarding childhood hygiene?
Of course.
What are you doing on Sunday?
No, I mean, Sunday is St Mary's Day.
What are you doing?
I'm going to the theatre.
- To see what?
- Offenbach.
Right,
they're playing Offenbach.
Fine. Well...
Thank you very much, and goodbye.
I just came to...
We know.
As you know, the inspector...
came from Rome to talk to us
about the race manifesto...
signed by the most wellersed
Italian scientists.
He will, and we're very honoured...
demonstrate to us that our race...
is a superior race...
the best of all.
Take your seats.
Go ahead, Inspector.
- Our race...
- Is superior.
Naturally!
Our race is superior.
I've just come from Rome,
right this minute...
to come and tell you in order
that you'll know, children...
that our race
is a superior one.
I was...
chosen, I was,
by racist Italian scientists...
in order to demonstrate...
how superior our race is.
Why did they pick me, children?
Must I tell you?
Where can you find...
someone more handsome than me?
Justly so, there is silence.
I'm an original "superior race"...
pure Aryan.
Children.
Let's start with something that
one says: "What's so big about that?"
The ear. Look at
the perfection of this ear.
Left auricle...
with a pendant
little bell at the end.
Check it out.
Moable cartilage.
Bendable.
Find two ears more beautiful
than these and I'll leave!
But you have to show me them.
They dream about these in France!
Races exist, children.
You bet they do!
But let's continue.
I want to show you something else.
Pay attention.
He said Inspector?
From Rome?
The belly button!
Take a look at this belly button!
What a knot!
But you can't untie it,
not even with your teeth!
Those racist scientists tried it.
Not a chance!
This is an Italian belly button.
It's part of our race!
Check out this style!
Look at these muscles:
ceps, biceps, triceps!
Look at this beauty!
Admire this hip!
Just look at the movement!
Gentlemen!
I must say goodbye now.
I have to go.
I have an appointment.
I'll make my Aryan exit
and bid you farewell.
Farewell!
The belly button!
I'll see you in Venice, Princess.
I can only hear
out of this ear.
Look at me, Princess.
Go on, I'm down here.
Look at me, Princess.
Turn around, Princess.
Turn around, around...
- Can we get a chocolate ice cream?
- Yes, but we'll have to be quick.
Why?
We have to be at the Prefect's at eight.
We were inited to dinner.
- Where?
- At the Prefect's.
Have pity on me, Lord.
Let it not be true.
- Another dinner at the Prefect's?
- Your mother is coming too.
Bingo!
Let's us just go to dinner.
We'll stop by the Prefect's for coffee.
I'm not coming!
All right, I heard you!
I'll tell him we're not going.
It'll just be me and you.
- Good evening, Rodolfo!
- Good evening, Mr Prefect.
I'll see you later at my house.
I'll expect you at 8:00.
We'll be there at 8:00 sharp.
Where is she?
Did you see her?
- She has to be here.
- You're here?
On time tomorrow, got it?
Did you take that stuff
out of the car?
It's silk. Don't ruin it.
Be very careful.
- What an opera.
- Beautiful!
Is that one of your curtains?
No, it must be
one of my colleague's.
He took my hat again!
- Let's go.
- Don't you see how it's raining?
- You go get the car.
- It's right around the corner.
All right, you wait here.
I'll pull up right here and toot.
Gie me the key!
Not the house key!
The car key!
The car key?
Are you crazy?
Keep him busy, you know,
the jerk the eggs fell on.
Keep him busy as long as you can.
I'll see you tonight.
Inside the car there's...
Go slow!
The least you could have done
is come get me with the umbrella.
You're just plain rude.
Look what a mess I am.
Plus, dinner at the Prefect's
gets me so nerous!
I knew it. I've got the hiccups.
I always get them when I'm made
to do something I don't want to.
Don't you know that it takes
so little to make me happy?
A chocolate ice cream is enough!
Even two!
A nice walk together
and then whatever happens happens.
Instead you...
Good morning, Princess!
This is incredible.
You owe me an explanation.
No, you're the one
who owes me an explanation!
I stop under a roof and you fall
from the sky into my arms.
I fall off my bicycle
and end up in your arms.
I do an inspection at school,
and there you are again!
You even turn up in my dreams.
Will you leave me alone?
You've really got a crush on me.
I don't blame you, but...
All right. At this point,
I gie in. You win.
Where shall we go, Princess?
To the sea! Do you like the sea?
Yes, but they're waiting for me
at the theatre. Take me back.
What's happening?
Princess, do you know how
to turn on the windshield wipers?
Step on the brakes!
Have no fear!
Hang on to me!
It's broken!
When did you learn to drie?
- Ten minutes ago.
- I thought it was less than that.
- The top doesn't close.
- The door won't open.
Wait! We're stuck!
We'll get out of here.
I'll take care of it.
The important thing is that
you don't get wet.
Coer yourself with this.
Take it.
We'll get out of here now.
I'll take care of everything.
Here we go.
Step right out, Princess.
There!
Step right out!
There's a huge puddle!
You'll get your feet wet! Wait!
Here!
- Go ahead, Princess.
- Where are we?
We've already been here.
- Me and you? When?
- Don't you remember?
The night it was raining...
and I made you an umbrella
out of a pillow!
It was a beautiful night. I put
the steering wheel on my shoulder...
did a little waltz,
and when I stopped in front of you...
you kissed me.
Princess, your behind
is blowing in the wind.
It depends on the person.
My pop was like that.
He had the ability
to make me do anything.
He understood me.
He knew how to deal with me.
I was like putty in his hand.
I always, always, always said yes.
So, all these treasures
you're hiding...
there is a way to open this treasure
chest and always get you to say yes!
It's easier than you think.
- All you need is the right key.
- And where exactly is it?
Heaven knows.
It's clearing up.
So, you were saying...
the key that always makes you say yes
has to come from heaven.
Yes.
I'll gie it a try.
If the Virgin Mary tosses
it down to me... You never know.
Mary, the key!
Is this it?
Do you really have to go home?
What about the chocolate ice cream?
- Let's get it right now.
- No, not now.
- Then when?
- I don't know.
Are we going to let heaven
decide that too?
No, leave Mary alone.
Don't bother her oer an ice cream!
No, it's way too important.
We can't decide when to have it.
I have to ask her.
Mary, send someone to find out...
how long before
we can have the ice cream!
Seven seconds!
- This is my house.
- I've gone by here a thousand times.
I've always asked myself:
Who lies there?
I wanted to open
my store right out front.
- The bookshop?
- Yes. I'll see you every day.
Goodbye then.
You've been so nice to me.
All I want now is a hot bath.
I forgot to tell you.
Go ahead.
You can't imagine how much
I feel like making loe to you.
But I'll never tell anyone,
especially not you.
They'd have to torture me
to make me say it.
- Say what?
- That I want to make loe to you.
Not just once.
Oer and oer again!
But I'll never tell you that.
I'd have to be crazy to tell you
I'd even make loe to you now...
right here,
for the rest of my life.
You'd better run or you'll get wet.
It's going to rain again.
Princess.
- You're all wet.
- My suit is no big deal.
It's that hat that bothers me.
I need a dry hat,
but where can I find one?
How did it go?
Right, it's easy!
Mary, send someone
to gie my friend a dry hat.
Good night, Princess.
Farewell.
- Excuse me, where's the restroom?
- Straight ahead to the left.
If you don't get up
immediately...
I swear on your father's deathbed
I'll never speak to you again.
For the rest of my life!
I'm going to count
to three now.
If you don't get up,
I'll force you to get up.
Uno, due...
tre.
Good girl.
Do you know
who's getting married?
Didn't I tell you?
That jerk the eggs fell on!
- Who's he marrying?
- I don't know.
But she hasn't even
shown up yet.
Everybody's waiting.
I've looked everywhere for you!
- Your uncle.
- My uncle?
Something's happened.
Come with me!
Outside! The horse!
What's that?
Is that your horse?
What a sight!
What did they write on him?
"Achtung, Jewish horse."
The usual barbarians, andals.
It's sad. What nonsense.
"Jewish horse"!
Don't get upset.
They just did it to...
They didn't do it "to."
They did it "to."
You'll have to get
used to it, Guido.
- They'll start with you too.
- With me?
What could possibly happen to me?
The worst they can do is undress me,
paint me yellow and write...
"Achtung, Jewish waiter."
I didn't even know
this horse was Jewish.
Let's go. I'll clean him up
in the morning.
Take him back to the stall.
Look, there, in front of you!
Dora.
Wait. I'll surprise her.
Dora. Dora.
Come with me. I'd like to
introduce you to Fido Gioanardi.
- Guido!
- Hey!
Doctor Lessing!
Where are you going?
Urgent telegram.
I must go to Berlin immediately.
- What are these flowers?
- They're for your departure.
I'll take just one.
I'll take it to my wife:
Guido's flower.
I truly enjoyed myself with you.
You're the most ingenious...
waiter I've ever come across.
Thank you. You're the customer with
the most culture I've ever sered.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Doctor Lessing.
By the way.
"If you say my name...
I'm not there any more.
Who am I?"
If you say my name,
I'm not there any more.
What is it?
What did he say?
"Silence!"
Beautiful. If you say the word,
it's not there any more. Silence.
I'm not talking about Berlin,
in the outskirts. Imagine that!
Third grade.
Listen to this problem.
I remember it
because it shocked me.
A lunatic costs the state
four marks a day.
A cripple,
four and a half marks.
An epileptic,
three marks and a half.
Considering that the average
is four marks a day...
and there are 300,000 patients,
how much would the state save...
if these indiiduals
were eliminated?
I can't believe this!
That was my exact reaction.
I can't believe
a seven-year-old child...
has to sole
this kind of equation.
It's a difficult calculation.
Proportions, percentages.
They need at least some algebra
to do those equations.
That's high school material for us.
No, all it takes is multiplication.
You said there are 300,000 cripples?
If we killed them all,
we'd save 1,200,000 marks a day.
- It's easy!
- Exactly!
But you're an adult. They make seven-
year-old children do this in Germany!
It's truly another race.
"Good morning, Princess."
- What did you say?
- It's here, on the cake.
Why are you just standing there?
Let's go!
Let's dance.
Just a few words.
You already know it all by now...
and you've known
for several years.
Dora and I were born
on the same street.
We went to school together,
we had the same friends.
Dora is the woman of my life...
and I'm the man in her life,
therefore...
we've decided to get married
within the year.
You're all officially inited
on April the 9th...
to the Basilica of
Santa Maria del Pellegrino.
And then we'll celebrate till dawn
all together, right here...
Just as happy as we are now.
Kiss her! Kiss her!
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.
- Are you all right?
- Fine.
Who put this armchair here?
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.
- I didn't get hurt.
- No, I was talking about...
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- It's going fine.
Go back to your table.
Go on. I can do this.
- Guido.
- Si?
Are you all right?
Fine! Why are you all asking me that?
Is there something wrong?
No, nothing is wrong.
But...
Go to the kitchen.
- Guido!
- Si?
The kitchen.
They moved everything
around tonight.
Look where they put the kitchen.
Peekaboo!
Guess who?
It's me!
What, have you gone soft?
Miss.
We finally meet, Dora.
He never introduced us.
You were scared to, weren't you?
Now you don't need to come
with us to the brothel any more!
I apologize if I've disrupted you.
Happiness and best wishes to all.
You sly old dog!
What a jolly fellow!
Everything is just fine.
I'll pick it all up.
I apologize.
Princess!
You're here too?
Take me away.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
a magnificent surprise
offered by the Grand Hotel.
The Ethiopian cake!
Thank you! Music, maestro!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Right this way, Princess.
But you're...
Quickly, Princess.
But he's...
He's that jerk with the eggs!
Dora!
Ferruccio!
He's got the keys to the house,
darn it all!
Some wire.
I can open it if I find some wire.
I'm a whiz with wire.
My pop taught me.
I used to make toys out of wire
when I was a kid.
I opened it.
Joshua!
Let's go. You're going
to make Mommy late.
I lost my tank.
Don't worry.
We'll find it.
Where did you leave the tank?
- It's on the stairs.
- I'll get it.
Hold the bicycle.
I'll get it.
Here.
Let's go.
- Go, Pop!
- Go slow!
You're late for school! Go!
There's a horse! Two horses!
Stop ringing that bell!
It's driing me mad!
- It's not me, it's Joshua.
- It's not me, it's Pop!
Stop it! Let me off!
Here we are.
See you tonight.
Ciao, Dora. Ciao.
Go fast, Pop!
Uno, due, tre!
Can we buy this for Mommy?
- How much does it cost?
- Fifteen lire.
It's a fake. It's probably
a fake cake, like your tank.
Let's go, Joshua.
"No Jews or dogs...
allowed."
Why aren't Jews or dogs
allowed to go in?
They just don't want
Jews or dogs to go in.
Everybody does what they want to.
There's a hardware store there.
They don't let Spanish people
or horses into his store.
Further ahead, there's a drugstore.
I was with a Chinese friend of mine
yesterday who had a kangaroo.
I said, "May we?", "No, we don't want
any Chinese or kangaroos here."
They don't like them.
What can I tell you?
We let everybody
into our bookshop.
No. From now on,
we'll write it too.
- Is there anybody you don't like?
- Spiders. What about you?
I don't like Visigoths.
Starting tomorrow we'll write...
"No spiders and Visigoths allowed."
I'm sick and tired
of these Visigoths.
Good morning.
Everything's half price.
- Guido Orefice?
- That's me.
- You have to come to the Prefect's.
- Again?
- He already went.
- Let's go.
Why?
- Is that man with you?
- Yes. Let's go.
All right.
- I'm coming too.
- No.
You stay here.
It won't take long, will it?
