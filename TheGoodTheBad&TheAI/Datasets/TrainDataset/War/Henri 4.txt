France, 1 561 .
The most powerful country in Europe
is torn apart by a religious war.
On the one side: the Catholics,
who control the court in Paris.
On the other side: the Protestants,
known as the Huguenots.
In the beginning,
they were a smaII minority.
Soon they were joined
by anyone who was discontented
with the government in Paris.
Catherine de' Medici rules there.
She is trying to hoId on to power
for her three sons.
But in Southern France,
in the smaII Kingdom of Navarre,
an adversary is growing.
One she knows nothing about.
Henry of Navarre
Spread your legs
or we can't see a thing!
I want to have a go!
- Get lost, you aren't one of us.
- I am the Prince.
Exactly!
A prince can do the same as
anyone else and even more.
We'll see.
- Hit him.
- Knock him down!
You're stronger than the Prince.
I can have you put on a spit
and roasted like a pig.
All I need to do is order it.
I guess I went a bit too far there.
But I had to gain their respect.
EvidentIy, it worked.
I can say I had an easy chiIdhood
in our small region, Navarre,
at the foot of the Pyrenees.
At Ieast untiI that fatefuI day
in September, 1 563.
When unfortunateIy,
everything changed.
That was the devil.
- Henry, where are you, my Prince?
- Here.
I am over here, Beauvois.
You must return to the castle.
We have an important visitor.
What are you doing
with these peasants?
Now you need a bath!
- Peasant girls have pretty legs.
- You take after your father.
- He was a hero!
- A hero with the ladies.
I will be too!
God forbid!
That's nothing to be proud of.
- And why not?
- You are too young for that.
I'm freezing, Beauvois.
Mother!
What a brave countenance.
He is the one.
He is still but a child.
Yet he has more power
than any other living person.
Protect your son.
He has the mark of a king.
Of the King of France.
I thank you, Master Nostradamus.
Where is Paris?
Fine, I'll show you.
This is Paris.
And we are here.
This little territory is Navarre.
Your kingdom.
- And all of this is France?
- Yes, that's France.
- They're bringing in the harvest.
- You're not a peasant, Prince.
You are to be the King of France
if your mother has her way.
I don't want to go to Paris.
I want to stay here, with you.
My boy. You shall have no choice.
Run along.
Take this sword, my Prince.
It was your father's.
Please bless him, Admiral.
From then on Admiral Coligny,
the great Ieader of the Huguenots,
was to be a father to me.
You are our hope
for the throne of France.
You shall champion
the just cause and lead us to triumph.
l was taught that
the Catholics were our worst enemies.
No one couId teII me why.
Not even my teacher, Beauvois.
Lances ready!
I'm scared!
We are all scared, my Prince.
Mother!
Go away, get lost!
Go to hell!
You are very brave, my Prince.
What are you doing?
I'm washing my pants.
Your first battle?
I filled my pants
in my first battle too.
No one is born a hero.
Here, take these.
Their owner won't need them.
He did more than sprain his neck.
Agrippa, I've been looking for you.
We wanted to see the Admiral.
Who is that?
Someone with battle-browned britches.
The Prince of Navarre.
I am delighted to meet you, Prince.
- Who are you?
- I am the Prince of Navarre.
Forgive me, Prince. I didn't know.
And who are you?
Two poor poets whose verses
serve no one in such times.
He is Agrippa d'Aubign√©
and I'm Guillaume du Bartas.
You, a poet? That's news to me!
And you, a clothes thief.
That's nothing new.
He's right!
Ideal company for a prince.
I want to go home, Beauvois.
This tent is your home, my Prince.
For many years thereafter,
this mean tent wouId be my home.
War and death wouId be my escorts.
And hatred for everything CathoIic.
This is the Catholics' doing.
I want to eat you up.
My Prince, Prince Henry!
Your mother, Queen Jeanne, is coming.
She's here.
It reeks of fish in your tent.
And garlic. That's me.
Come to the Admiral's tent.
Word from Paris.
They made an offer.
Because they fear us.
As they should.
Catherine wants peace
with the Huguenots.
The slaughter can end.
We agree.
That's new.
But as a sign of reconciliation,
she expects a sacrifice.
The Queen of France
offers you her daughter Margot
in marriage.
- Never was the throne so close!
- Nor peace.
That's what you always wanted.
I don't even know this Margot.
They say her beauty is beyond compare.
Paris, Louvre Palace.
Margot is a sow!
One does not speak so of one's sister.
- You are the King!
- In the eyes of the world maybe.
In truth...
Leave us.
Mind your words before my maids!
Is it not true?
- You hold the power.
- I speak of Margot.
That bitch slept with Guise!
Lord Almighty!
Does she have to spread
her legs for everyone!
- I hate Guise!
- Me too.
On that we agree.
If there's a threat to you, it's Guise!
He pretends to be
even more Catholic than us.
The people love him.
I'll have him castrated, mother.
- I am the King.
- You are nothing.
Nothing at all, without me.
Let me take care of it.
What is my brother, the King,
saying about me?
- The truth.
- Why did you sleep with Guise?
You know he covets the throne!
How dare you?
With Guise!
You...
How dare you?
- You whore!
- Put her over your knee.
You'll pay for that!
You'll pay.
That's enough.
We shall marry you off.
But certainly not to Guise!
To Henry of Navarre.
You can't be serious?
We've never been more serious.
You've lost your minds.
I want peace in my country.
- This marriage is the price.
- Never!
Why does it matter
which cock pecks you?
He smells of garlic, mother,
and behaves like a peasant.
He is a Huguenot, mother!
Your marriage is a symbol.
- The reconciliation of our faiths.
- Over my dead body!
My son, you made a wise decision.
No farewell kiss?
We shall negotiate skilfully.
Catherine shall not have it all her way.
Remember our maxim:
Conquer or die.
Enough have died.
Dear Catherine,
take care of our mother.
Henry, I'm scared.
The Admiral will protect you.
Go.
What do you think, Beauvois?
There are worse sacrifices than
sharing a bed with a beautiful woman.
You know I love you like a son.
Nothing will make you happier than
the joy of those you bring peace to.
For violence is strong
but kindness is stronger.
I hope you had a good journey.
Paris is far away.
And I am all the more grateful
that you came.
Don't be too hasty.
Dear friend,
we will come to an agreement.
What is religion in the end?
Religion is the substance of my life!
Who knows
how long God shall grant it to us?
It's been a long time
since I've felt this good.
Cheers!
Come here, Fleurette!
My Prince, my Prince.
My Prince!
A messenger has arrived from Paris,
sent by your mother.
You are expected!
I shall return, my beauty,
and finish our dance.
The Huguenots are coming!
Retreat to your houses!
The Huguenots!
The Huguenots are coming!
Make haste, hide!
Come, get inside!
I imagined Paris would be livelier.
So did I.
At arms!
Paris seems deserted, Admiral.
- Where are the people?
- They are afraid of your vengeance.
Vengeance for what?
I greet the King of Navarre.
I am not yet King.
Yes, my King, you are.
There has been a great tragedy.
Your mother is no longer alive.
Is this a vicious game you play?
No, my King.
I refused to give her a farewell kiss.
How did she die?
- She was poisoned.
- That is not true!
An evil rumour! Spread by people who wish
to stop your marriage.
Tell me the truth.
Come to my home.
There I shall tell you.
Henry, the Admiral is lying.
We are surrounded by liars.
Our mother was right, this is hell.
This is hell!
I will be on my guard. I promise!
- Stay calm.
- Yes.
Stay calm.
Your mother was very ill.
She could hardly breathe.
Then her lungs failed her.
Any other charge is nonsense.
And my marriage?
Your marriage was her wish
to the very end.
- She asked me to tell you that.
- What does the King say?
Charles and I are now friends.
- Is he fond of us Huguenots now?
- Not yet.
But I support him against his mother.
She is our only threat.
Give me a kiss, my son.
Kiss me.
You have my sympathy.
From now on,
allow me to be your mother.
If you so wish.
The virtuous Jeanne.
Even our best doctors
were unable to help her.
Her wicked lungs failed her.
So it appears.
Let us think about your future.
This marriage is as vital to me
as it was to your mother.
I want to have peace in my country.
You mean in your son's country.
He is the King, that is true.
Have you seen him yet?
My first visit
is devoted to you, Madame.
My son...
...is peculiar at times.
He speaks foolishly of murder.
Please don't listen to him.
But now, you should see
my beautiful daughter.
I am very curious, indeed.
You are a goddess.
Did you hear, Charlotte?
He is flattering me.
Give me your hand.
Allow me to kiss it.
Take the birds back, Charlotte.
Stand up then.
My little King of Navarre.
I wish to gaze upon your eyes.
I know exactly
what you wish to gaze upon.
- I shall not marry you.
- That is your right.
Really?
I would never force a woman
to act against her wishes.
You haven't the power to do so.
But I can wish for it.
That depends.
I wish to take you in my arms,
to kiss and caress your exquisite neck
and to explore
your ear with my tongue.
- I thought you were a peasant boy.
- Not in love.
I don't want to love you.
- I'll love you all the more.
- You're not allowed to.
Who shall forbid me?
Me.
What have we done?
Already been under my sister's robes?
Everyone knows what's underneath.
D'Anjou, my brother, was the first.
We are a magnificent family.
You couldn't have done better.
Welcome, brother-in-law.
As you can see, I am healthy.
You'll have to wait
awhile for my death.
But I do not wish your death.
Then you are alone in that.
Everyone else wishes for my death.
Even my mother, my brothers.
What do you think of Paris?
It is no place for us.
Be on your guard.
I will, Beauvois.
I will.
I shall not wed that peasant.
You will do as you are told!
Their church looks like a fairground.
Not like the house of God.
You should not enter it. Not even once.
Then we'll get married in front of it.
Henry of Bourbon...
In front of the church!
In this heat!
I'll never forgive you.
...to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
Marguerite de VaIois,
Princess of France,
do you take Henry of Bourbon
to be your lawfully wedded husband?
Then, before God and man,
I now declare you
husband and wife. Amen.
Don't fret, we'll stay down here.
And stand guard.
Close the door.
Are you invisible, my beauty?
Not for a Iover's eyes.
My love could not be greater.
Welcome, brother-in-law.
To your health.
You look as if
she had her way with you.
Let me introduce my brothers.
That is d'Anjou.
He lusts after men.
And the throne.
He is mother's favourite.
Look out for him.
This one's always sick.
The little monster, d'Alen√ßon.
He too aspires to my throne.
Do I care?
I don't give a damn!
- The words of a king.
- Shut up. You bastard!
Calm down, my King.
I will crush him into little bits!
My father...
Stand by me against my enemies.
You must stand by me
against my enemies!
Yes.
Sire.
- You ought to go to bed.
- No.
Not to bed!
Death lurks.
Navarre.
My dear Henry.
Whatever may happen,
I am not at fault.
I am just afraid.
Of all people on this earth,
I live with so much fear.
Guise!
Come. Lend a hand, Navarre.
We must flank the throne.
I know what you mean by that.
Hands off, you bastard!
You've both been
under Margot's robes.
But she left you.
You spawn of the devil!
You, however...
She loves you.
Just as I do.
What a celebration?
- Music!
- There's the devil.
I must speak with you, Majesty.
Henry, Duke of Guise.
And my brother, Mayenne.
Who invited you?
The King did not, I'm afraid.
He must have forgotten.
Wipe your mouth.
The people are full of hatred.
They want blood!
- My blood?
- You fool!
Not yours. You are the King.
They hate the Huguenots,
and want the Admiral's blood.
No, do not touch him!
Never!
Is that your last word?
My very last.
Then I'll have to decide
what I consider correct.
Go.
There is only one way
to save the throne.
Guise must bloody his own hands.
He has long wanted
revenge on Coligny. Let him have it.
The Huguenots will want revenge
and our problem will solve itself.
Your shrewdness, dear mother,
is deadly.
Not for you.
- Does the King know?
- He is beside himself.
Who is behind it?
- Allegedly Guise.
- He lives!
- God be praised, he is alive.
- We must go see him. Quickly!
This is what comes
of their reconciliation.
How do you feel?
Betrayal, my King,
causes me more pain than their bullet.
You're sure it was Guise?
A long story.
He believes...
He believes I am to blame
for his father's death.
Are you?
No.
My father,
if you have something to confess,
then tell me.
Tell me.
It was his father
who wanted to kill me.
I merely pre-empted him.
Guise wants the throne
and the people are on his side.
Go.
Come.
Huguenots live here.
Stop!
- Are you Catholics or Huguenots?
- We're Catholics.
Good. Keep going!
Get up.
Your throne and life are at stake!
The Admiral, is he dead?
- I will avenge him!
- He lives. And you will do nothing.
Guise merely fulfilled my wish.
- You ordered it?
- Desired. I have no power to order.
What luck that he still lives.
What bad luck.
Now you must order his death.
Never! Never!
Then he will destroy us. You and me!
The whole city is arming itself.
The people are crying out for action.
The Admiral must die.
- Give the order!
- I cannot! I cannot! Never!
Come.
We must leave to save our lives.
The King is a pathetic coward.
I'll kill you. I'll kill you all!
All of them.
Huguenots.
Protestants.
All of them!
Burnt! Quartered!
- The Admiral as well?
- Him too, my father.
Away with him!
Cross the street.
Hurry, they'II get away.
Henry, I've been looking for you!
The people are rebelling!
Against us Huguenots?
Your marriage didn't appease them,
quite the opposite. I think...
What?
We were lured to the city.
That's impossible.
Prince, both sides have suffered
so much injustice and death.
Peace cannot be decreed,
not even by the King.
Look at the people.
They want revenge, not reconciliation.
You said that violence is strong
but benevolence is stronger.
And so it is.
But one needs great strength.
Many do not have that.
- Seek safety. I have friends close by.
- No.
I must return to the Louvre.
To the right!
Now!
- Is it done?
- Yes, Lord! I've taken care of him!
I want to see him.
Throw him down!
It's him.
The Catholics!
A trap!
Defend yourselves!
We must find the King!
Only he can stop them!
Sire, open the door!
Open the door!
Close it, close it!
Bolt the door, quickly!
Navarre!
Sire. What did you order?
Me? Nothing! I did nothing!
I am not responsible.
I gave no orders!
You're massacring my Huguenots.
You are massacring my Huguenots.
We had to be quicker than you!
It's true.
I had no choice.
I had no...
I'm bleeding.
As Jesus bled on the Mount of Olives.
This is fear.
I'm dying from all this fear.
Lord, let this cup pass from me...
They're butchering our people, Sire!
And us? We don't lift a finger!
We are saving our lives, that's all.
Why sacrifice ourselves?
For our beliefs, Sire!
You wish to die for that?
- Not me.
- I did not want any of this!
Who did?
She did!
My black-hearted mother!
No. I'm not mad, like they all think.
I'm not mad, Navarre!
They leave me no choice.
Not my mother and not you!
My governess is a Huguenot!
Brother, do not leave me!
I beg you!
Wait.
That's my Beauvois.
- What are you doing with him?
- Throwing him in the Seine
along with the others.
- But he's alive!
- What?
No!
Navarre.
Navarre!
There is someone lying in your bed.
A Huguenot.
A Huguenot!
Sire, spare this man.
I was alone. He entered my room
pursued by monsters.
I had no choice.
Look at him.
I will lie next to him!
I am no better off than him.
Even the birds have stopped singing.
Henry?
Why did you leave me alone?
Our wedding...
What a celebration.
You knew about this?
I knew nothing.
Your mother ordered this massacre.
You are alive, Henry.
Henry.
I love you.
Love died tonight, Margot.
- Our love has been wiped out.
- No.
Not our love.
We cannot become enemies.
We must not.
We must not.
Sit with me, Navarre.
You saint of the Pyrenees.
Be on guard. Here comes death.
We survived.
Let us celebrate
the Resurrection and Ascension.
Music!
My lords and ladies!
I present fear! Captured.
You show us how cruelty conceals itself.
And you show us the opposite.
The Admiral was our enemy.
What happened
afterward was not intended.
You blame the dead
to make your life tolerable.
- Do you want to kill me?
- Perhaps.
Then do it!
I need to get out of here!
You can't leave the Louvre.
That was the condition.
- Condition for what?
- That you stay alive.
So you knew after all?
Not everything.
Nobody could have foreseen that!
The entire city is full of these birds.
I miss my friends.
- They are under my supervision.
- Good.
If it keeps them alive.
Do you sleep peacefully, Madame?
My sleep is good and bad,
befitting my age.
All this killing disgusts me.
The mob too.
Do you expect me to believe you?
Why do you think you are still alive?
Because it was my wish.
- Convert to Catholicism.
- You take me for your fool?
You lack the wit to be a fool.
In your presence,
that is hardly surprising.
What is your answer?
It requires no effort on your part.
It will cost me my friends.
- And my beliefs.
- Foolish prattle.
You are not your mother.
We both believe in the same God.
I thought you were Catholic
with heart and soul.
With heart and soul, I am the Queen.
You sacrificed thousands for that?
It had to be so.
For the sake of millions.
For your sake.
What's the difference?
Good.
I agree to become a Catholic.
But on one condition.
My sister and my companions go free.
- And nothing else?
- Nothing else.
Nothing else.
I am a king of sorrow.
Dear governess. Am I not?
Who's there?
Are the bells ringing again?
No.
Sit.
How many survived?
Not many.
Thirty thousand were killed.
- Thirty thousand!
- In your name.
I will also die, Navarre. I can feel it.
Navarre, were you my friend?
I suppose so.
That makes it easier.
You must know, my brother,
your life was also in danger.
I did not allow it.
I've heard so from everyone.
What do you think, governess?
Does this one outweigh the rest?
You will not be able
to bargain with God.
The fear...
Navarre.
If only I'd been less afraid...
I would have been a good king.
Put up the bars.
Long live King Henry III.
Long live the King!
Long live d'Anjou!
Enough.
Me too.
Come kiss my back,
my little Navarran kingbird.
Lust and pain, the poles of my life.
- I win!
- Not if you'd played fairly.
What is fair, Monsieur Mayenne?
Not the court!
The little kingbird has figured us out.
- You promised me a hunt, Guise.
- My offer stands.
Hunting in the forest?
How do I know I can trust you?
Trust me like I trust you.
There! The stag!
Go! Go! Go!
Navarre is fleeing!
After him! He must not escape!
Sire!
Sire!
Quickly, come here!
- Sire! Come to me!
- They're right behind me!
To the boat! Quickly!
The river! Hurry!
Take cover! Head down!
Did we get him?
- And you?
- Never mind me!
I don't think so. Reload!
Were you waiting long?
For three days, Sire.
Thank you.
It's an honour.
He has escaped?
Yes, alas Madame. On the hunt.
But Henry is my friend.
You have no friends here.
Margot!
- Did you know about this?
- I knew nothing, I swear.
Save your oath!
He was not to escape.
Under no circumstances!
Now it starts all over again.
How I hate war.
Do not give up, Pastor.
Pray!
God will come to you
if you renounce the Pope
and return to the bosom of our Church.
Repeat after me: I swear...
He cannot hear me.
Pastor.
It is not your time to die.
There will be other opportunities.
I will try, my friend.
Come here.
- What's your name again?
- Rosny, your Majesty.
Rosny.
Drink with me, my friend Rosny.
I owe my life to you.
And to the grace of God.
Where would I be with God
but without my friends?
Before everything.
Before time.
Before matter, form and place,
God was one and all,
and all was in God.
lneffable and infinite.
Unchanging, impassive.
AII spirit, aII Iight, immortaI,
invisible,
pure, wise.
Just and good.
My country is poor.
We must make it bIossom again!
In my kingdom, everyone will be free
to think and believe as they please.
They will have enough to eat
and to drink.
And on Sundays every peasant's wife
will have a chicken in the pot!
Who is it?
Enough with the music.
But we just started.
Your brother, d'Alen√ßon,
is dead.
Poor beast.
He was so insignificant.
We Valois die before our time.
Even these dogs might outlive me.
I am the last of the House of Valois.
You must finally sire a son.
It is not in my power.
I tried my best with a woman.
Who disgusted me!
But to no avail.
I too cannot bear children.
Any simple peasant girl can
but I cannot.
Is this my fault?
Bring back your husband.
Brilliant, Mother.
He has a claim to the throne, after me.
Only with him can we hold power.
And beat Guise once and for all.
Such audacity!
How can you treat me this way?
I shall complain!
Let go of me!
This is how you greet your wife?
Visitors from Paris
are treated with caution.
- I have a message from your King.
- What is the message?
Not even a kiss?
Not even a little tenderness?
Good.
I come with a request.
Yes?
Must I tell you here?
In the cellar?
Better the cellar than the dungeon.
My... My brother and mother
- want you to come to Paris.
- No.
No? That's all?
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! You Devil!
- Did you hear that, Joyeuse?
- Yes.
I should have sent you.
My sister can't negotiate
with her husband.
What a shame!
Sire,
if you can't win him over,
eliminate him.
Checkmate.
It doesn't count!
Yes, it does!
I won't go to war.
He escaped.
First he leaves me,
then abandons you.
Guise is my worst enemy.
It's him I fear the most.
I still think of Navarre as a friend.
No! Why?
He was never your friend.
Are you blind orjust a coward?
Probably both. I don't know.
It's so confusing.
It's not my fault.
It's the times we live in.
What do you think, Mother?
I think you've been given no choice.
I am as afraid of dying as you are.
Trust me.
But if you look for me,
you will find me
in the thick of the fray.
We are not fighting for glory or honour.
We are being forced to fight.
Over there,
they fight only for power.
We are fighting for our survival!
And for the honour of God!
And for the honour of God.
May you grant us victory, oh Lord!
Fight those, oh Lord,
who would fight us.
Make war with those
who would make war with me.
Take up your shieId and arms.
What are they up to, Marshal Biron?
They're praying.
It won't help them.
We have three times as many men.
The Huguenots are not
to be underestimated.
They're fighting for their faith!
Who rescues the poor
from those who rob them.
You will win, brother, for you fight
for your faith and your freedom!
You are fighting for peace!
You fight for your family!
Forget not, my brothers!
To battle!
- Do you wish to rally the soldiers?
- Should I?
It won't hurt.
Your commitment to the King
will be royally rewarded.
We will destroy the heretics!
Fire the cannons!
Split up!
To battle!
Joyeuse is dead!
Joyeuse is dead!
The battle is lost! Withdraw!
We've lost!
Did we win, Rosny?
What does reason dictate?
The enemy fled.
That can only mean it was a victory.
Despite all the dead.
We counted over a thousand.
Why?
Over there, Sire,
lies someone who loved you.
This is not the time to die, du Bartas.
My brother!
- What are you doing here? Get out!
- What have you done?
You advised me, you stupid cow!
The royal army has been beaten!
Your little knave is dead!
The whole city is against you!
They are calling for Guise
and for your head! As they should!
That would suit you, you whore!
What did you call me,
you pathetic fool?
You're absolutely incapable.
A caricature on the throne
calls me a whore!
Leave the court! Immediately!
I'll show you who's King
by banishing you.
You can't do that.
Oh yes, I can! Away with you!
You are banished!
Don't dare come back!
Sire, your army is vanquished
whilst you cower in bed.
- You call that ruling?
- I owe you no explanation!
Do you hear what they are shouting?
- You're finished!
- No, Guise, you're finished!
Go ahead! Stab him!
Is he really dead?
Yes, he's dead.
We've eliminated him, Mother.
We've eliminated him.
The people are against you.
That's much worse.
What should I do?
My poor darling.
Make peace
with Navarre.
- I'm as hungry as a wolf.
- This is all I have.
Thank you.
It's better than nothing.
Since we're not allowed to plunder...
- We are not robbers.
- Nice words won't fill our bellies.
Roaming around like stray dogs...
What gain has our victory brought us?
Castle Coeuvres isn't far from here.
The owner, d'Estr√©es,
was never a friend to the King.
Stop!
Not one more step!
You hope to kill both of us
with a single arrow?
- We come in peace.
- That's what thieves say, too.
I am the King of Navarre.
Of course you are!
He really is! Our Henry.
- You vanquished the royal army?
- Indeed.
Along with my friend Agrippa
and my army
which is waiting in the woods.
I'm Diane d'Estr√©es.
I wanted to ask your father...
if maybe...
My sister, Gabrielle.
The King of Navarre,
and his friend.
Words fail me, Mademoiselle...
You render me speechless.
A pity!
Then we won't learn
what brings you here.
We came to ask your father
to grant us shelter.
Our father has gone to Paris
to attend the Queen's funeral.
- Madame Catherine is dead.
- She died peacefully, in her bed.
Catherine de' Medici.
She fought all her life
for her sons' power.
- In vain.
- D'Anjou can't hold power without her.
Me, however, I'm sitting in the bath
while two beautiful women bring me water.
- What did he whisper?
- I'll return, my beauty.
- He's in love with you!
- He smells like a goat!
- He's the future King!
- So?
Gabrielle, you're too dumb to be a whore!
You make a good target, Sire.
What should I fear?
D'Anjou requested this meeting.
Not me.
Help! The King is dying!
He stabbed the King!
Henry.
Sire, what a reunion.
You are closer to the throne
than ever.
You must become Catholic.
Henry... Swear it.
The King is dead.
In France, kings don't die!
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!
A Huguenot king? Never!
The King is whoever controls Paris.
That's us. The Catholics!
Whoever won't bow to me may leave.
I won't renounce my faith.
I want to be King of all the French.
Sire, you were my enemy,
as I was yours.
That is in the past.
I won't risk my neck for Mayenne!
You are my King!
Marshal Biron,
with you we will conquer Paris!
The town can't be conquered!
Paris is tougher than I thought.
They won't just open the gates.
The siege is having an effect!
But not the effect I want.
They'll only accept a Catholic king.
Let them starve!
I won't be a king
who lets his people starve.
We withdraw!
- So close to our goal?
- Yet so far from it!
Unless you convert to a Catholic.
As a Huguenot,
I cannot advise you to do so. But...
Paris is worth a Mass, Sire.
Peace and unity are better.
Stubbornness costs too many lives.
Rosny wants tolerance.
And that's what I want as well.
Rosny has no idea!
You're considering treason!
- Who am I betraying?
- Us!
Everyone who fought in your name.
But I'm not doing it for myself!
I'm doing it for France!
I won't abandon my Huguenots!
You already have!
- Sire, you have a visitor.
- I don't want visitors.
Gabrielle!
You're more beautiful than I recall!
Monsieur, tell me what you want.
I want to take you in my arms.
I want to kiss you. I want to...
I want to love you.
What do I get in return?
You want to barter?
Very well.
Very well,
let's barter.
The King's patronage for my family.
But I'm not the King.
You will be.
Then I grant you my patronage.
Henry, what is it you seek?
I desire to be taken into the fold
of the Roman Catholic Church. Amen.
Do you desire it wholeheartedly?
Yes, with all my heart.
Credo in unum Deum,
Patrem omnipotentem
factorem caeli et terrae,
visibilium omnium et invisibilium.
Et in unum Dominum Jesum Christum,
Filium Dei unicum,

Deum de Deo,

Deum verum de Deo vero,

et propter nostram salutem.
Who hired you? Tell me!
Who's behind this?
Who?
The Louvre.
Cold and hostile.
How I hated this place!
You return as King, Majesty.
King of France!
An amazing moment.
Henry IV enters his palace!
It's been so long
since we enjoyed such an evening.
Cannon fire simply forjoy.
Hope to God
our enemies share your opinion.
The Spaniards threaten us with war.
I beg you! No more. Not tonight!
- Sire, Monsieur Zamet, an old friend.
- Sire...
Majesty...
My King...
Which title do I choose?
Stand up, Monsieur Zamet.
Monsieur Zamet is a worldly man.
And a wealthy man!
Keep him in mind.
What do you want from me?
My father!
That belongs to me!
Give it back!
- It's not yours!
- Your Majesty.
What's the matter, Monsieur d'Estr√©es?
He stole my ring!
Lies, your Majesty!
- I bought these!
- Bought?
He stole them!
Calm down. Please listen to me.
All of this was arranged.
I had a wager with Governor d'Estr√©es
that he couldn't pass for a thief.
I've won.
Monsieur d'Estr√©es,
give back their belongings.
As I see it, nothing's been lost.
- Well then?
- Let's have it.
Forgive him.
There won't be a second time.
Henry, make amends with him.
I should? He's indebted to me.
You're the King.
Who could be indebted to you?
I won't often ask you for favours.
And I shall refuse you nothing.
My father would like to be
General of the Artillery.
Does he know
anything about cannons?
He'll learn.
I promised Rosny that post.
Do it for me.
The whole country is like this!
The peasants can't plant their fields
for lack of grain.
Then we'll buy some.
With what money?
I'll invest everything I own.
I finally have the power
to change everything.
France will blossom again!
And I'll forgive your Catholicism.
All these roads are in bad condition.
But trade needs good roads.
We need schools.
The people have to learn
to read and write.
Don't forget my peasants!
That means work for at least ten years.
Out of my way!
That was the Battle of Arques.
And this, the one of Ivry.
As you see, no sleep for me.
At least, not with my wife, Margot.
It's other bums
on which my favours I bestow!
A small contribution.
Your laughter surprises me, Sire.
Why? Do you find me too common?
That, too! But there's something else.
Calais has been invaded
and is under occupation.
Calais first, now Amiens.
May the devil take the Spaniards!
Money, Money!
I don't want to taIk about money!
I suppose you already know.
Amiens has also fallen. I know.
Thanks to Monsieur d'Estr√©es.
There is nothing to stop them.
No army, no river.
They can march straight to Paris.
Another war.
No, Sire.
No war.
You can't fight a war
with empty coffers.
Why are they empty?
You bought grain
for the poor peasants.
We're building roads everywhere.
The beautiful lady, Sire, at your side.
It all costs money.
It's my fault
that we can't pay an army?
That's absurd!
- I know what you say about me!
- Enough!
Calm yourself, Gabrielle, please.
I will find a solution.
I am quite intrigued, indeed.
Where are our cannons,
Monsieur d'Estr√©es?
The artillery refuses to fight.
Refuses?
You didn't order it?
They say they won't fight without pay.
My men are moaning too.
I had to threaten them.
You can no longer count on
the loyalty of your Huguenots.
Rosny is looking for funds,
but he needs time.
If they defeat us today,
all our efforts will have been in vain!
There's Rosny.
Gabrielle?
Open the lock.
Ten sacks of gold, Sire!
- From whom?
- From Monsieur Zamet.
I mortgaged everything
to win this battle.
Just for your victory!
France has prevailed!
We've won.
You are alive.
It was his last battle.
Glory and honour
to a courageous soldier!
And, above all, to a friend.
Long live the King of France!
And his fair Lady!
We owe this victory to you as well.
In gratitude for your assistance
you shall be the Duchess of Beaufort!
You promised me something else, Sire.
Ever since I was
the little King of Navarre,
uncertain of my future,
a long way from France's throne,
I've longed for this great hour.
Now I am strong enough
to declare that you shall be free.
Free in your beliefs...
and free in your thoughts.
That he should permit heresy
is blasphemous!
No one knows what he believes in.
Probably nothing at all.
Nobody will be persecuted
for different beliefs than the majority.
Catholics and Huguenots,
all of you are my people.
I love you equally.
This shall be the law in France
from now on.
Long live the great King!
As great as he may be,
he's merely mortal.
I hear the future King's heart beating.
You will be King.
I promise.
I can't live without you.
I am going to marry you.
Majesty. The Papal Legate from Rome!
We congratulate you on your victory.
You are a great king.
Too great, perhaps...
You're turning
the natural order upside down.
Because I believe
in religious freedom?
This freedom
cannot exist.
I am the King of all the French.
But your power depends
on the Pope's grace. Don't forget.
How could I?
There are people who hate you.
I do not.
I seek your friendship.
However, should something
happen to you...
You came to threaten me?
I came because you asked
the Pope for a divorce.
My marriage to Margot was childless.
I need an heir.
The Duke of Tuscany
has a very beautiful niece.
Marie
de' Medici.
No, thank you.
I am familiar with the House of Medici.
Not Gabrielle d'Estr√©es.
This is the Holy Father's will.
And if I don't obey?
Your Majesty,
the tree that refuses
to bend in the storm...
May I give you counseI?
You've always advised me well.
Before your wedding
spend some time at a monastery
to reflect and to demonstrate
your piety to the Pope.
Who put that idea in your head?
The Papal Legate did.
In a monastery with Catholic monks?
It seems too obvious to be a trap.
I entrust you with my most
valuable possession, my friend.
- Sire, have I ever disappointed you?
- No.
We both wish you a safe journey.
I fear for you.
I beg you,
please don't leave me alone.
Don't be afraid, my beautiful angel.
I will be well guarded at all times.
Till my return,
my Queen!
Agrippa!
Where were you?
There was a man in my room!
Sire, it's time for Mass.
My Lady is expected.
The password is Black Chicken.
Thank you Monsieur Zamet.
You save me a second time.
For the future Queen, I...
No one can learn of this! No one!
Madame, I give you my word.
Your condition requires that...
May I stay until the King returns?
Yes, Madame. My bedroom is yours.
Let me just check
that everything is in order.
Good morning, Monsieur Zamet.
You have a royal bed.
As long as the ladies slept well.
Please sit.
Why all this caution?
Do you expect enemies in your home?
You never know, Madame.
That would be a shame.
I'd only like an orange.
An orange, quick!
Your home is very pleasant.
Much more light than in the palace.
God grant that it remains so.
Now you're exaggerating.
That's enough. I'll do it.
- It's bitter.
- No! Oh God, why me!
Go! Everyone leave!
Out of my sight!
Monsieur Zamet! Calm down!
She is pregnant
and thus very sensitive.
No need to be so upset!
Catherine!
Gabrielle!
Somebody do something!
Where is she?
We couldn't prevent it, Sire.
Tell me where she is!
A tragedy, Sire...
Sire, your beloved
is no longer alive!
No.
You were supposed to protect her!
Why didn't you?
Why?
Sire!
Agrippa is not to blame!
Please listen to me!
Gabrielle died because of the child.
What is this, Catherine?
It's just a doll, Henry.
We wanted to spare you
the sight of her.
Majesty.
The doctor who stood
by your beloved in her final hour, is here.
Is it true that you are in contact
with the Medici?
Who told you that?
Have you no shame?
This is about France! He's the King!
You have no heart and no conscience.
Sire, please open the door!
Listen to him. I beg you.
- I swear...
- That she wasn't poisoned?
Yes, Sire.
- Upon my oath.
- Keep your oath.
I left her alone.
You didn't kill her.
That's all we know.
We opened her body.
Her own body poisoned her.
The child was in the abdomen,
- nearly rotten...
- Spare him the details.
I loved her, Rosny!
I loved her as my one true love.
I loved her body
as much as her whole being.
You say the blame...
- The blame lies with nature?
- That's correct, Sire.
But we can't punish nature.
As reason dictates, Sire.
My heart is dead!
It will never thrive again.
Think of your responsibility, Sire.
I do.
Let reason govern.
Stop!
I have to pee!
Turn around!
What do you think, Leonora?
This is France?
I didn't expect much!
Announce my presence.
- Open for the King of France!
- I'll open.
- Sire.
- That's just her dwarf, Sire.
Long live the King!
No. You cannot enter!
Welcome, Sire.
You alone.
You may go.
I doubt there is any danger here.
Go.
You too.
Pardon me, my goddess.
I must get used to the fact
that we are already married.
A marriage of convenience
contracted in Florence
without us even meeting.
It is somewhat unusual.
It is colder here than in Florence.
We Medici love our city
and don't like having to leave it.
I can't understand you, dear wife.
Good!
Let's get to the task at hand.
As you know, this country needs an heir.
Leonora! Help!
My lady?
Madame, the two of us can manage.
You're not needed?
In accordance with our Father's order,
I will fulfill my duties.
Me too.
Slowly, dear husband, slowly.
What are you doing?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please. Sorry.
Noble Lords and Ladies, the Dauphin!
Our reign is assured!
Are you mad?
He is not a toy!
The Dauphin!
Louis de Bourbon!
- Who's that young woman?
- I think her name is Henriette.
Old goat!
I'll find you!
Where's the horny old goat?
Who do you mean, Madame?
You know exactly, you swine!
You'll find nothing here!
I can throw you in the dungeon.
- What for?
- For turning my husband's head!
Bitch!
Madame. Madame, it's unjust!
Who told you
to dance naked in front of the King?
Princess Margot.
Where is this Margot?
Alone. Banished to Auvergne.
She should stay there.
Pig!
I hate you!
You measly old goat! Pig!
You want to leave?
I'm asking you, Sire.
Forgive me
for having briefly imagined
that you were responsible
for Gabrielle's death.
Already forgotten, Sire.
Do not think leaving is easy for me.
Is it because of Marie?
Your wife...
is no Gabrielle.
I can see that you don't love her
and that saddens me.
We've been through a lot.
Enough to retreat
from the worldly stage.
I'll never forget you.
You'll remain in my heart...
until I die.
How is he?
He has a high fever.
May I speak to him?
Sire, allow me...
For some time something has been
weighing on my soul.
On mine as well.
Sire, your...
The love of your life...
Was poisoned.
Back then, I suspected
that the Pope would never
tolerate your marriage to Gabrielle.
I knew nothing about the poison.
Maybe I could have prevented it.
But I didn't.
Too late did I realise that Gabrielle
was the love of your life.
I was thinking only of France.
If you should condemn me now...
Forgive me.
We can't undo the past.
We can, however,
be honest with each other.
Like true friends.
Where does this garter come from?
You'll tell me, I suppose.
It was found under your bed!
- How nice.
- Nothing is nice.
A piece of your whore.
It is not mine!
The whole court...
Everyone says
you're a horny old goat!
Forbid them to say so.
I...
I became your wife for a lot of money.
That's all.
You don't love me.
You never have.
Why?
I bore you a son.
It was so important.
That's true.
I hate you!
I'll hate you for my whole life.
I'll cut your whore's head off!
Not as long as I am alive, Madame.
That could change.
You have many enemies.
The worst sits in front of me.
You want me to crown that woman,
knowing that she detests me?
It would be helpful, Sire.
Your son is too young
to govern this country
if something happened to you.
This is what reason dictates, is it not?
I hate you, Madame!
Be careful, little man.
You could break your neck.
Leave, little rat!
Monsieur Ravaillac! We welcome you.
Papa!
Mama is meeting a red man!
A red man?
Sounds dangerous, a red man.
He's red here and here.
Tu Rex gIoriae, Christe.
Tu Patris sempiternus es FiIius.
Tu ad liberandum
suscepturus hominem,
non horruisti Virginis uterum.
Tu, devicto mortis aculeo,
aperuisti credentibus regna caeIorum.
Papa!
Make way for the royaI coach!
Your Majesty!
Marie, look! Our King!
Stop the coach!
What's in your pot?
A chicken, Majesty.
Would you like some?
No, thank you.
Thanks to you,
with bacon and beans!
Another time!
You see?
Our efforts were not in vain!
Coachman, what's the matter?
She reminds me of my GabrieIIe.
Get him out!
Get him out of the coach!
Down with the Huguenots!
I've saved the world.
I've murdered that heretic!
Why doesn't anyone help?
Down with the Huguenots!
Sire!
Sire! Please God!
Your King is dying!
Someone help!
Coachman, drive!
The whole city is arming itself.
The people are crying out for action.
The Admiral must die.
- Give the order!
- I cannot! I cannot! Never!
Come.
We must leave to save our lives.
The King is a pathetic coward.
I'll kill you. I'll kill you all!
All of them.
Huguenots.
Protestants.
All of them!
Burnt! Quartered!
- The Admiral as well?
- Him too, my father.
Away with him!
Cross the street.
Hurry, they'II get away.
Henry, I've been looking for you!
The people are rebelling!
Against us Huguenots?
Your marriage didn't appease them,
quite the opposite. I think...
What?
We were lured to the city.
That's impossible.
Prince, both sides have suffered
so much injustice and death.
Peace cannot be decreed,
not even by the King.
Look at the people.
They want revenge, not reconciliation.
You said that violence is strong
but benevolence is stronger.
And so it is.
But one needs great strength.
Many do not have that.
- Seek safety. I have friends close by.
- No.
I must return to the Louvre.
To the right!
Now!
- Is it done?
- Yes, Lord! I've taken care of him!
I want to see him.
Throw him down!
It's him.
The Catholics!
A trap!
Defend yourselves!
We must find the King!
Only he can stop them!
Sire, open the door!
Open the door!
