Man: Previously on
They say...
The gateway to paris.
The entrance to paradise.
This city is impregnable.
-
-they are coming!
Whatever happens,
they must not get
through the gates.
They must not
get
into the city.
Show no mercy!
Fight on!
Your highness is
to be congratulated
For the brave defense
of our city.
Hail the emperor!
-Has my son died?
-I don't know.
Next time, we will not
make the same mistakes.
-All of this disaster
is my fault
-athelstan.
Paris is everything
you told me it would be.
And I am bound and determined
to conquer it.
How is bjorn?
Better.
I don't understand why
we failed, ragnar.
I did everything to make sure
we would succeed.
Ragnar: The others will
try again tonight.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Pour the oil!
The anti-christ
and the devils are here.
I pray to god
and our holy mother
that they will not get in.
But if, god forbid,
they were to do so,
Make sure they do not
capture you alive.
-
-
Destroy!
Siegfried: Sinric, you're
coming with us.
-You're our map of the city!
-
Release!
Retract! Again!
Move!
-Odo: Retract!
-
Man: It won't move!
Rollo!
Princess! Princess, please.
-
-
Ah!
Your highness!
Your highness!
You have to come.
Why?
The northmen are almost
inside the city.
What can I do to stop them,
that the holy mother
cannot do?
Odo: The men
are so hard-pressed.
So many killed,
So many wounded,
I cannot count them.
But if you were to walk
among them, it would
renew their courage.
It would restore
their strength,
just to see you.
Why? Does it not give
them courage to see you?
-You are their
commander.
-You are their emperor.
I beg you. In the name
of the holy mother, I beg you.
Come with me now.
Come with me
before it's too late.
You cannot speak for her,
count odo.
I thought you would come!
I thought I would not
have to plead.
Not when you heard
that our beloved city
was in mortal danger.
And why did
you think that, pray?
Because I know what your
grandfather would have done.
He would have put on
his armor and come
with us to the bridge.
Alas for you, count odo,
I am not like my grandfather.
I am not charlemagne.
Come!
Louis: Count odo! I put
my men at your disposal.
-The devils are not
attacking the walls!
-Thank god. Come quickly!
It may not be too late.
Ah!
Rollo!
We can't get through!
Fall back!
Fall back!
Don't abandon me.
â™ª
I am told you
speak our language,
But you were
with our enemies.
I have been here before.
I am a wanderer.
I have been to many places.
No one is my enemy.
He can, perhaps, be
of great help to us.
I would love to be
a great help to you. Whatever
it is you wish.
I belong to no country,
I belong to no people.
I just belong
to the wide, wide world.
-Who is that?
-Sinric: Earl siegfried.
There was someone else.
A great warrior.
He spiked our machine
and he did it alone.
I have never seen
a man of such strength
and such violence.
Who is he?
His name is rollo. He is
the brother of king ragnar,
The leader of the northmen.
He is a famous warrior.
He fights like
a crazy bear.
Your highness, this man,
Sinric, will be of use
to us.
Gisla: And this earl?
Perhaps he could be bartered,
fetch us a good price.
If you care for me at all,
count odo, you will
bring me his head.
-You wanted to see me,
my lord?
-Yes, yes.
How are you?
How are my grandsons?
How is alfred?
-Both are well.
-Good.
I have received news that
my son and your husband,
Aethelwulf, is even now
returning home.
His mission in mercia
was successful,
I'm pleased to say.
-Thank god.
-Indeed.
Thank god.
Judith, there are some things
That need to be said,
But other things which
only need to be understood.
I've promised you faithfully
That I will protect you
and your sons,
Especially alfred,
Against anyone
who might offer you
or him some injury.
You do understand what
I'm talking about, don't you?
We both know
what my son is capable of.
My protection I freely offer.
But...
there must be recompense.
Recompense.
My lord... Some reward?
Of course...
...Some reward.
Aslaug: Who is this young man?
-His name is ansgar.
-What is he accused of?
He is a stranger, a christian,
a missionary, so he claims.
He has been in the marketplace
denouncing our gods.
Aslaug: Is it true?
It's true that
I begged the people here
To desist from worshipping
false gods
And serving the devil.
Your gods are made
with human hands
And are deaf, dumb and blind.
What salvation
can they bring you?
Who being senseless
can save themselves?
I may admit that
your christ is a god.
But even so,
our gods are greater,
Their signs and wonders
mightier.
Is it not true?
No!
God, the father, the son
And the holy ghost
are the one god!
The rest are just false idols!
And will you subject
your bold assertions
To the judgment
of the gods?
I will.
Let us begin.
-
-
What might have been
is an abstraction,
Remaining a perpetual
possibility
Only in the world
of speculation.
What might have been
and what has been
point to one end,
Which is always present.
Footsteps echo
in the memory...
Is the reward
what I think it is?
...Down the passage
we did not take,
Towards the door
we never opened.
I don't understand.
Somehow, we are always here
at this moment,
You and I.
No, not always. Just now.
You're wise.
I'm not stupid.
The moon is a strange god.
I want you to be my mistress.
Then you will protect alfred?
Look after him?
get into the bed.
-
-
My god. My god.
So many.
Your highness,
in the last few days
Over 200 of our citizens
have succumbed to
This unknown sickness
and died.
God knows how many more
will likewise die.
What's more,
we're running out of
Fresh vegetables,
fresh fruits.
The city is beginning
to starve.
And yet, we won
a great victory?
Odo: We may have
repelled the pagans
And stopped them
from entering the city,
But that is not exactly
a victory.
Who knows? The next time
they may well succeed.
Your highness, we have lost
too many good men.
What is your advice?
I believe we must attempt
to come to terms with them.
There is, alas, no other way.
Father, I beg you,
Ignore this counsel
of despair.
We should never give in
to these vile pagans,
to these brutes.
Otherwise we will have failed,
And that is how
we would be judged.
Your highness,
I think you must...
Allow me some time to decide!
I understand both
these points of view,
But I must pray alone
and try...
And try to discover
the will of god.
A toast to my son.
I give thanks to god
for your success
and safe return.
Thank you, father.
I confess to you that
Queen kwenthrith tried
to use her female wiles
upon me,
But with god's help,
I managed to resist
the devil's snares.
I always knew she'd try
to win you over that way.
It's in her nature.
It's what she does.
But I also knew that you
would be able to resist her,
For your morals and faith
are such as even I look up to.
I'm sure your wife
Is also happy to hear
that you avoided temptation.
of course.
But... I am not so
much of a hypocrite
As to say so.
No longer be afraid of that.
However painful it was for me,
What happened between
you and athelstan,
was god's work.
It was for a higher purpose.
And although I can't
even guess at that purpose,
I am prepared to bow
before god's will.
I praise your attitude,
my son.
If only we were all so humble
and so righteous.
However... There is
Something I need
to ask you, father.
And you must forgive me,
but there is no help for it.
I need to ask you whether
you were prepared,
Secretly, to let
kwenthrith kill me
As the price you were
prepared to pay for
the conquest of mercia.
I was not.
And frankly the
accusation shocks me.
Let me say this to you,
No saxon king
has ever managed
To hand over their kingdom
peacefully and successfully
to their son and heir.
But I intend to be the first.
And what I intend
to pass on to you
Is not only
the kingdom of wessex,
But the kingdom of England!
Well, let me, in turn,
raise a toast
To my father.
The most loving,
loyal,
And true father
in the world.
My son.
Sinric.
I am saddened to see you
a prisoner.
After all,
you're a wanderer.
King ragnar,
-The franks want to discuss
a way to end the siege.
-Why?
They believe it would
be better for both sides.
Why would that
be better for us?
They don't believe you
are capable of breaching
the city walls.
-I say we are!
-What will they give us
if we lift the siege?
At a meeting between
you and the commander
of the city, count odo.
Bjorn: And where would we have
this meeting?
Because I know that
if my father enters the city,
He will be
captured or killed.
The count suggested
the meeting take place
outside the city walls,
With no weapons.
Tell them they'll have
their answer tomorrow.
Why should we make
any kind of deal with them?
Bjorn: We've lost
nearly a thousand men,
We can't breach the city,
and winter is coming.
Do you need more reasons?
Why do they offer terms,
if they are so sure
we can't get into the city?
They have probably
run out of food.
Then we should
let them starve.
Ah, then they will
hate us even more.
I have something to say.
I did not become earl
because I aspired to be one.
It came about because of
other peoples' actions.
And I did not become king
out of ambition.
But once again
I had no choice,
As a result of
other people's actions.
But nonetheless, I am king.
King ragnar! Hmm.
That is my name. King ragnar!
What does a king do, bjorn?
-He rules.
-Ragnar: Yes!
Good. He rules.
And as a ruler, I...
...Have the last say.
Me!
Not you! Not you!
Not you! And not you!
You have all had your ideas,
And they have all failed!
I will not.
Now, with no more discussion,
We shall meet
the franks tomorrow.
Ragnar: Come with me.
Give him to me.
Ivar.
Hmm.
-Ivar.
-
What is it?
What should we do
with the christian?
Kill him.
Ragnar is not here.
He's already left.
Sinric:
How much treasure do you want
to lift the siege and go away?
in gold and silver.
He urges you
to accept the offer.
Reinforcements are
on their way to paris.
Tell him I know that
no one is coming
to save him.
Ragnar:
And the offer is not enough.
There is something I also seek
that has no tangible worth,
But to me is more precious.
I want to be baptized.
He doesn't understand.
Ragnar: I am a dying man.
And when I die,
I want to be reunited
with my christian friend,
Who happens to be
in your heaven.
He says you will go to hell,
not heaven.
That is not
your decision to make.
Sinric: They will make
arrangements for the ceremony.
This is a man of god,
is it not?
And this is water, am I wrong?
You will do it here,
and you will do it now.
