A little white house
Lingers in my memory;
happiness
in that little
And so many joyous days
When I remember
those
Lingers in my memory;
-
-
He was 13 1/2 years old.
He had a lovely singing voice
and we heard him.
Lingers in my memory;
When I heard him again, my heart beat faster,
because what happened
here... was a murder.
it's hard to recognize, but it was here.
They burned people here.
A lot of people were burned here.
Yes, this is the place.
No one ever left here again.
The gas vans came in here...
There were two huge ovens,
And afterward,
the bodies were thrown
into these ovens,
and the flames reached to the sky.
-  To the sky?
- Ja.
It was terrible.
No one can describe it.
No one can...
recreate what happened here.
Impossible!
And no one can understand it.
Even I, here, now.
When they burned 2,000 people...
Jews... every day,
No one shouted.
Everyone went about his work.
girls
give their soldiers
They thought
the Germans made him sing on the river.
-
-
-
- He had to do it.
Do their hearts weep thinking about that now?
-
-  Certainly, very much so.
They still talk about it
around the family table.
I Polish 1
He said that was true German irony,
people were being killed,
and he had to sing.
That's what I thought.
What died in him in Chelmno?
Everything died.
But he's only human,
and he wants to live.
So he must forget.
__ The other survivor:
MICHAEL PODCHLEBNIK - ISRAEL
He thanks God for what remains
and that he can forget.
And let's not talk about that.
Does he think it's good to talk about it?
For me it's not good.
Then why is he talking about it?
Because you're insisting on it.
He was sent books on the Eichmann trial,
where he was a witness,
and he didn't even read them.
He survived, but is he really alive, or...?
At the time, he felt as if he were dead,
because he never thought he'd survive,
but... he's alive.
Why does he smile all the time?
What do you want him to do... cry?
Sometimes you smile, sometimes you cry.
And if you're alive, it's better to smile.
Why was she so curious about this story?
HANNA ZATDL
- ISRAEL -
Daughter of Motke Zaidl,
survivor of Vilna
it's a long story.
As a child,
I had little contact with my father.
He went out to work,
and I didn't see much of him.
Besides, he was a silent man,
he didn't talk to me.
And when I grew up
and was strong enough to face him,
I questioned him.
I never stopped questioning him
until I got at the scraps of truth
he couldn't tell me.
It came out haltingly.
I had to tear the details out of him,
and finally, when Mr. Lanzmann came,
I heard the whole story
for the second time.
MOTKE ZATDL
BEN SHEMEN FOREST
The place resembles Ponary: the forest, the ditches.
It's as if the bodies were burned here.
Except there were no stones in Ponary.
Ponary: forest where most
of the Vilna Jews were massacred
But the Lithuanian forests
are denser than the Israeli forest, no?
-
- Of course.
The trees are similar,
but taller and fuller in Lithuania.
FOREST OF THE EXTERMINATION CAMP
AT SOBIBOR
ls there still hunting here in Sobibor forest?
Yes, there are lots of animals of all kinds.
Was there hunting then?
Only man hunting.
JAN PIWONSKI
Some victims tried to escape.
But they didn't know the area.
At times people heard explosions
in the minefield.
Sometimes they'd find a deer
and sometimes a poor Jew
who tried to escape.
That's the charm of our forests:
silence and beauty.
But it wasn't always so silent here.
There was a time
when it was full of screams
and gunshots,
of dogs' barking.
And that period especially
is engraved on the minds of the people
who lived here then.
After the revolt, the Germans
decided to liquidate the camp,
and early in the winter of 1943,
they planted pines
that were three or four years old
to camouflage all the traces.
That screen of trees?
- Tak.
- Yes.
That's where the mass graves were?
- Tak.
- Oui.
When he first came here in 1944,
you couldn't guess
what had happened here,
that these trees were hiding
the secret of a death camp.
How did he react,
the first time he unloaded corpses,
when the gas van doors were opened?
What could he do? He cried.
The 3rd day,
he saw his wife and children.
He placed his wife
in the grave and asked to be killed.
The Germans said
he was strong enough to work,
that he wouldn't be killed yet.
Was the weather very cold?
It was in the winter of 1942,
in early January.
At that time,
the bodies weren't burned, just buried?
No, they were buried,
and each row was covered with dirt.
They dumped the bodies
in these ditches,
and they had to lay them out
like herrings, head to foot.
So it was they who dug up
and burned all the Jews of Vilna?
-
- Yes.
In early January 1944,
Whom in his family did he recognize?
Morn and my sisters.
They were all in there.
How could he recognize them?
ITZHAK DUGIN:
Survivor of Vilna
They'd been in the earth 4 months,
and it was winter.
They were very well preserved.
I recognized their faces,
their clothes too.
They'd been killed relatively recently?
And it was the last grave?
-
-
The Nazi plan was for them to open the graves
starting with the oldest?
The last graves were the newest,
and we started with the oldest,
those of the first ghetto.
In the first grave,
there were 24,000 bodies.
The deeper you dug, the flatter the bodies were.
Each was almost a flat slab.
When you tried to grasp a body,
it crumbled,
it was impossible to pick them up.
We had to open the graves,
but without tools.
They said, “Get used to working
with your hands.”
With just their hands?
When we first opened the graves,
we couldn't help it,
we all burst out sobbing.
But the Germans almost beat us to death.
We had to work
at a killing pace for two days,
beaten all the time, and with no tools.
They all burst out sobbing?
The Germans even forbade us
to use the words “corpse” or “victim.”
The dead were blocks of wood, shit,
with absolutely no importance...
Anyone who said “corpse”
or “victim” was beaten.
The Germans made us
refer to the bodies as “Figuren,”
that is, as puppets, as dolls...
- Schmattes.
- or as “Schmattes,” which means “rags.”
Were they told at the start!
how many “Figuren”
there were in all the graves?
and absolutely no trace
must be left of them.”
It was at the end of November 1942.
They chased us away from our work
and back to our barracks.
Suddenly,
from the part of the camp called
the death camp,
flames shot up very high.
In a flash, the whole countryside,
the whole camp seemed ablaze.
It was already dark.
We went into our barracks
and ate...
And from the window,
we kept on watching
the fantastic backdrop of flames
of every imaginable color,
red, yellow, green, purple.
And suddenly one of us stood up.
We knew he'd been
an opera singer in Warsaw.
His name was Salve, and...
-  Salve?
- Salve.
Facing that curtain of fire,
he began chanting a song
I didn't know:
“My God, my God,
why hast Thou forsaken us?”
RICHARD GLAZAR -

“We have been thrust
into the fire before,
but we have never denied
Thy Holy Law.”
on which they had begun
then, in November 1942,
TREBLINKA
When things were ready,
they poured on fuel
and touched off the fire.
They waited for a high wind.
The pyres usually burned
for 7 or 8 days.
There was a concrete platform some distance away,
where others had to crush them.
It was very fine,
that powdered bone.
Then it was put into sacks,
and when there were enough sacks,
we went to a bridge on the Narew river
and dumped the powder.
The current carried it off.
You never returned to Poland since?
No.
How can I face it?
My grandparents are buried in Lodz.
And, at one point, I heard
from somebody that visited Poland
that they want to level off the cemetery,
do away with the cemetery.
Now how can I return to that, to visit?
When did they die, your grandparents?
- My grandparents?
- Mm-hmm.
My grandparents died in the ghetto, quickly.
They were elderly,
and within a couple years...
Within a year, my grandfather died.
- And my grandmother the next year.
- In the ghetto?
In the ghetto, yes.

THE JEWISH CEMETERY
IN LODZ TODAY
AUSCHWITZ: THE TOWN
Mrs. Pietryra, you live in Auschwitz?
-
-
Yes, I was born here.
And you've never left Auschwitz?
-
-
Were there Jews in Auschwitz before the war?
They even had a synagogue here.
-  Just one?
-
- Just one, I think.
-  Does it still exist?
No, it was wrecked.
There's something else there now.
Was there a Jewish cemetery in Auschwitz?
It still exists. it's closed now.
- It still exists?
-
Yes.
Closed? What does that mean?
-
-
Was there a synagogue in Wlodawa?
-
-
Yes, and it's very beautiful.
I Polish 1
When Poland was ruled by the czars,
that synagogue already existed.
It's even older than the Catholic church.
-
- It's no longer used.
These buildings haven't changed?
-
-
Not at all.
There were barrels of herrings here,
and the Jews sold fish.
There were stalls, small shops,
Jewish business, as the gentleman says.
-
- That's Barenholz's house.
-
- He sold wood.
Lipschitz's store was there.
He sold cloth.
-
-  This was Lichtenstein's.
- Lichtenstein,
-  Lichtenstein,
-  What was there, opposite?
-
A food store.
-  A Jewish store?
-
There was a notions shop here,
it sold thread, needles, odds and ends,
and there were also three barbers.
PAN FILIPOWICZ
-  Was that fine house Jewish?
-  it's Jewish.
- And this small one?
-
-
- Also.
- And the one behind it?
-
These were all Jewish.
- This one on the left, too?
-
-
- That one too.
-
-  Who lived in it? Borenstein?
Borenstein.
-
- He was in the cement business.
He was very handsome, and cultivated.
Here there was a blacksmith
named Tepper.
-
-  It was a Jewish house.
A shoemaker lived here.
-  What was his name?
-
-
-  Yankel?
-
-  Yes.
You get the feeling Wlodawa was a Jewish city.
-
- Yes, because it's true.
The Poles lived farther out,
the center was wholly Jewish.
What happened to the Jews of Auschwitz?
-
-
-  What year was that?
-
It began in 1940,
which was when I moved here.
According to our information,
the Auschwitz Jews
were “resettled,” as they say,
nearby, in Benzin
and Sosnowiec, in Upper Silesia.
Yes, because those were Jewish towns.
Does she know what happened
to the Jews of Auschwitz?
I think they all ended up in the camp.
-  That is, they returned to Auschwitz?
-
AUSCHWITZ - BIRKENAU
All kinds of people from everywhere
were sent here.
-
- All the Jews came here... to die.
What did they think when
Wlodawa's Jews were all deported to Sobibor?
Wlodawa - Sobibor: 10 miles
What could we think?
That it was the end of them,
but they had foreseen that.
How so?
Even before the war,
when you talked to the Jews,
they foresaw their doom.
He doesn't know how.
Even before the war,
they had a premonition.
How were they taken to Sobibor? On foot?
It was frightful.
He watched it himself.
They were herded on foot
to a station called Orkrobek.
There, they put the old people first
into waiting cattle cars...
That was the worst:
They threw them on top of the others.
Were there a lot of Jews in Kolo?
-
-  A great many.
-
- More Jews than Poles.
And what happened to the Kolo Jews?
PAN FALBORSKI
-
- Yes. It was frightful.
Frightful to see.
Even the Germans hid,
they couldn't see that.
When the Jews were herded
to the station, they were beaten,
some were even killed.
A cart followed the convoy
to pick up the corpses.
-  Those who couldn't walk, the slain?
- Yes, those who'd fallen.
- Where did this happen?
-
The Jews were collected
in the Kolo synagogue.
Then they were herded to the station,
where the narrow-gauge railroad
went to Chelmno.
It happened to
all the Jews in the area, not just in Kolo?
-
-
Jews were also murdered
in the forests
There was a sign.
There was a small sign
on the station of Treblinka.
I don't know if we were at the station
or if we did not go up to the station.
ABRAHAM BOMBA - TEL AVIV, ISRAEL,
survivor of Treblinka
there was a small sign, very small sign,
which say “Treblinka.”
That was the first time in my life
I heard about that name “Treblinka,”
because nobody know.
It is not a place.
There is not a city.
Or it is not even a small village.

they're going to be free.

that's going to be good.

of the Yam lfijopur.
The day before Sukkoth,
there was the second transport.
I know, only in my heart I know,
that there's something that is not good,
if they take old people
and they send them away,
What they said is the y'd take them away
to a place where they would be working.
an old woman or a little child
from a week or four weeks or five years,
That was a foolish thing,
but, still, we had no choice.
-
-  He was born here...
-
- in 1923...
-
- and has been here even since.
He lived at this very spot?
- Tak. Oui.
-  R/jght here.
Then he had
a front-row seat for what happened.
-
- Naturally.
You could go up close
or watch from a distance.
CZESLAW BOROWI
They had land
on the far side of the station.
To work it, he had to cross the track,
so he could see everything.
Does he remember
the first convoy of Jews from Warsaw
-
- Yes.
and when all those Jews
were brought here...
people wondered,
“What's to be done with them?”
Clearly, they'd be killed,
but no one yet knew how.
When people began
to understand what was happening,
they were appalled,
and they commented privately
that since the world began,
no one had ever murdered
so many people that way.
While all this was happening before their eyes,
- They worked their fields?
-
Certainly they worked,
but not as willingly as usual.
but when they saw all this,
they thought,
“What if our house is surrounded
and we're arrested?”
Were they afraid for the Jews, too?
Well, he says it's this way:
If I cut my finger, it doesn't hurt him.
They saw what happened to the Jews:
The convoy came in
and then went to the camp,
and the people vanished.
I Polish 1
He had a field less than 100 yards from the camp.
He also worked
during the German occupation.
-  He worked his field?
- Yes.
He saw how they were asphyxiated,
he heard them scream, he saw that.
There's a small hill:
He could see quite a bit.
-
-  What did he say?
They couldn't stop and watch.
It was forbidden.
The Ukrainians shot at them.
But they could work a field
They could.
- So occasionally he could steal a glance...
-  Oui.
If the Ukrainians weren't looking.
-  He worked with his eyes lowered?
-
Yes.
I Polish 1
He worked by the barbed wire
and heard awful screams.
-  His field was there?
-
Yes, right up close.
It wasn't forbidden to work there.
-  So he worked, he farmed there?
-
Yes.
Where the camp is now
was partly his field.
It was off limits,
but they heard everything.
It didn't bother him to work
so near those screams?
At first it was unbearable.
Then you got used to it.
-  You get used to anything?
-
Yes.
Now he thinks... it's impossible.
Yet it was true.
So he saw the convoys arriving.
There were 60 to 80 cars
in each convoy,
and there were two locomotives
that took the convoys into the camp,
taking 20 cars at a time.
And the cars came back empty?
- Yes.
- Does he remember...?
Here's how it happened:
The locomotive picked up 20 cars
and took them to the camp.
That took maybe an hour,
and the empty cars came back here.
Then the next 20 cars were taken,
and meanwhile, the people
in the first 20 were already dead.
They waited, they wept...
-
- they asked for water, they died.
Sometimes they were naked
in the cars, up to 170 people.
This is where they gave
the Jews water, he says.
Where was that?
-
- Here.
When the convoys arrived,
they gave water to the Jews.
-  Who gave the Jews water?
-
We did, the Poles.
There was a tiny well,
we took a bottle and...
-  Wasn't it dangerous to give them
water? -
Very dangerous.
You could be killed
for giving a glass of water.
But we gave them water anyway.
Is it very cold here in winter?
-
-
- It depends.
-
Which was harder on the Jews,
summer or winter?
- Waiting here, I mean.
-
He thinks winter,
because they were very cold.
They were so packed in the cars,
maybe they weren't cold.
-
- In summer they stifled: It was very hot.
The Jews were very thirsty.
They tried to get out.
Were there corpses
in the cars on arrival?
Obviously.
They were so packed in
that even those still alive
sat on corpses for lack of space.
Didn't people here
who went by the trains
look through the cracks in the cars?
Yes, they could look in sometimes
as they went by.
When they were allowed,
they gave them water, too.
How did the Jews try to get out?
The doors weren't opened.
How'd they get out?
- Through the windows.
-
- They removed the barbed wire...
-
- Oui.
- Oui?
- and came out of the windows.
-
They jumped, of course.
Sometimes they just deliberately
sat down on the ground,
and the guards came
and shot them in the head.
I Polish 1
They jumped from the cars...
What a sight!
Jumping from the windows.
There was a mother and child.
-  Jewish?
- Yes.
She tried to run away,
and they shot her in the heart.
- Shot who... the mother?
- Yes, the mother.
This gentleman has lived here
a long time, he can't forget.
He says that now he can't understand
how a man can do that
to another human being.
It's inconceivable,
beyond understanding.
Once when the Jews asked for water,
a Ukrainian went by
and forbade giving any.
The Jewish woman
that had asked for water...
threw her pot at his head.
- Oui.
- Alors...
The Ukrainian moved back,
maybe ten yards,
and opened fire on the car.
Blood and brains
were all over the place.
Lots of people opened the doors...
Sometimes the Ukrainians
fired through the car walls.
It happened chiefly at night.
When the Jews talked to each other,
as he showed us,
the Ukrainians wanted things quiet,
and they asked...
yes, asked them to shut up.
So the Jews shut up
and the guard moved off.
Then the Jews started talking again,
in their language,
as he says, ra-ra-ra, and so on.
What's he mean, la-la-la?
What's he trying to imitate?
- Their language.
- No, ask him.
Was the Jews' noise something special?
- They spoke Jew.
-
- Does Mr. Borowi understand “Jew”?
-
No.
We were in that wagon.
The wagon was rolling, rolling
in the direction east.
Maybe it's not nice to say,
but I will say it.
Most of the people, not only most,
but 99% of the Polish people,
And they were laughing,
and they were all...
They had a joy,
because they took the Jewish people away.
What was going on in the wagon
between the people,
and the pushing and the screaming...
“Where is my child?”
and, “Where is my this?”
and “A little bit Of water!”
And people were not only starving,
but they were choking.
It was hot.
It happened... Just it happened...
The Jewish luck...
in September, at that time,
usually when it is rainy, when it is cool,
that it was hot like hell.
We had nothing inside.
For a child, you know, like my own child
about the age of three weeks,
there was not a drop of water.
There wasn't a drop of water for the mother,
but there wasn't a drop of water for anybody else.
Did he hear screams behind his locomotive?
Obviously, since the locomotive
was next to the camp.
The screams from the cars
closest to the locomotive
Can one get used to that?
No.
He knew that the people behind him
were human, like him.
-
-
The Germans gave him
and the other workers vodka to drink.
Without drinking,
they couldn't have done it.
that they were paid
not in money, but in liquor.
Those who worked on other trains
didn't get this bonus.
HENRIK GAWKOWSKI
He drank every drop he got
because without liquor
he couldn't stand the stench
when he got here.
They even bought more liquor
on their own
to get drunk on.
We arrived in the morning.
We arrived, I would say,
about 6:00, maybe 6:30.
I saw about 18, 20, maybe more,
wagons going away.
I saw the wagons coming back,
but without the people.
From the station
to the unloading ramp in the camp,
how many miles?
While we stayed there,
at that station over there,
some of those German SS,
they came around,
Give us the diamonds,
we bring you water.”
Yeah, they took away.
They didn't bring any water at all.
How long did last the trip?
The trip lasted
from Czestochowa to Treblinka
about 24 hours,
with interruption waiting in Warsaw
and also waiting at Treblinka
to go into Treblinka.
ABRAHAM BOM BA
At the last train, we went in over there.
But, like I mentioned before,
I saw many trains coming back,
but the trains were without the people.
So I said to myself,
“What happened to the people?
We don't see any people,
just trains coming back.”
We traveled for two days.
we saw that
we had left Czechoslovakia
In my compartment
there was an elderly couple.
The good man was always hungry
and his wife scolded him,
saying the y'd have no food lefi
for the future.
RICHARD GLAZAR
and rolled at' a walking pace
through a wood.
The old man
in our compartment saw a boy...
And the kid made a funny gesture. This!
Across the throat.
-  A Pole?
- A Pole.
Where was this? At the station?
It was where the train had stopped.
On one side was the wood,
and on the other were fields.
And there was a farmer in a field?
We saw cows
watched over by a young man,
a farmhand.
And one of you questioned him?
Not in words, but in signs, we asked,
“What's going on here?”
And he made that gesture. Like this.
We didn't really
pay much attention to him.
We couldn't figure out what he meant.
Once there were foreign Jews...
They were this fat...
This fat?
Riding in passenger cars.
There was a dining car,
they could drink
and walk around, too.
They said they were going to a factory.
On arrival, they saw
what kind of a factory it was.
We'd gesture...
-  Gesture how?
-
That they'd be killed.
These people made that sign?
He says the Jews didn't believe it.
But what does that gesture mean?
That death awaited them.
The people who had a chance
to get near the Jews
did that to warn them...
-  He did it too?
- That they'd be hanged, killed, slain.
Yes.
Even foreign Jews
from Belgium, Czechoslovakia,
from France too, surely.
And from Holland...
These didn't know,
but the Polish Jews knew.
In the small cities in the area,
it was talked about.
So the Polish Jews were forewarned,
but not the others.
Who'd they warn,
Polish Jews or the others?
All the Jews.
He says the foreign Jews
arrived here in passenger cars,
they were well dressed, in white shirts,
there were flowers in the cars,
and they played cards.
From what I know, that was very rare,
Jews shipped in passenger cars.
Most arrived in cattle cars.
It's not true.
-
-  it's not true?
What did Mrs. Gawkowska say?
She said he may not have seen everything.
He says he did.
Once, at the Malkinia station,
for example,
a foreign Jew left the train
to buy something at the bar.
The train pulled out
and he ran after it...
To catch up to it.
So he went past these “Pullmans,”
as he calls them,
those Jews who were calm, unsuspecting,
and he made that gesture to them.
To all the Jews, in principle.
He just went along the platform.
Ask him.
Yes. The road was as it is now.
When the guard wasn't looking,
he made that gesture.
Ask Mr. Gawkowski why he looks so sad.
Because I saw men
marching to their death.
Precisely where are we now?
It's not far...
a mile and a half from here.
-  What, the camp?
-
What's that dirt road he's indicating?
That's where the rail line
into the camp was.
Did Mr. Gawkowski,
aside from the trains of deponees
he drove from Warsaw or Bialystok
to the Treblinka station...
into the camp
from the Treblinka station?
-  'Yak.
- Oui.
Did he do it often?
-  Over how long a period?
-
That is,
throughout the camp's existence?
-  'Yak.
- Oui.
-  This is the ramp.
-
Here he is, he goes
to the end with his locomotive,
and he has the 20 cars behind him.
No, they're in front of him.
- He pushed them?
-
- That's right, he pushed them.
-
In February 1942,
I began working here
as an assistant switchman.
The station building, the rails, the platforms
are just as they were in 1942?
- Nothing's changed?
-
-
- Nothing.
Exactly where did the camp begin?
JAN PIWONSKI
I'll show you exactly.
Here,
there was a fence that ran
to those trees you see there.
And another fence
that ran to those trees over there.
So I'm standing
inside the camp perimeter, right?
That's right.
Where I am now
is 50 feet from the station,
and I'm already outside the camp.
-
-
Yes.
So this is the Polish part,
and over there was death.
Yes.
On German orders,
Polish railmen split up the trains.
it pushed the cars into the camp
on the other track we can see.
The ramp began there.
So here we're outside the camp,
and back here we enter it.
Unlike Treblinka,
the station here is part of the camp.
-
-
And at this point,
we are inside the camp.
This track was inside the camp.
And it's exactly as it was? Hmm?
Yes, the same track.
It hasn't changed since then.
Where we are now
is what was called the ramp, right?
Yes, those to be exterminated
were unloaded here.
So where we're standing
is where 250,000 Jews
were unloaded before being gassed.
Yes.
Did foreign Jews
arrive here in passenger cars, too?
-
- Not always.
-
- sometimes even in 1st class.
They were usually better treated
by the guards.
Especially the convoys
of Western European Jews
waiting their turn here,
Polish railmen saw the women
putting on make-up, combing their hair,
wholly unaware
of what awaited them minutes later.
They dolled up.
And the Poles
couldn't tell them anything:
The guards forbad contact
with the future victims.
I suppose there were fine days like today.
RUDOLF VRBA - NEW YORK, USA,
survivor of Auschwitz
There was a place called the ramp,
where the trains with the Jews
were coming in, in Auschwitz.
and sometimes one per day,
and sometimes five per day,
I saw those transports rolling
one after the other,
and I am sure that I have seen at least
two hundred of them, in this position.
I have seen it so many times
that it became a routine.
Constantly, people from the heart
of Europe were disappearing,
with the same ignorance of the fate
of the previous transports.
And that people in this mass...
And I knew, of course, that within
a couple of hours after they arrived there,
or something like that. I knew that.
And somehow, in my thinking,
it... I could...
It was difficult for me to comprehend
that people can disappear in this way,
and nothing is going to happen,
and then there comes the next transport,
and they don't know anything about
what happened to the previous transport,
and this is going on
for months and months, on and on.
AUSCHWITZ - BIRKENAU
Say, a transpon of Jews
was announced to come at 2:00.
So when the transport arrived
to close stations from Auschwitz,
We had to get up
and, uh, move to the ramp.
and under those lights
were the cordon of the SS.
There was one e very 10 yards,
with a gun in the hand.
So, we were in the middle,
the prisoners,
waiting for the train,
waiting for the next order.
Now, when all this was done,
everybody was there,
The locomotive,
which was always at the front,
That was the end of the line
for everybody who was on the train.
And, now, the train stopped,
and
the gangster elite marched on the ramp.
And in front of every second
or every third wagon,
and sometimes in front of every wagon,
one of those UnterscharfiJhrers
was standing with a key
and opened the locks,
because the wagons were locked.
Now, inside,
there were people, of course,
and you could see the people
looking through the windows,
because they didn't know what's happening.
They had many stops on their journey.
Some of them were 10 days on the journey.
Some were two days on the journey.
And they didn't know
what this particular stop means.
Now, the door was opened.
And the first order they were given was,
“AIIe heraus!”
“Everybody out!”
In order to make it quite clear,
they usually started with those walking sticks
to hit the first, the second,
the third, who were...
They were... They were...
They were like sardines in those cars.
If they expected on that day
four, five, six transports,
the pressure of getting out
from the wagons was high.
Then the y used sticks, clubs, cursing,
e! cetera, e2' cetera.
But, sometimes, the SS, if it was good weather,
they used to deal with it differently.
I mean, I was not surprised
if they were in a different mood and...
and, uh, exhibited a lot of humor,
like saying, “Good morning, Madam,”
and, “Will you please walk out?”
-  It happened?
- Oh, yes! Oh, yes.
And, “How nice that you arrived.
We are so sorry that it wasn't too convenient,
but now things will become different.”
When we came into Treblinka,
Some of them, they had armbands,
some of them red.
Some of them, they had blue,
Jewish kommando.
Falling out from the train
and pushing out each other
and, over there, losing each other,
and the... and the...
and the crying and the hollering.
And, coming out,
we started on one way
to the right, one to the left,
the women to the left
and the men on the right.
And...
we had no time to even look at each other,
because they start hitting over the head
with all kinds of things.
And...
it is very, very...
Painful, it was.
You didn't know what had happened.
You had no time to think.
All you heard is crying.
And all you heard, all the time,
was the hollering of the people.
And suddenly it started:
the yelling and screaming.
“All out, everybody out!”
All those shouts,
the uproar, the tumult!
“Out! Get out!
Leave the baggage!”
We got out, stepping on each other.
We saw men wearing blue armbands.
Some carried whips.
We saw some SS men.
Green uniforms,
black uniforms...
And I heard, “Get undressed!
You're to be disinfected!”
I noticed the SS men
separating out' some people.
A passing SS man
suddenly stopped in front of me,
“Yes, you too, quick,
join the others, get dressed.
You're going to work here,
and if you're good,
At my transport, I was waiting, already naked.
A man came over and asked,
“You, you, you, step out.”
and they know already
that they will not stay alive.
The hollering and the crying
and the shouting
it was impossible.
The cries and the hollers
was in your ears and in your mind
for days and days,
and, at night, the same thing.
From that hollering, you could not
even sleep a couple night of that.
All of a sudden,
at one time, everything stopped,
Then, they told us
to make clean the whole place.
It was about 2,000 people
which they undressed on the outside.
To take the whole thing away
and to clear up the place,
and that has to be done in minutes.
Some of the Germans,
some of the other people that were there,
the Ukrainians or the other ones,
they start shouting and hitting us
that we should do it faster,
to carry the bundles on our backs
faster to the main place,
where it was big places of clothes,
of shoes, of other things.
In no time, this was clean,
just like it never happened,
that never was people on that place again.
There was no trace, not at all.
Like a magic thing, everything disappeared.
BIRKENAUI THE RAMP
Whenever a new transport came,
the ramp was cleaned
absolutely to zero point.
No trace from the previous transport
was allowed to remain.
We were taken to the barracks.
were all the things people
could conceivably have brought.
On top of it,
jumping around like demons,
and I understood that I was also
to pick up clothing, bundle it,
"What is going on?
The undressed ones... Where are they?”
But it still hadn't sunk in,
I didn't believe it.
It was the first time
I'd heard Yiddish spoken.
He didn't say it very loud,
and I saw he had tears in his eyes.
Suddenly he started shouting
and raised his whip.
Out of the corner of my eyes,
I saw an SS man coming.
And I understood
that I was to ask no more questions,
but just to rush outside
with the package.
At that time, we start working
And still, I couldn't believe
what had happened
when we start to ask the people
which they worked before us
They said, “What do you mean, what happened?
Don't you know that?
They're all gassed. They're all killed.”
It was impossible to say something
because we were just like stones.
We couldn't mention
what had happened to the wife,
what had happened to the kid.
“What do you mean, wife?
What do you mean, kid?
Nobody is anymore alive!”
“What do you mean, they're not alive?
How could they...
How could they kill, how could
they gas so many people at once?”
But they had their way how to do it.
All I could think of
then was my friend Care! Unger.
in a section that had been uncoupled
and left outside.
I needed someone.
Near me. With me.
Then I saw him.
He was in the 2nd group.
On the way, somehow,
he had learned, he already knew.
He looked at me,
all he said was,
“Richard, my father, mother, brother...”
He had learned on the way there.
Your meeting with Carel:
how long after your arrival
did it happen?
It was... around 20 minutes
after we reached Treblinka.
that I soon learned
was called “the sorting place.”
It was buried under mountains
of objects of all kinds.
Mountains of shoes,
of clothes, 30 feet high.
We're shipwrecked.
And we're still alive.
That's how the day went through,
without anything.
No drinking.
We were 24 hours without water,
without anything.
We couldn't drink.
We couldn't have anything
taken into our mouths,
because it was impossible.
Just the meaning that before...
a minute, an hour before,
you were part of a family,
you were part of a wife or a husband,
and now, all of a sudden,
everything is dead.
We went into a special barrack,
where I was sleeping
right next to the wall.
And over there, that night,
it was the most horrible night
for all the people,
because the memory of all those things,
what people went through with each other,
all the joys and the happiness,
and the births and the weddings
and other things,
and all of a sudden, in one second,
to cut that through without anything,
and without any guilt of the people,
because the people were not guilty at all.
The only guilt from them was
because they were Jewish people.
Most of us, we were all up at night,
trying to talk to each other,
which was not allowed.
The commandant was sleeping
in the same barrack.
We were not allowed to talk to each other
or to express our view
or our minds to each other
until the morning, at 5:00,
we start going out from the barracks.
In the morning,
when they had an
to go out from the barracks,
from our group,
I would say at least
four or five were dead.
I don't know how
the thing happened that, what?
They must have with them
some kind of Zyanka/I or some kind of poison
in which they poisoned themselves.
Some of them there,
I would say at least of them
were me/ne friends...
two of my close friends.
They didn't say anything.
We didn't even know
that they have with them poison.
Greenery, sand everywhere else.
Each of us simply dropped
where he stood.
Half asleep,
I heard some men hang themselves.
We didn't react then.
It was almost normal.
Just as it was normal
that for everyone behind whom
the gate of Treblinka closed,
there was death, had to be death,
for no one was supposed
to be left to bear witness.
I already knew that,
three hours after arriving at Treblinka.
BERLIN
This is no longer home, you see?
when they start telling me that
they didn't know, they didn't know.
These were actions that were
taking place over almost two years.
There was always... Every fortnight
people were torn out of the houses.
How could they escape it?
How could they not see it?
I remember that day on which
they made Berlin JudenreKn.
The people hastened in the streets.
They... They didn't want to be in the street.
You could see the streets
were absolutely empty.
They thought of hastening to buy
what they had to buy.
It was Saturday, and they had to buy
something for the Sunday, you see?
So they went shopping
and hastened back into their houses.
because we saw police cars, uh,
rushing through the streets of Berlin,
They had herded together
from factories, from the houses,
and had put them into something
that was called Klu.
KIu was a dance, um, restaurant,
a very big one.
From there, they were deported
in various transports.
They were going off not far from here,
on one of the tracks of the Bahnhof Grunewald.
because now I knew we would be
one of the very few people left.
I didn't know how many more
would be underground.
And this was a day when I felt very guilty
that I didn't go myself,
that I tried to escape a fate
that the others could not escape.
There was no more warmth around,
no more soul akin to us, you understand?
And we talked about this.
“What happened to Elsa,
and what happened to Hans?”
“Where is he, and where is she?
Do you know this?”
“My God, what happened to the child?”
You know, these... these were
our talks on that horrible day.
And this feeling of being terribly alone
and terribly guilty that we did not go...
-  Guilty?
That we did not go with them.
Why did we try? Why? Why?
What made us do this,
to escape a fate that was really our destiny
or the destiny of our people?
INGE DEUTSCHKRON
Born in Berlin
Lived there through the war
Now lives in Israel
FRANZ SUCHOMEL:
SS UnterscharfiJhrer
-  Are you ready?
-  Yes.
- Then we can...
- We can begin.
How's your heart? Is everything in order?
Oh, my heart...
For the moment, ifs all right.
Of course.
-
- J
The barometric pressure is high:
That's good for me.
You look to be in good shape, anyway.
Let's begin with Treblinka.
- Certainly.
I think that's best.
- I believe you got there in August?
- Mme August.
- Was it August 20 or 24?
-
- The 18th?
- I don't know exactly.
J a .
- From Berlin?
- From Berlin.
From Berlin to Warsaw,
from Warsaw to Lublin,
from Lublin back to Warsaw
and from Warsaw to Treblinka.
Treblinka then was operating
at full capacity.
- Full capacity?
- Full capacity!
Trains arrived...
The Warsaw ghetto
was being emptied then.
Three trains arrived in two days...
each with three, four,
five thousand people aboard,
all from Warsaw.
But at the same time,
other trains came in
from Kielce and other places.
- Kielce?
So three trains arrived,
and since the offensive
against Stalingrad was in fear,
the trainloads of Jews
were left on a station siding.
What's more, the cars were French...
made of steel.
So that while 5,000 Jews
arrived in Treblinka,
- In the...
- In the cars.
They had slashed their wrists,
or just died.
The ones we unloaded
were half-dead
and half-mad.
We stacked them here, here,
here and here.
Thousands of people
piled one on top of another.
On the ramp?
- On the ramp.
Stacked like wood.
In addition,
other Jews, still alive,
waited there for two days:
The small gas chambers
could no longer handle the number.
They functioned
day and night in that period.
Can you please describe, very precisely,
your first impression of Treblinka?
Very precisely. it's very important.
My first impression of Treblinka,
and that of some of the other men,
was catastrophic.
For we had not been told
how and what...
that people were being killed there.
They hadn't told us.
- You didn't know?
- No!
Incredible!
But true. I didn't want to go.
- That was proved at my trial.
- Ja.
I was told,
“Mr. Suchomel,
there are big workshops there
for tailors and shoemakers,
and you'll be guarding them.”
- Ja.
- Nothing more.
But you knew it was a camp?
Yes. We were told,
“The Fuhrer ordered a resettlement program.”
- Ja.
- “It's an order from the Fuhrer.”
-
- Understand?
- Resettlement program...
-
- Ja.
No one ever spoke of killing.
I understand.
But don't use my name.
Und Dortmund...
All right, you've arrived at Treblinka.
So Sta-die, the sarge,
Naturally, that horrified
and appalled us.
We went back and sat down
on our suitcases
In the evening, the Ukrainians drove
those Jews into the gas chambers
The ground undulated like waves
because of the gas.
From the bodies?
: 3%:
Bear in mind, the graves
were maybe 18, 20 feet deep...
all crammed with bodies!
A thin layer of sand
and the heat. You see?
It was hell up there.
You saw that?
Yes, just once, the first day.
We puked and wept.
- You wept?
- We wept too, yes.
Ja.
- The smell was infernal.
-
Yes, because gas
was constantly escaping.
It stank horribly, for miles around.
- Miles?
- Miles!
- You could smell it all around...
-
Not just in the camp?
Everywhere. It depended on the wind.
The stink was carried on the wind.
Understand?
More people kept coming, always more,
Those gents were in a rush
to clean out the Warsaw ghetto.
The gas chambers
couldn't handle the load.
They may not have been certain,
but many knew.
who slashed
their daughters' wrists at night,
They heard the engine
feeding the gas chamber.
A tank engine was used
in that gas chamber.
At Treblinka, the only gas used
was engine exhaust.
“We can? go on this way.
I can? do it any longer.
The corpses lying there
were cleared away.
That was the period
of the old gas chambers.
Because there were so many dead
that couldn't be gotten rid of,
for days and days,
the bodies piled up
around the gas chambers.
Under this pile of bodies
was a cesspool:
and shit.
- Where?
- In front of the gas chamber.
- Ja.
- Nicht wahr?
No one wanted to clean it out.
The Jews preferred to be shot
rather than work there.
- Preferred to be shot?
-
It was awful. Burying
their own people, seeing it all...
The dead flesh came off in their hands.
So Wirlh went there himself
with a few Germans
and had long belts rigged up
that were wrapped
around the dead torsos to pull them...
- Who did that?
- SS men.
- Wirth?
- SS men and Jews.
- SS men and Jews!
-
- Jews too?
- Jews too!
What did the Germans do?
They forced the Jews to...
They beat them?
Or they themselves helped
with the cleanup.
Which Germans did that?
Some of our guards
who were assigned up there.
The Germans themselves?
They had to.
They were in command!
They were in command,
but they were also commanded.
I think the Jews did it.
In that case,
the Germans had to lend a hand.
THE BLACK EXECUTION WALL
IN THE COURTYARD OF BLOCK ll
AT AUSCHWITZ I,
THE ORIGINAL CAMP
Filip, on that Sunday in May 1942,
when you first entered
the Auschwitz crematorium,
Twenty.
We were locked
in an underground cell in Block 11.
and marched us
along a street in the camp.
I thought they were taking us
to be shot.
FILIP MULLER - CZECH JEW
Survivor of the  liquidations
of the Auschwitz “special detail”
under a lamp
in the middle of this building,
Right away, the stench,
the smoke choked me.
Between the ovens,
some Jewish prisoners were working.
We were in the crematorium's
incineration chamber
It was like a blow to the head...
as if you'd been stunned.
how they managed
to kill so many people at once.
Suddenly, an SS man
rushed up and told me,
“Get out of here! Go stir the bodies!”
What did he mean,
“Stir the bodies”?
I entered the cremation chamber.
There was a Jewish prisoner,
Fischel, who later became
a squad leader.
He looked at me,
and I watched him
poke the fire with a long rod.
He told me, “Do as I'm doing
or the SS will kill you.”
I picked up a poker
and did as he was doing.
A poker?
A steel poker.
I obeyed Fischel's order.
At that point I was in shock
as if I'd been hypnotized,
ready to do
whatever I was told.
I was so mindless, so horrified
that I did everything Fischel told me.
So the ovens were fed,
but we were so inexperienced
that we left the fans on too long.
- The fans?
- Yes.
There were fans to make the fire hotter.
- Mm-hmm.
They worked too long...
The firebrick suddenly exploded,
blocking the pipes
linking the Auschwitz crematorium
with the smokestack.
We were ordered
to unload the bodies
Suddenly, water gushed up
from underground
When night came,
we had to stop that horrible work.
Some SS men came
with a fire truck
We had to go down
into that muddy pit
But they were slimy.
For example, I grasped a woman,
but her hands...
Her hand was slippery, slimy.
I tried to pull her,
but I fell over backward,
into the water, the mud.
It was the same for all of us.
Up above, at the edge of the pit,
Aumeyer and Grabner yelled,
“Get cracking, you filth, you bastards!
We'll show you, you bunch of shits!”
These were the names they were calling us.
And in these...
How shall I say?
...circumstances,
of my “friends”
couldn't take any more.
One was a French student.
- Ja?
-Juden?
All Jews! They were exhausted.
They just lay there...
in the mud.
Aumeyer called one of his SS men.
“Go on, finish off those swine!”
They were exhausted.
And they were shot in the pit.
There was no crematorium at Birkenau then?
No, there weren't any there yet.
Only Camp BI, which was
the late women's camp, existed.
that skilled workmen
and unskilled laborers, all Jews,
a big undressing room,
around 3,000 square feet,
where up to 3,000 people at once
could be gassed.
TREBLINKA
The new gas chambers
were built in September 1942.
Who built them?
Hackenhold and Lambert supervised
the Jews who did the work,
I think they were brought
from Bialystok,
