This is a true story.
I've told it as it happened,
unadorned.
Here, under German occupation,
at the hands of the Nazis.
A MAN ESCAPED
OR
THE WIND BLO WETH
WHERE IT LISTETH
I could feel
I was being watched.
I didn't dare move.
Nothing broken,
but I wasn't a pretty sight.
I cleaned myself up.
The charges against me
were so heavy,
and I'd aggravated them so.
Why didn't they shoot me?
In the courtyard,
I got used to the idea of dying.
I would have preferred
immediate execution.
My neighbor's knocking
was of no help.
My courage abandoned me
for a moment, and I cried.
I slept so soundly
the guards had to wake me up.
Get up!
Instinctively,
I pretended to be too weak.
I made enormous efforts
just to sit up.
Did that little trick
save my life?
They threw me back,
and I was alone again.
My cell was less
than 3 meters by 2.
It was furnished sparsely:
A wooden frame with a mattress,
two blankets.
In a recess by the door,
a sanitary pail.
And set in the wall,
a stone shelf.
This shelf enabled me
to reach the window.
In the courtyard
in front of me...
three men,
well dressed and clean shaven,
circulated freely.
Be careful.
I'll be back.
- Your name?
- Fontaine.
I'm Terry.
Can I get messages out?
I know a way.
I knew I had to be wary.
Catch this.
Because a stranger
"knew a way"
everything had already
changed for me.
Despite the handcuffs,
I managed to wash my face
and wounds.
I was soon able to communicate
with my neighbor.
A young blacksmith,
he killed a German
during a brawl.
He was awaiting
the firing squad.
He was 19.
With his string
and my handkerchief,
I made a sort of sack.
Give me your letters tomorrow.
To give my family hopes
I myself didn't have...
but mainly to warn my leaders
that the transmitter I was using
was helping the Germans,
who had broken our code.
I decided to run the risk.
And what a risk!
Giving letters to a stranger
was putting myself and my group
in great danger.
We could have been seen
or taken by surprise.
Do you have a pin?
A pin?
Wait.
He went towards
the women's barracks.
A gift from them.
On the paper,
written by a woman,
the word "Courage."
There was also the pin.
My neighbor had explained how,
but it took a while.
I didn't think it possible.
I stretched my arms
and my sore wrists.
I felt a sudden sense
of victory.
As a special favor,
the head guard allowed Terry
to see his daughter.
I learned this much later.
I had no idea of the risks
he and his daughter
were running.
Once back home, she stamped
and posted the letters.
Your letters left yesterday.
They'll arrive today.
Thank you.
You've done your duty.
That should help you make it.
Look!
Be careful.
So, Lieutenant Fontaine.
Have you accepted your failure?
Let me be frank.
I'd have jumped
from the car too.
Now promise me
you'll no longer try to escape.
I promise.
What was this game?
He obviously didn't believe me.
As for me, I decided to escape
as soon as possible.
Did he expect to see me
jumping at my grub?
My first meal in four days.
I spent more and more time
at the window.
I studied the courtyard,
the walls, and the infirmary.
Unconsciously,
I was getting ready.
I knew that executions
took place within the prison.
A terrible thought
crossed my mind.
He was there.
I spent the day tapping
the Battalion Song
which he'd asked to learn.
That was all the help
I could give him.
The next day,
the head guard came for me.
Jacket.
Towel.
I left the first floor
for cell 107 on the top floor.
On my right, no one.
An empty cell.
On my left, a neighbor
who didn't answer my tapping.
I stared at their faces,
to see what they were like.
I also stared at the walls.
Newcomer?
I was downstairs
for 15 days...
or 15 years!
You get used to it.
Take it from me.
My name is Hebrard.
No talking!
Mine is Fontaine.
After emptying our pails
and washing our faces,
we'd go back to our cells
for another 24 hours.
Nothing to do, no news,
living in terrifying solitude,
we were a hundred or so
awaiting our fate.
I had no doubt about mine.
To escape.
To flee.
Luck and idleness
gave me my first chance.
I often sat facing my door,
with nothing to do
besides staring at it.
It was made of two panels
of six oak boards,
set in frames equally thick.
In a crack between two boards
I saw that the wood joining them
wasn't oak.
It was another color:
Beechwood, or poplar.
There was definitely a way
of taking apart this door.
I needed an iron spoon.
Pewter and aluminum
were too soft.
I had to wait out
several meals.
I made a kind of chisel.
No, the boards weren't attached
by mortise-and-tenon joints
in the same oak,
but by strips of soft wood
that my tool could pick away at.
I figured I would need
to dig through one strip,
by cutting or chipping away
the wood.
But each evening
at the same time,
I had to get some air.
I couldn't work fast,
because of the noise I made
and the constant fear
of being caught.
I kept having
to sweep under the door
with a piece of straw
from my broom.
Fontaine, are you there?
Is that you, Terry?
At last. I missed you.
I'm leaving.
They're letting you go?
They're taking me
God knows where.
How did he avoid the guards
and get to my cell?
I never knew.
My neighbor downstairs?
Shot two days ago.
Farewell.
Terry's departure,
and the death
of that unseen friend,
left me in despair.
I kept on working.
It stopped me from thinking.
I had to open this door.
I had no other plans.
A new inmate,
Pastor de Leyris,
took on my trust
and my need for friendship.
They arrested me at my pulpit.
I couldn't take anything.
Nothing?
I used to dream of being alone
someday with my Bible...
I don't have a Bible,
but I have a pencil.
That's plenty.
You have to keep busy...
write, try staying sane.
I do.
Three boards
would give me room enough.
Facing me,
someone kept guard.
It made my job a lot easier.
But my neighbor's silence
troubled me.
We can talk.
They're all downstairs.
Are you scared?
I knew he was there.
I was sure of it.
He scared me so much,
I no longer dared touch my door.
I plugged up the holes
with paper
I'd soiled on the floor.
He looked at us, distraught.
That evening at the window,
Blanchet...
that was his name...
Dollars, Mr. Blanchet?
Dollars belonging to you?
No, to a Jewish lady.
I'd never seen her before.
She gave them to me
the day she was captured.
How did they find out?
A letter in a pile of laundry.
They'll let you go.
No.
What can I do for you?
Nothing.
There must be something.
If you want to help me,
stop scratching.
You'll get the whole floor
punished.
After three weeks,
working as quietly as possible,
I was able to separate,
lengthwise, three boards.
But they were still
in the frame,
fastened by joints
which bent my spoon.
To dislodge them from the frame
I needed another spoon.
Only then could I force them
hard enough.
The Bible?
I'm lucky.
A miracle!
Since yesterday,
everything is different.
Silence! No talking!
I'm lucky too.
I busted the frame,
but more than I'd intended.
I was able to put the piece
back in place.
Why do it?
To fight.
Fight against the walls,
against myself, my door.
Mr. Blanchet,
you should fight too.
And hope...
Hope what?
To go home. To be free.
Free?
Someone's waiting for you...
No one.
A friend?
I have no friends.
Fight anyway.
Fight for everyone here.
Watching only after yourself...
What do you do, then?
I watch you.
And that gives me courage.
If I had courage,
I'd kill myself.
I tried.
I made a noose with my shoelace.
The nail fell.
So?
I heard someone knocking.
It was me.
Why didn't you answer?
Why?
I was afraid that someone
would open or close my door
violently.
Fortunately,
I handled it myself.
- How are you?
- Fine.
His wife denounced him,
betrayed him.
Things like that happen...
In life.
How repulsive.
Her life isn't worth much.
He didn't kill her?
Almost.
We thought he'd go crazy.
Now he's another man.
His face no longer knows
hatred or suffering.
His name is Orsini.
Talking about me, Father?
I said you are courage
incarnate.
After one month's work
my door was open.
What took a lot of time
was putting it back in place.
Inside, no rounds, no guards.
There was nothing special
about roaming the corridor.
But I had a goal.
No food and exercise.
What is it?
It's me. Cell 107.
Impossible.
Hold out.
If I have to,
I'll come back tomorrow.
His astonishment
made me happy.
That night,
I fell asleep less unhappy.
It was you in the corridor.
Don't lie.
It was me.
You'll leave.
How will you do it?
I have absolutely no idea.
The head guard and the Sergeant
slept on the second floor.
The Corporal
on the first floor,
near the door
to which he had the key.
This door remained locked
at night.
I considered
every possible alternative,
and even impossible ones.
I made a thousand plans.
None was good.
Read and pray.
God will save you.
Only if we give him a hand.
You never pray?
Sometimes.
When things are bad?
That's easy.
Too easy.
It would be too easy
if God handled everything.
You're the only one here
to think of escaping.
The only one,
because it's impossible.
Take me.
You won't make it.
I have to.
The military call it
a reconnaissance mission.
Be careful.
If at 10 o'clock,
I'm not in the corridor...
At 10 o'clock,
I was under the skylight.
I feared the worst.
The plan for leaving the prison
and how to dismantle your door.
Read it and tear it up.
Trust me,
but I'm not "courage incarnate."
If you can forgive and forget...
I think about it,
but it's as if it happened
to someone else.
Trust me.
It will work.
Twelve meters of rope
strong enough to support a man.
That's what I needed.
The netting of the bedstead
provided me with 40 meters
of strong wire.
I made my first piece of rope
with the bolster.
I stuffed its horsehair
into the mattress.
I folded the cloth in quarters,
the borders inside,
to avoid fraying.
I twisted it hard.
Wrapping wire
in the opposite direction
let me keep the cloth twisted.
Your door?
I'll try again.
Try, Orsini.
Try again.
Tomorrow I'll tell you
if we split up or not.
What's wrong?
Too long, too complicated.
All of it.
It's the only way.
There's another.
Say it.
During our walk,
with two ropes and two hooks.
What hooks?
He didn't say.
And the guards doing rounds?
He waits till they pass.
Where?
On the roof.
He climbs up the drainpipe
and hides.
In broad daylight,
they'll spot him.
His plan is no good.
The next day,
I couldn't talk to Orsini.
He was taken in
for questioning.
So, the questioning?
They reassure us, threaten us...
You know their tactics.
Orsini is happy.
- How is everything?
- Fine.
You have to keep calm.
- Are you giving up?
- They're freeing me.
- Do you believe them?
- Yes.
You're right to.
Orsini!
I was so closely watched
for 8 days,
we lost contact.
What was he up to?
I didn't understand.
