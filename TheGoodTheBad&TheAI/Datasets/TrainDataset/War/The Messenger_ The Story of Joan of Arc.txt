THE MESSENGER
Is anybody there?
Jeanne...
I'm always happy to see you
but to keep coming 3 times a day...
I need to confess.
You already did this morning.
I need to confess again.
What is this terrible sin
that can't wait till tomorrow?
I saw a poor monk without shoes...
so I gave him some.
There is no sin in charity.
They weren't mine.
Whose were they?
My father's.
He'll forgive you.
He already did,
but I want Jesus to forgive me too.
If we were to ask forgiveness
all the time
we'd spend our life in church.
Is that bad?
Well no, but...
Are you happy at home?
Yes... very.
Everything's fine with your mother?
Yes, she's... wonderful.
You sister Catherine
is still your best friend?
My sister's just...
She's wonderful!
And your other friends?
You don't like
playing with them?
I play with them.
Lots!
So everything sounds "wonderful".
Yes, it is.
Why do you come so often?
I feel safe here,
where I can talk to him.
"Him"?
I try to talk to him,
but he does most of the talking.
Who is this...
"he"?
He never says his name.
What...
does he... look like?
Beautiful.
What does he say to you?
He says...
He says I must be good,
and help everyone,
and take care of myself.
Is he coming from the sky?
Perhaps.
Wherever he's coming from,
I think you should
listen to him. It sounds like
he's giving you very good advice.
It's... wonderful!
Mother!
Catherine!
Jeanne!
Did they hurt you?
No, I'm fine.
Where were you?
The English are everywhere!
I was with the priest.
You know what he said to me?
Tell me later. Hide in here!
Where'll you be?
Right here... I promise.
Well, that's what I call booty!
A woman with a sword!
Look at this!
Frenchmen are such cowards
they have women fight!
If that's God's will,
then so be it.
Fine with me. I love women.
Hold still, bitch!
Stop wriggling about!
Your turn now.
God bless the soul of this departed.
Keep us safe
from fear and sin.
Listen, Jeanne.
You will stay with your aunt
and uncle for a while.
Just to give us time
to rebuild things.
You understand?
Lord, teach us always
to love this land and to save it
from those who seek to destroy it.
Goodnight.
What'll happen to her?
She'll be fine.
She'll grow up, find a man,
have children.
Don't worry.
She'll survive.
Tomorrow,
she'll be as right as rain.
You'll see.
I want to see a priest.
Why did she have to die?
Only God can answer that.
Jesus says to love your enemies
but I can't.
I want the English to burn in hell
for ever and ever!
I realise your anger,
but we must learn
to forgive.
Revenge will never
bring about peace.
Then what will?
What will bring her back?
Why did she have to die
instead of me?
Why didn't he take my life?
It's my fault. I was late,
she gave me her hiding place.
Why did He save me?
Calm down, Jeanne.
I don't pretend to know God's will,
but one thing I am sure of:
The Lord always
has a good reason.
Perhaps he chose you
because he needs you
for some higher calling.
So, as long as you answer that call,
your sister will not have died in vain.
I don't want to wait for His call.
Be patient.
I want to be with Him always!
Soon you'll be able
to take part in the Holy Mass.
When you eat of His flesh
and drink of His blood,
you will be at one with Him.
I want to be at one with Him now!
So what did he say?
We must bring her to church
whenever she wants.
Easy for him...
He's not doing the bringing!
This is important.
We mustn't let her out of our sight.
Don't worry.
I'll watch her
like my own shadow.
I want to be at one with You now!
A message for the Dauphin of France.
Captain,
a message for the Dauphin.
I'll take it.
The Dauphin!
Louis!
Shouldn't you be studying?
No, I want to fight!
You will.
But first, learn to wipe your nose.
A letter for His Majesty.
Another one from this
"Maiden of Lorraine"!
I can read, you know.
She pretends to be sent by God.
Charlatans! And not enough
wood to burn them all...
She'll be here tomorrow.
Don't see her, my Lord.
Who knows if she's really from Lorraine?
What difference would it make?
If she comes from Burgundy,
it might be a trap.
"Signed X".
What sort of a name is "X"?
A messenger of God
can't even write her own name?
Trémoïlle is right.
She says she hears voices.
She may be a witch!
Regnault!
You see witches everywhere.
She's just a peasant.
A peasant who... cares about her king.
All she wants is to see me crowned
and to fight for me.
No. She wants you to give her
an army at your expense.
Since your mother stole
most of the Treasury,
I fail to see
how you can afford this.
I can see her if I want to.
As the English hold half of France,
what have I to lose?
The other half.
You mustn't see her.
She may be an instrument of the Devil.
I think you should.
How amusing! I'd love to know
why my devoted
mother-in-law thinks one thing
and my two most loyal advisors
think precisely the opposite.
Because I care about you.
Come here.
Your health and happiness
have been my priority
ever since you were a little boy.
I know you better than your mother.
You think so?
I know the sickness
that plagues your heart,
how painful it is to have loved
a father, without knowing
if he was really yours.
Do I know you enough?
What's that got to do
with this Maiden?
Who better than a messenger from God
to give you answers?
You think she was sent from God?
You're a fine judge of character.
You'll soon expose her
if she's a fake.
But... if she's not,
she'll give you your answers
and your crown.
I think it's going
to take more than a peasant...
I don't care what you think
or even what I think
but what simple people think!
Up and down the country
they are already talking about her.
Simple people are always ready
to believe any old prophecy.
Like this one.
About a virgin from Lorraine
saving France.
And now,
this girl comes along...
from Lorraine.
And there's a spark of hope
in their simple minds.
We shouldn't disappoint them.
If they believe in her
to put back the fire in our army,
then I believe in her too.
Stop, Louis!
Be quiet for once!
- She's coming, your Majesty.
- Alright.
Calm yourself.
I urge you not to see her.
It reeks of a Burgundian trap.
For my astrologers, the timing is good:
Leo, with Virgo rising.
On the astrological chart,
the virgin is next to the lion.
Supposing she's an assassin?
My dear Trémoïlle,
I'm not even king yet.
Who would want to kill me?
She's in the guards' room!
Fine.
I suppose
I'll have to make a decision.
Why is life so complicated?
Sometimes I wish
I were someone else.
Good idea, Sire.
What do you mean?
Let someone else pretend
to be you, and see if...
If she can find me?
Brilliant idea!
If she's sent by God,
she will guess.
If not, she will kill the wrong man.
Brilliant!
Please!
We're going to play a little game.
Now, let us pretend
that my throne is empty.
Just pretend!
Who wants to be king?
There's a heart-warming sight!
Now let us see...
Which one of you
could possibly pass
as the King of France?
Alençon...
My noble duke, my royal cousin,
so fine, so rich...
Far too rich
to be the King of France.
Everyone knows
I'm the poorest in my kingdom.
Gilles de Rais, Marshal of France...
Formidable to men,
fascinating to women,
feared by all.
You'd be perfect to sit on my throne.
So perfect,
that you might like it too much
and disturb
my fragile peace of mind.
La Hire, my angry captain...
The bravest in France.
Scarred by 12 wars,
but with a heart for 12 more.
You could pass for the king.
Damn bloody right!
But no one with a tongue like that
could pass for King of France.
Seems it'll have to be me after all.
Why not you?
Jean d'Aulon!
The only man
who's poorer than I,
so the only man I can trust.
Dignified, honourable, wise...
What more can we ask of a king?
I'm not sure that...
You're not ready to die
for me?
Of course I am.
Until then, live like a king!
Bring her up!
Sire,
I am bad at this sort of game.
Pretend it's not a game.
- Mother...
- Not now!
I've come to see the Dauphin.
Who are you?
I'm...
His most gracious Majesty
Charles de Valois,
Dauphin of France.
I can see you are a good man,
but you're not the Dauphin.
Sorry to insist,
but I must see him.
We've no time to lose, where is he?
He's here.
Find him yourself.
Now you'll see
who'll pass for a king.
There's no need to be afraid, Sire.
I'm not the King.
I know you're not yet,
but you will be soon.
Out!
How did you know?
- Her "voices"!
- They said:
"The one in the corner
with a big nose."
Oh, my gentle Dauphin!
I have a message
from the King of Heaven.
For you!
You only.
Follow me.
Trémoïlle,
I know I can count on you...
As always, Majesty.
...to ensure our privacy,
I need to talk to her alone.
He needs to talk to her alone.
Fine.
I was about ten.
On a sunny spring day,
I was walking home
when a strange wind
began to blow.
It was such a strange sound,
almost like words,
calling me.
The second time
was many years later.
I was coming back from church,
when suddenly,
the same...
violent wind...
Then,
a shape
appeared
in the middle of the sky.
The shape...
of a man.
Everything was moving so fast.
The wind, the clouds...
I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe.
I was so... afraid.
He was...
so...
here!
Then I knew God had chosen me,
but I didn't understand
what my mission was.
What could I do?
Help my country but how?
I was just a poor girl!
I didn't know anything
about making war or riding.
So I decided to wait
and not to speak of it
- to anybody.
- You did well.
I didn't wait long.
I was going to Mass,
like I do every day,
when the same...
strange wind...
Everything was made clear.
God had given me a message.
A message to deliver.
What was the message?
He said,
I must save France
from her enemies
and bring her back
to the hands of God.
And He told me that I...
Jeanne,
will lead you to the altar at Rheims,
where you will be crowned
the King...
of France.
- Sire...
- I'm fine.
Jean d'Aulon,
my loyal friend and finest archer.
Jean, I put her in your care.
Find her suitable lodgings
in the castle
and guard her with your life.
No lodgings
if we're to march on Orléans.
It has held out for 6 months,
a few days won't make a difference.
Take some rest.
Put the bags here.
Forgive me for pretending to be...
May I have some water?
Water? Yes, of course.
- Anything else?
- A priest.
Now?
Yes. I didn't confess today.
Anything else?
I shall also be needing
a new war horse, a sword,
armour and an artist to make a banner
- for me.
- Now?
Better today than tomorrow.
This might take a little time.
I'll see what I can do.
And someone who can
read and write.
I can. I was studying in Paris
until the English invaded it.
Aren't you an archer?
Yes, I am.
Who can read and write.
Who is the letter for?
The King of England.
To give him the chance
to leave in peace,
before I get to Orléans.
The Archbishop and I are negotiating
to bring the Burgundians
over to our side.
Negotiate,
but from a position of strength.
If the English take Orléans,
the whole country will be theirs.
My Lady,
it would be folly to let this... child
lead our army in the King's name
without verifying her true motives.
Trémoïlle is right.
We must be certain
that she isn't
an instrument of the Devil.
How can anyone
be absolutely certain about anything?
Intuitions may be our best counsellors.
We must listen to our Church
before our intuitions.
Wait!
She claims to be a virgin.
That we can examine
and be absolutely certain about.
Let's find out.
What if she's not?
If she's not,
I'll kill her myself.
There is no sign
of corruption or violation.
She is intact.
What exactly was this "vision" wearing?
I don't remember.
Did it give you anything,
an object, a ring, a rosary,
anything by which
we can verify your claim?
He gave me good advice.
As a child,
did you have any military experience?
Can you wield the sword?
No, but I'm good with a stick.
Do you know what a Dijon Culverin is?
No.
An item of artillery.
How do you expect to free Orléans
if you don't know?
The road to Orléans is long.
I have good captains with me.
I'll learn fast, believe me.
We would like to, Jeanne.
But if God wanted us to believe you,
he would have sent a sign
with you...
So, can you do something?
Show us something?
A sign
to prove that you are sent by God?
I didn't come here to perform tricks.
You are all much cleverer than I am.
Me, I don't know A from B,
but this much I do know:
While the people in France
lie bleeding,
you sit around in fine clothes,
trying to deceive me,
when you're only deceiving yourselves.
You say you are men of God,
yet you do not see
His hand guided me
through 500 leagues
of enemy country
to bring you His help.
Is that not proof enough?
Do you still need more signs?
Give me an army.
Take me to Orléans.
There you'll see the sign
I was sent to make.
Dunois!
What?
A big one! Straight at us!
What side?
Window side.
Dunois!
What?
Good news!
Finally he's sending her to us.
Thanks be to God, we're saved!
It's wonderful!
Calm down, Xaintrailles.
Who's done what?
The Dauphin is sending us
supplies and an army,
led by Jeanne,
the Maiden from Lorraine.
Isn't it wonderful?
Yes, it's a miracle.
They're sending a woman!
What colour dress will she wear?
Blue.
With a ribbon to tie up Talbot.
Does she even know how to ride
a horse?
She knows.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Yes, they were.
Where are the English?
Everywhere. The food?
It's coming. I rode on ahead.
I have a message
for the English Captain.
- His name's Talbot.
- I know.
Can you take me to him?
He's on the other side of the river.
Who ordered
my being brought to this side?
My friend!
Good to see your ugly damn face again!
- La Hire, don't swear!
- Sorry, Jeanne.
Let me introduce the King's
half brother, Lord Dunois.
Will you show me to the other side?
Wait...
Go now if you want, but not with me!
You serve God,
but I serve my people,
who are starving!
I'm taking the food back to the city.
Calm down,
come with me to Orléans,
and I will welcome you.
Jesus Christ!
- The goddamn English will pay for this.
- They will.
So will you, if you go on swearing.
Welcome to my tavern.
Come on in.
La Hire,
Gilles, come and see!
The Tourelles are here...
Calm down!
You can't blame them.
- They've heard about you.
- There's nothing to hear.
Because I haven't done anything.
And why?
Because no one listens to me!
Why don't you join us.
We're about to discuss the campaign.
So from here, Talbot
has spread his forces
between these forts.
But our scouts saw some troops
deployed to this fort.
What about this huge pile?
That's the Tourelle.
They planned to attack from it,
but we destroyed the bridge.
I did!
It should keep them quiet for a while.
Now my hunch is:
The attack will come from St Loup.
And what does Jeanne think?
I don't think.
I leave that to God.
I'm nothing in all this,
I'm just a messenger.
So?
What is the message?
We give the English...
a last chance to go home
- in peace.
- If they refuse?
If they refuse...
we recross the river
and attack
here!
At the Tourelle.
That makes no sense!
The Tourelle is impregnable.
And if we are on the other side,
who will stop Talbot attacking
- from the north?
- God.
God! Why, of course!
We'd forgotten about him.
I feel great sorrow for you.
You laugh, but by tomorrow,
some of you will be dead.
We can't just attack the Tourelle
like that.
- It's a complicated matter.
- Why?
You only need to do what you're told.
What could be simpler?
I'm the drum on which
God is beating out his message.
So hard it's bursting my ears!
Jeanne, it's not easy for us,
for our pride,
to suddenly be usurped by...
with all due respect, by a...
by a girl.
So, that's it.
To you, I'm just...
a girl.
Put yourself in my shoes.
How would you feel?
Knowing what I know?
Enormous gratitude.
One hell of a girl!
I warned you!
I do love her
when her fire gets well and truly
- stoked.
- Me too.
Hello, my friends!
What a journey!
But we made it.
Let's have some fun.
Fine. Let's look like a man.
Stop it!
How dare you stop God's will!
He never said cut your hair!
How dare you tell me
what God tells me to do!
Since He won't cut it Himself,
let someone do it properly!
Raymond, bring the scissors.
Louis, fetch
the mirror.
Stop getting so angry.
- Calm down.
- I am calm!
But God is angry.
I need to send a letter.
Now!
Fine.
Message!
Sire, a message.
Go fuck yourself!
What did they say?
They will think about it.
Good.
But I don't think
they'll leave tomorrow.
I can't wait for tomorrow!
French blood is spilling!
Wake up!
Hurry!
They've started without me!
There's a battle to fight
and a war to be won!
Sound the retreat!
My banner!
Open the gate!
What happened?
- Who ordered the attack?
- God knows.
- Bad idea.
- Were the men confessed?
- Where are the priests?
- Left behind, to gain speed.
Dunois, was it your order?
Answer me!
- Later.
- Sooner is better than later.
Wait!
You'll be killed!
Follow me
and I will give you victory!
Close it!
Close the drawbridge!
To the drawbridge!
What is she doing?
To the drawbridge!
- It's closed!
- Not for long.
Let's go!
That's mine!
It's a great victory, Jeanne.
Your victory.
But we must
pursue the English
back to Talbot's camp.
Unless you have a better idea.
We find the biggest army we can
and return
- to Orléans.
- The bridge was pulled down.
The English are rebuilding it.
How do you know?
You've been with your council,
I've been with mine.
Come on, hurry up!
Careful with my baby!
That's the Tourelle.
Wonderful!
Captain!
The froggie whore's paying us a visit.
I'd better tell Glasdale.
Put the horses there!
Fathers,
please bless them.
Bless them all.
Let's plan this attack more carefully.
Good idea.
Sire.
We've got... visitors.
Glasdale!
Do you hear me?
You call me a "whore",
I feel pity for you, for your soul,
and the souls of your men.
Yield!
Yield now to the King of Heaven!
Or go back to your island!
And you, go back to your pigsty!
Man the walls.
This morning,
God gave us a great victory.
But it's nothing
compared to what He'll give us now.
I know you are all tired and hungry.
But I swear to you
that even if the English were hanging
from the clouds by their fingertips,
we will pull them down by nightfall!
Let all those who love me
follow me!
Follow me!
You were saying?
I'll go right.
I'll go left!
Come on!
Get that fucking thing moving!
You're beautiful!
But are you powerful?
- Xaintrailles, do something!
- What?
I don't care!
Fire!
Fire!
Fuck!
Too high.
Reload!
Get out of here!
