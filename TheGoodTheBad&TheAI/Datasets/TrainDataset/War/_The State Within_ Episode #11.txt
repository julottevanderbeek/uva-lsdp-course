- Ring me.
- Thank you, Mr Hanley. I´ll be in touch.
Good luck.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
- So, how was London?
- Fine.
Hammers lost 5-3,
but apart from that, pretty good.
Thank you.
- Have a good flight, sir.
- Thank you.
- So, when do we lose you?
- Ah. Soon as they can find my replacement.
Number 10
will make the announcement tomorrow.
- Until then, we keep it under wraps, okay?
- Mark.
Caroline, hi. How are you?
Good. This is my dad, Anthony.
Dad, Sir Mark Brydon.
- Mark. How do you do?
- Delighted to meet you.
My Counsellor for External Affairs,
Nicholas Brocklehurst.
- This is Anthony Hanley of Hanley International?
- Yes.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleasure.
And Caroline Hanley, of the...
The Lowenberg Institute
for Foreign Relations.
I read your paper on US policy
in Central Asia. It´s really interesting.
Thank you.
And you still haven´t confirmed Tuesday.
Dinner, erudite company, how could you refuse?
Well, you know Sally. Got it in my diary?
Sally, what´s going on that night?
Well, there´s a clash. You´re pencilled in
with the Daughters of the Revolution.
- In that case, I´ll be seeing you on Tuesday.
- Last call, flight BAQ...
- That´s you, Dad.
- I´m afraid I must dash.
- Lovely to meet you at last.
- Pleasure.
Last call for flight BAQ 113
to London Heathrow.
Sorry, I had to double check your booking
for the First Lady´s charity ball.
They want to issue a press release...
- Good morning, Mr Ambassador.
- Good morning, Tim.
This way.
I hope you enjoy the flight, sir.
- Please turn off the laptop, sir.
- Of course.
Today´s schedule.
The service kicks off at 11:00.
Lunch is at Armitage Headquarters.
You´re on after the Secretary of Defense.
I think you should know
that James Sinclair is in town.
The press have picked up on his campaign
against UK-US support of President Usman.
Political prisoners tortured in Tyrgyztan,
suppressión of opposition etc.
Take a look at this.
There´ve been several calls
about yours and Sinclair´s friendship.
Tell them we were good friends in the ´90s,
but in recent years our paths
have taken different directions.
Mr Sinclair rang yesterday
asking to speak to you.
Shit.
The Embassy is to have no contact
with him while he´s in Washington.
Yep.
- What the...
- What was that?
Shit!
Shit. It´s gonna come down.
It´s gonna come down.
Can you get over to the left?
What´s happening?
Mark, stay in the car.
Stay in the car. Mark!
Help me!
Help me! Help me!
Help!
Help me! Oh, please, help me!
Help me! Please!
My name´s Mark. I´m gonna help you.
What´s your name? What´s your name?
Please help me! Help me!
Look at me. Look at me.
All right, we´re gonna get you out of here.
- My leg is stuck.
- Mark, Get away from the car. Mark!
- Please help me!
- Pull it, pull it! Calm down.
- Please help me.
- I know it hurts.
- Just give me your hand.
- Mark, I can smell petrol.
- Mark, look, you´ve got to get away.
- Don´t leave me!
Get back, Mark, it´s gonna blow.
Get up, get up!
Mark, it´s the flight to London.
Styles.
What? Where?
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention, please.
It is my great pleasure
to welcome my predecessor here at Armitage,
and now our esteemed Secretary of Defense,
Lynne Warner.
There´s very little that can pry me
out of the Pentagon these days,
but it is with great pride
that I stand here today.
You, with me now!
Since this corporation
was founded in 1981,
it has steadfastly generated wealth
and jobs for the people of this country.
In the nine years that I was privileged
to steer this ship,
and now under the able captaincy of
Gordon Adair, profits have doubled annually.
Armitage has investments and holdings
in over 90 nations.
May she enjoy another 25 years
of glorious growth.
Thank you, Lynne.
Lynne Warner, Secretary of Defense.
An explosión brought down
a passenger plane. We could be under attack.
We are just getting reports of a plane crash
to the west of Washington, DC.
Phil! Phil, it´s for you.
Phil. Understood.
The Ambassador is on his way up.
Everybody next door now, please.
There were 262 passengers,
Emergency Services are reporting
no survivors.
There are nine reported fatalities
on the ground, 43 casualties.
Where´s the President?
At Camp David for the weekend.
He´s been taken to the bunker.
A Code Red has been issued.
The security agencies will be treating it
as an act of terror till proven otherwise.
Let´s see that the relatives of the
British victims are kept informed.
Let´s open a free 24-hour helpline.
Nasreen, make sure
- the UK broadcasting services get the number.
- Okay.
We´ll need volunteers to man it.
Anyone not essential to emergency procedure.
Thank you. The Prime Minister
will be contacting the President.
I will also be sending a message of sympathy
on behalf of the Embassy
for the terrible loss of US lives.
- Sally, could we organise a book of condolence?
- Okay.
At this stage we don´t know if the explosión
will remain an isolated event
so if anyone here wishes to be
with their families at this difficult time,
it´s absolutely fine to go home.
Please do let us know first.
Thank you. Let´s get to it.
What did the PM offer you?
- It´s not really the time, Phil.
- Foreign Secretary?
- There´s a by-election to win first.
- Any clue as to who your successor might be?
Politics will suit you.
I want tanks at the airport now.
With respect, Lynne, that´s pretty extreme.
We have enough personnel on the ground
without deploying hardware.
We are sending a message, sir.
In England, the army was out in force
at London´s Heathrow Airport
when British Intelligence intercepted a threat
to shoot down an aircraft using a Stinger missile.
Some passengers have been waiting
Have you had a good trip
over here, Mr Hanley?
I´ve had a good look at the paperwork.
It all seems fine to me.
As agreed, 100 triggers immediately,
the remaining 25 to follow.
Any luck with the rest of Hanley´s effects?
Listen, there´s something else
I need you to do.
No names, I´m gonna need to keep myself clean,
and the Ambassador doesn´t need to know.
You go ahead. I´ll catch you up.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I´m so sorry.
They hope to identify him by his effects.
I said I would like to see him, but...
Is there no one with you?
Caroline Hanley?
- Yeah.
- If you´d like to follow me, ma´am.
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, no.
- Sure?
- I´ll be fine. Thanks.
Thanks.
It´s been confirmed. There was a bomb.
Shit.
FBI and CIA are liaising with Ml6. They´ve
requested intel on all British passengers.
Caroline, I need you to take a look at these
items and see if you can identify them, okay?
Dad gave up smoking 10 years ago.
There´s an inscription inside.
"To my darling Anthony, happy anniversary,
your Kate. 19th August 1990."
Mum. She died the following March.
So you can confirm that these articles
did belong to Anthony Gerald Hanley?
Mmm.
My condolences, ma´am.
- Anthony?
- Mmm.
Come on, I´m gonna take you home.
Okay. Come on.
that the plane crash on the Washington
Beltway was caused by a bomb.
Since then, airports around the US
have been on heightened alert.
Many remain closed to air traffic.
It is not just the US that has been affected.
In London, England, the army was out
in force at Heathrow airport...
- How are you, Sir Mark?
- I´m fine, thanks.
- Kind of you to wait up.
- Can I get you anything?
No, thanks, Jennifer, you go off to bed.
I... I have some things to do.
Mrs Standish? Mark Brydon,
I´m the British Ambassador here in Washington.
I just wanted to say how sorry I was
to hear of your husband´s death.
Mrs Stevens, my name is Mark Brydon.
I´m so sorry again.
- Don´t fire! Don´t fire!
- Don´t fire! Don´t fire!
Cease fire, cease fire!
Medic! Medic!
What do you think you´re doing on the ground?
Medic! We need a medic over here now.
Hang on, mate. Hang on. Hang on.
We´re supposed to be training,
didn´t you know the rules?
Jesus!
You take a good look
because that is what happens to tossers
who don´t pay attention.
Now strip him. I said strip him!
Stand aside.
Toss him over.
In no way am I condoning the appalling
events of yesterday.
All I´m saying is that the stance
the UKand the US take internationally,
it can be interpreted by certain groups
as provocation.
Right, well, take Tyrgyztan,
where I was ambassador.
Since ´99, the UKand the US
have invested over 50 billion dollars,
and at the same time 10,000 political prisoners
have disappeared under President Usman´s rule.
Did you inform your government at the time
of suspected human rights abuse?
Of course, but every cable
I sent to London, nothing.
Deafening silence from the other end,
and that´s when I started to speak up.
You´re saying the UKgovernment deliberately
ignored your allegations?
Not only that, they hauled me home,
slapped my wrists,
and when that didn´t work,
they sacked me.
It´s this questionable support of corrupt regimes
that helps inflame the enemies of the West.
That was James Sinclair.
British Ambassador to Tyrgyztan, 1997 to 2001.
Now back to the news team for an update
on the terrorist attack.
Well, you´re looking well.
You missed me on the telly.
- Coffee, sir?
- I´m not staying, thank you.
We´re getting a good response to the campaign.
Americans across the political spectrum
- are questioning foreign policy.
- I can´t hear this, James.
Come on, can´t we at least discuss it?
We´ve got a lot of catching up to do.
I can´t even be seen with you.
Then why did you ask to meet me?
Stop calling the Embassy.
Don´t try and use our relationship
to further your cause.
This isn´t my cause. You know
bloody well what´s going on in Tyrgyztan...
This has to stop, all right?
For Christ´s sake.
This is for Azzam.
Why don´t you give it to him yourself?
I´m sure he´d like to get to know his godfather.
Tell him...
I wish circumstances were different.
He´s nine years old.
All he knows is people in his life disappear.
Just leave me alone.
Dulles Airport is scheduled
to reopen at 11:00.
The first of the relatives
arrive this afternoon.
The authorities are very jittery. One unclaimed
suitcase, they will shut down the entire system.
Has anyone claimed responsibility?
Islamic European Jihad,
but no serious contenders.
As far as we know, it could be
white supremacists, a lone nutter.
How´s this playing in the UK media?
It´s mostly leading with mutual grief
of two allied countries.
I´ve told Sally she should cancel
tonight´s reception.
Absolutely not, we go ahead.
Let´s put a release out. Show our resolve.
Something along the lines of, um...
"Yesterday´s tragedy will not distract us
from pursuing our international aims."
Please let´s avoid
the "spirit of the Blitz" cliché.
I´ll run it past you before I issue.
- Next.
- James Sinclair.
Do we need to draft a rebuttal denying the claims
he´s made about UK-US aid to Tyrgyztan,
and our support
for President Usman´s government?
Don´t give that windbag oxygen.
Phil´s right. No comment on his visit. Next.
Luke Gardner´s death row appeal
is before the Supreme Court this week.
We expect the ruling in
the next couple of days.
Jane Lavery, our new human rights liaison,
has gone down to Florida
There´s interest in this both sides of the pond.
Falklands hero on death row.
Thank you.
- Where´s Sam?
- Sorry?
My lawyer, Sam Levinson.
I wanted the opportunity
to talk to you alone, Mr Gardner.
My name is Jane Lavery,
I´m a vice-consul at the Embassy.
He told me.
- I´m on secondment from London.
- He told me.
I´m a Gemini. Did he tell you that?
We need to talk about your appeal.
The Supreme Court is ruling on whether
you received ineffective representation.
You´re wasting my time.
If you´re not prepared to talk to me,
you´re wasting mine.
Now, your previous counsel failed
to introduce evidence from witnesses
who claimed they saw you two miles
from the scene of the murder,
- fighting with a cab driver.
- I can´t remember a cab driver.
I can´t remember most of that year.
Well, if you can´t remember,
how do you know you didn´t kill those giris?
I´d know. I´ve had blood on my hands before.
The Foreign Office have
a strong anti-death penalty stance,
regardless of your innocence or guilt,
I´m here to inform you
that they have made official representation
to the Supreme Court.
- Heads or tails?
- What?
Heads or tails, choose.
Heads.
You´ve chosen to die by lethal injection.
Now, they say it takes four minutes to die,
but the doctor doesn´t pronounce for 15.
I bet you wished you´d picked
tails now, eh, Jane?
You tell me.
Death by electric chair.
You ever smelt burning flesh?
It stays in your nostrils for life.
But they say it´s quicker.
But do I really want that
to be my mum´s last memory of me?
Tricky call. I´m not some kind of freak show.
So you take your anti-death penalty stance
and you get me the fuck out of here,
all right, bitch?
- Come in.
- We have a problem.
Ah, could you excuse us a moment?
One of the British passengers on the plane,
Hassan Khan,
- MI6 have turned up a second identity.
- Which is?
Ibrahim Wahid.
Suspected of having links
to a Jihadi training camp
and the Islamist movement of Tyrgyztan.
- Tyrgyztan?
- It´s on the northern border of Afghanistan.
I know where it is.
National Security Advisor´s
in your office, ma´am.
Tyrgyztan?
They´re supposed to be our goddamn allies.
It´s tough enough keeping a lid on the Mid-East.
What, now we have a Central Asia dimensión?
According to MI6, President Usman claims
to have suppressed the militants.
- Christopher?
- We have our doubts, ma´am.
We´re paying that ingrate $100 million a year
to scratch his balls. Jesus!
Scramble F-16s from our bases there
and bomb the terrorists for him.
Show the asshole how it´s done.
Suspect bomber was a British national.
Any link to a militant group in Tyrgyztan
is unsubstantiated.
Give me strength.
I´m supposed to be standing shoulder
to shoulder with the Brit Ambassador
in our moment of loss.
It turns out it´s one of their home-grown
massacring our people?
Didn´t 7/7 teach them anything,
for Christ´s sake?
What should we tell the speech writers?
Oh, try, "lf Britain´s our friend,
who needs enemies?"
The hunt for the terrorist group
behind the bombing of flight 113
as intelligence sources released information
on their chief suspect.
Several news channels are reporting
links between Hassan Khan-Ibrahim Wahid
and militants in the hills of Tyrgyztan.
Also an Al-Qaeda group in North Pakistan.
Where the bloody hell are they
getting this stuff?
All right, I´m gonna need a complete dossier
on Khan-Wahid. Full background.
Home life, schooling, mosque,
overseas travel.
And see if you can find out from your guys
in MI6 exactly who these groups are.
What their aims are. We need
to sort out the facts from the fiction.
Someone´s leaked this
before we can prepare a proper response.
Sure.
Paul, has forensics turned up anything
on the bomb?
Debris indicates the explosives were in the hold.
They´re not certain what type or grade yet.
It´s looking that they were detonated
by an electronic signal from the passenger deck.
Mark, it´s Garcia.
Carl. Yes, of course.
Not at all. Goodbye, sir.
- We´re going to the West Wing.
- Invited or summoned?
In the Situations Room in five.
How the hell
did the bastard slip under your radar?
- Hassan Khan was a clean skin.
- His alias Ibrahim Wahid wasn´t.
There´s been a massive failure of intelligence
your side of the pond.
Warner is incendiary.
She´s in with the President right now.
Be warned. She´s talking UK flight embargoes,
visa restrictions.
The President´s not seriously
considering that?
Yes, Mark.
When Warner buried her only son
in Arlington Cemetery,
she bought this President the election.
The woman´s untouchable.
I´m doing what I can,
but, frankly, she´s only reflecting
the mood of the people.
Half the US citizens right now wouldn´t care
if we tore up our passports
and closed our borders.
If she lets this damage UK-US relations,
she´ll be doing the terrorists´ job for them.
For Christ´s sake, Mark, there are American
body parts on a beltway courtesy of a Brit Muslim.
You´ve tolerated these extremists too long.
Sure, we´re not gonna slash and burn England,
but the President has to be seen to do something.
What if I get the PM out here
in a gesture of solidarity?
Too soon. That´ll just expose him
to a tidal wave of public anger.
People are panicking.
The US could be facing
a new wave of suicide attacks.
If you don´t want hysteria,
stop leaking intel to the media.
It´s not the Agency.
I´ll talk to Warner, try to cool things down.
Statement will be issued at 3:00.
- I´ll call you by 2:00.
- I appreciate the heads up.
There were British body parts
on the beltway, too, Carl.
I know.
- If it´s not the Agency...
- The leak must be coming from the Pentagon.
Whatever Warner is up to
we have to nip it in the bud.
- Have we opened the book of condolence yet?
- No idea. Why?
If we haven´t, let´s get Sally to wait.
We´re under attack, right?
I say bring our boys home.
It´s us folks need defending.
The enemy´s right here, on our streets.
Hey, thank you, Jack, for that.
Sounds like you´re pretty angry out there.
Hi, why is it every time there´s
a terrorist scare I can´t buy bottled water?
Sam Levinson. No, no, no.
No, no. Come on, I can´t...
No, I told you before, I can´t even comment
on that until after the Supreme Court decisión.
Hello, I´m Matthew Weiss. I´m covering
Luke´s story with The Washington Press.
Jane Lavery, British Embassy.
I´m surprised the press are interested
in the Britain death row.
- You kidding? This guy could be me.
- I doubt it.
I´m serious, he´s in danger of getting fried
over a legal technicality.
- Have you checked in yet?
- Oh, no, I...
Let me take that. They´re gonna try and put you
in some kind of executive suite,
but the sound of the air-con
is gonna make you go crazy.
- I suggest room 18. Room 18 is very good.
- What room are you in?
- 19.
- I´ll sort myself out, thanks.
How did Luke´s case get so far?
- Have you met him?
- Yeah.
Two dead white teenage giris
in a crack house, a junky Brit,
no recall and a history of violence.
Even Luke´s original attorney
wanted him to plead guilty.
- He was a Falklands hero.
- Means shit here. Thanks.
What do you think of his chances
at the Supreme Court?
Well, the way I see it,
I think his challenge is pretty good.
You and I could be sipping champagne
by tomorrow night.
- Any luck with those enhancements?
- I´ll drop them off this afternoon.
- Be there.
- Will do.
Hey, guys.
Jesus!
Give me the tweezers. Thanks.
Bag this tooth.
- Hi.
- Thank you.
They´ve cleaned it out. There´s nothing there.
- Did you find them?
- They´re missing.
Yes.
I´ve got Azzam Sinclair on the phone.
He says it´s very important.
All right. Put him through.
Hi, Azzam, it´s Mark. Happy birthday.
You having a good day?
- Yeah. Thank you for my present.
- It´s a pleasure. How´s my favourite godson?
How many godsons have you got?
Just the one. Just you.
It´s okay. Dad´s pretty busy.
Are you coming over?
I´d like to meet you.
Promise?
I promise.
Good boy.
Ambassador, may I present Gordon Adair,
CEO of Armitage Corporation.
Gordon, glad you could make it.
The DTI wanted to thank you
for bailing out Durmant Gas.
Well, we got an excellent price.
Look, good on you for going forward with
this tonight. You´re setting a fine example.
Thank you.
Hi.
Ambassador, may I present Charles MacIntyre,
president of CMC Secure Operations.
Mr MacIntyre, the Ambassador.
- Colonel, congratulations on your CBE.
- Thank you.
Good to see you.
I thought you´d be tied up in Baghdad.
Oh, I spend most of my time
now flying a desk.
You come over for lunch,
I´ll show you the new office.
- I look forward to it.
- Sir.
Ambassador, the US Secretary of Defense,
Lynne Warner.
Madam Secretary.
Thank you for coming at such
a difficult time.
Our enemies wish to render us asunder, Mark.
Instead, they bind us closer.
In that spirit of friendship, Lynne,
it would be an honour if you would be
the first to sign our book of condolence.
The honour would be all mine.
- Secretary Warner!
- Madam Secretary, this way, please.
Just one moment...
Secretary Warner,
just this way, please.
- Thank you!
- Madame Secretary.
Thank you.
Secretary Warner and the Brit Ambassador
united in sorrow.
- Nice going, Brocklehurst.
- I don´t know what you´re referring to, sir.
But modesty compels me to admit,
it wasn´t my idea.
Mmm-hmm.
Mark´s going to be a tough act to follow.
Colonel, how´s business?
Still peddling guns for diamonds.
Private security is a growth industry,
Nicholas, ask the Chancellor.
We´re thinking of floating the company.
You should buy some shares.
Bolster that public sector pensión of yours.
Under Secretary, do you know Charles MacIntyre,
CMC Secure Ops?
Christopher Styles,
head of Defense Intelligence.
We´ve met. Good to see you again, Colonel.
- Thank you.
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Excuse me.
...pray silence for Sir Mark Brydon, KCMG,
Her Majesty´s Ambassador to Washington.
I´d like to thank you all very much
for coming here this evening.
These are frightening, uncertain times.
But it´s in adversity
we find our true friends.
And that´s why I´m especially pleased and
honoured to be able to welcome Lynne Warner,
Secretary of Defense
for the United States government.
May this gathering serve as a reminder
of the bonds that unite us today,
will unite us tomorrow and
shall never be broken.
Madam Secretary.
I thought long and hard
before coming tonight.
But yesterday´s events were a violent reminder
of the forces out there
who wish to sabotage
not only the US democratic way of life,
but also our economic and commercial
interests throughout the worid.
I stand here tonight...
...to give full warning to those
who wish to undermine us.
The people of America will not allow fear
to haunt their lives.
Wherever our rights and freedoms are threatened,
we will stop at nothing to defend ourselves.
The Governor of Virginia is rounding up all
British Muslims in his state and detaining them.
This is an illegal act, never mind
that it´s a breach of international law.
- It shows total disregard for basic human rights.
- That is for Congress to decide.
As I understand, the Governor of Virginia
is acting under the powers of the Patriot Act.
We don´t even know who´s behind the attack.
Pakistani fundamentalists,
Tyrgyztani Islamists, Saudi...
The bastard with his finger
on the button was British.
And from what I hear, they´re plenty more
queuing up right behind him.
Do you know how many British Muslims
there are in Virginia?
- It only takes one.
- At least 3,000.
Holidaymakers, students,
business travellers, visa holders.
You´re saying they´re all terrorist suspects?
- It´s an obscene act of racial discrimination.
- Obscene?
Ask the guys riding your subway
who´s being discriminated against
next time some wacko decides
to detonate himself.
I played along with your
little stunt out there, all right?
All that hot air about strong bonds
and unity.
But my son did not die in Afghanistan
so that our so-called allies
could blow themselves up
in our own backyard.
If Governor Norris believes that these suspects
are a threat to the security of his citizens,
he has my 100º/% support.
Virginia authorities aren´t being
very cooperative,
but it appears a rough estimate of 200 British
Muslims have been picked up across state.
They´re being moved to Fort Bird National Guard
Barracks, their passports are being confiscated.
- Give me the Governor´s number.
- He´s refusing to come to the phone.
Too busy declaring a state of emergency.
What the hell? You´ll wake the building.
- What are you playing at?
- What am I playing at?
You´re the one that´s puffed up
like a cobra.
Defense Intelligence, your department, leaked
intel that there was a Brit suicide bomber.
Do you have proof of that?
Don´t play that game, not with me.
We´re in meltdown.
You´ve got a xenophobic maniac
locking up British citizens.
Governor Norris has every right to protect
the people who put him in power.
You´re deliberately fuelling anger.
Now we´ve got a witch hunt.
You must know how dangerous that is.
Whatever your reasons,
they´d better be worth it.
Are you done now?
What do you want?
He didn´t do it. He didn´t do it.
He deserves better.
- Who?
- Gardner, who do you think?
- Jane.
- He didn´t do it, all right?
Hey. Hey, you know that guy?
Hey, buddy, don´t move.
- It could be construed as intimidation.
- Don´t blame me. I´m not responsible.
How come he´s so certain you´re innocent?
Could he be used as a witness?
Look, death row cases attract the crazies,
all right.
Look, I´m trying to help you.
You may know him.
He´s your age, heavyset, wired, scared.
... of Flight 113 took on
a new dimensión today...
Well, I don´t know the bastard, all right.
- The bomber of the Airbus was British...
- Time´s up.
Wait, wait! I was watching that!
Let me just watch it. Let me get...
- Open up!
- Just me have a look at it.
a terrorist with established connections
to groups close to Al-Qaeda.
Think you´re gonna escape me, man?
It´s not gonna happen.
... statement this morning,
Governor Norris stands by his belief
that the enforced detentions
are a necessary and correct response
to protect the security
of the state of Virginia.
It´s gonna be another beautiful day
in the Lovers´ state,
but not for the 200 British Muslims
held at Fort Bird.
The British citizens were arrested
yesterday after the revelation
that the Flight 113 bomber was a British
Muslim by the name of Hassan Khan.
Governor Norris ordered them
to be taken to Fort Bird
where they can be held for up
to seven days...
- Oh, God, we´re going to be arrested.
...while the authorities decide
whether to deport them or
bring criminal charges.
- There is chaos on the highways...
- We´ve got to get out of here.
Don´t worry. Don´t worry.
- Please, Shahid, I don´t want to get...
- Whoa, whoa!
- Stop, we´ll shoot!
- Stop the vehicle or we´ll shoot!
Stop!
Sir Mark Brydon, British Ambassador.
Nasreen Qureshi, Press Secretary.
The police made some calls.
They told friends they were frightened
they´d be rounded up.
They were trying to get to Maryland.
