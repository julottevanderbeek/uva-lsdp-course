What's this war in the heart of nature?
I remember my mother when she was dying.
I was afraid to touch the death
I seen in her.
I couldn't find nothing
beautiful or uplifting...
I heard people talk about immortality.
But I ain't seen it.
I wondered how it'd be when I died.
What it'd be like to know
that this breath now...
I just hope I can meet it
the same way she did...
Kids around here never fight.
Sometimes.
Sometimes when you see them playing.
- They always fight.
-
- Is she afraid of me?
- Little bit.
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.
- Why?
- 'Cause you look -
You look as an army.
- I look army, huh?
- Yes.
- Well, that don't matter.
It doesn't matter.
- Baby's tired.
- Yes.
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.
Hmm.
- Okay.
There you go.
Go, go, go, go. Go.
Go, go, go. Go!
Witt, patrol boat.
She's American.
What's it doing out here all alone?
You haven't changed at all,
have you, Witt?
You haven't learned a thing.
All a man has to do is leave it to you,
you put your head in the noose for him.
How many times you been AWOL?
You been in the army,
what, six years now?
Ain't it about time you smartened up
and stopped being such a punk recruit?
I mean, if you're ever gonna.
- We can't all be smart.
No, we can't.
That's a shame.
Look at you.
Truth is, you can't take
straight duty in my company.
You'll never be a real soldier.
Not in God's world.
This is C Company,
of which I'm first sergeant.
I run this outfit.
Now, Captain Staros, he's the C.O.,
but I'm the guy that runs it.
Nobody's gonna foul that up.
You're just another mouth for me to feed.
Normally you'd be court-martialed.
But I worked a deal for ya.
You oughta consider yourself lucky.
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.
I can take anything you dish out.
I'm twice the man you are.
In this world...
a man himself...
is nothin'.
And there ain't no world but this one.
You're wrong there, Top.
I seen another world.
Sometimes I think
it was just my imagination.
Well...
then you've seen things I never will.
We're living in a world
that's blowing itself to hell
as fast as everybody can arrange it.
In a situation like that, all a man can do
is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.
Look out for himself.
I might be the best friend you ever had.
You don't even know it.
He hates you worse than poison.
I never felt he hated me.
'Cause I don't hate him.
I love Charlie Company.
They're my people.
They call it “The Rock.”
Now, nobody wants this island.
The Japs just put an airfield there.
All the fighting's confined to this area.
As you can see,
this is their road to Australia...
and this is their way of controlling
the sea lanes to America.
Now, if we're gonna
stop the Japs' advance...
into the South Pacific,
we've got to do it right there.
The marines have done their job.
Now it's our turn.
Worked my ass off.
.
- I admire you, Colonel. I do.
- Thank you, sir.
Most men your age
would have retired by now.
It's okay.
We need general officers
with maturity and character like you.
We've got good sergeants.
We've got good lieutenant colonels.
But once a man gets those eagles -
ooh, he can't wait to get that star.
- Can he? He becomes a politician, right?
-  Uh-huh.
Goes along to get along.
So goddamn hard to stay upright.
You said it there, sir.
With the admiral watching,
which he will be.
There's always someone watching you.
Like a hawk.
Always someone
ready to jump in if you're not.
- Yes, sir. I do.
- Good.
'Cause we don't want our sons
or our grandsons...
fighting this war
- No, sir. We sure don't.
- Then you crush 'em without mercy.
You - You dig them out of the hills
and protect that airfield.
Yes, sir.
Do you wonder why - why did they -
Why did the Japs put an airfield there,
of all places?
I guess we don't know
the bigger picture though, do we?
If there is such a thing.
What do you think?
Well, sir, I never
asked myself that question.
Mmm.
You're a humble man.
Nobody wants that island, but you.
How much do you want it?
As much as I have to, sir.
All they sacrificed for me...
- You feel it?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Take topside to the signal bridge.
The closer you are to Caesar,
the greater the fear.
I just can't help how damn
scared I am, Sarge, all right?
I can't help it. I got -
You know, my stepdaddy took a block
and beat me when I was real little.
And I-I was scared.
And I used to run. I used to hide.
Hell, I slept in a chicken coop
a whole lot of nights.
And, uh -
I never thought it'd
get no worse than that.
But I'm living by the -
by the minute over here.
I'm counting the seconds.
- Yeah.
We 're gonna be landing soon.
There's gonna be air raids.
We're probably gonna die
before we get off the beach.
This place is -
it's like a big floating graveyard.
What's your name, kid?
I want to own
an automobile when I get out.
- What's your name?
Train.
The only things that are permanent is -
is dying and the Lord.
That's it.
That's all you got to worry about.
This war ain't -
This war ain't gonna be the end of me.
And it ain't gonna be
the end of you neither.
All's I know is them crew guys said
they didn't catch no air raid
the last time they made this run.
On the other hand, time before last,
they nearly got blew up.
- What do you want me to tell you?
- You're a big help, Tills.
Nothing. Tell me nothing.
Tell you something.
like a couple of fuckin'
ducks in these here boats.
- That's what.
-  I already know that.
Well, brood on it, Tills.
Brood on it.
- Ain't you watching the fun?
- Ain't interested.
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.
- Wouldn't be interested even if it wasn't.
Well, I'm on my way
to get me that pistol.
- Yeah? Well, have fun.
- Yeah, have fun.
You'll wish you had one
once we get ashore...
and run into
some of them samurai sabers.
Open this door!
Open this goddamn door!
Open the door!
I learned to deal
these cards before -
All right, ladies.
Is this a sewing circle or a card game?
- All right, jacks high, jack bet.
- Robert's got two jacks.
I never bargained for nothing like this
when I signed up for this man's army...
back in the Bronx before the war.
How was I supposed to know
there was gonna be a fuckin' war, huh?
Answer me that.
All I know is old Charlie Company's
always gettin' screwed. Always.
And I can tell you
whose fault it is too.
It's that captain of ours.
First he gets us stuck off on this boat,
clear away from our own outfit...
Then he gets us stuck way down -
Hello, Captain.
Read in your 201 file
you were an officer before the war.
'Cause of my wife.
I was in the Corps of Engineers.
Uh, w-we'd never been separated before.
Not even for a night.
I - I took it for four months...
and then I quit.
Just resigned.
Th-They - They sent me back to the States.
They told me I'd never get
another commission.
They said they'd, uh,
see to it I got drafted
and that I
for damn sure'd be in the infantry.
No, I don't blame them.
Why should I be afraid to die?
- I belong to you.
-
Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move!
If I go first, I'll wait for you there...
Put your helmet on.
Be with me now.
- Feeling the pressure, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
I like you, Captain.
And I just want you to know -
well, uh, we're in this thing together.
All right?
You keep pressing inland
till you reach the line.
- I'll catch up with you there.
- Yes, sir.
It's all yours, Captain. Gangway!
Gangway, there! Coming through!
Squad leaders! Both teams!
This way, son. This way.
Right here.
Stand by to go inside!
Our Father who art in heaven -
- And forgive us our debts
as We forgive our debtors.
- Okay.
For Thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory.
Your outfit's lucky.
Transports must've been spotted.
You're getting out of here
just ahead of time.
You're lucky.
Ho! Ho! Ho! Take a breath, mister!
You gotta breathe!
- Are you Charlie Company?
- Yeah.
We went in about a mile, sir.
There ain't nothing there.
Some oil drums, a burned-out spot.
There'd be nothing there for at least -
- About a week.
- About a week, sir.
But we didn't spot any casualties.
Uh, Japs must have hauled ass.
Couple of mortars hit the beach,
but most of the guys came in standing up.
Darnedest thing I ever did see, sir.
Oh, if they didn't know this beach
was deserted, what else don't they know?
Who are you
who live in all these many forms?
You too are the source
of all that's gonna be born.
-  Blankets.
- We need a medic now!
Maybe all men got one big soul...
Everyone looking
for salvation by himself...
We're going straight up that hill there.
We can't do that, Colonel.
Well, there's no way to outflank 'em.
Now, on the left there's a cliff
that falls straight down into the river.
The Japanese hold the jungle.
It has to be taken frontally.
What about water, sir?
Water's not getting up here.
My men are... passing out, sir.
Only time you worry about a soldier
is when he stops bitchin'.
We're all gonna attack abreast,
We've got to cross
those three folds of ground.
You see?
Once we get beyond that,
we gotta attack that hill.
Colonel says
there's no way to outflank it...
so we gotta take it head-on
by frontal assault.
- Whyte?
-
You see those grassy ridges
at the foot of that hill?
Yeah.
When you get to the end of that field...
all the ridges-.
I'm sure the Japs got something there
to protect the approaches.
Are you here?
Let me not betray you.
Let me not betray my men.
Eos Rotodoctolos -
Did you ever read Homer?
We read Homer at the Point.
In Greek.
What kind of
artillery support do we have, sir? Over.
Two batteries of 105s.
They won't make a dent
in that position. Over.
No, but it bucks the men up.
It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.
Okay, you guys. This is it.
- We're going down in groups of 10.
There's no point in going by in rushes.
We'll only make a better target stopped.
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale...
-
Let's go.
Sico, what's wrong with you?
I'm sick to my stomach.
Sico, you get up right now,
or  kick you so hard in the stomach...
- you're gonna be sick.
- I can't, Sergeant. I would if I could.
I'm - I'm sick.
- I'm sick.
- You ain't sick. Get up!
-
- What's the matter, Sico?
It's my stomach.
I'm in pain. I got cramps.
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.
- Come on. Get up.
- Leave him.
I need a volunteer to carry the B.A.R.
Drop your gear, Sico.
I'm taking you to the medics.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
Don't argue with me.
Good luck, Keck.
Plug that hole on your right.
- Maybe they pulled out.
- Mm-Mmm.
-
-
Hit dirt! Hit dirt!
Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.
Stretcher bearers!
Move it out! Move out!
Come on!
- Stretcher bearers, this way!
- Come on!
Go get that man!
We already got eight or nine down there.
We're not supposed to -
Don't argue with me!
I'm Captain Staros. Go get that man.
Jim, he's not the one
we should be thinking about.
Goddamn it, all of you!
Am I in command here or am I not?
Am I the captain or a goddamn private?
We got others that are hit bad, sir.
That was all I meant.
- I gave you an order, Private!
- Yes, sir!
Hello, First Sergeant.
Who we going after over here?
We think it's Jacques.
Jockey?
Well, shoot.
That's - That's - That's too bad.
Sir? Sir.
Sir, can I come back to the company
after we get Jockey back to the battalion?
- Sure.
- All right.
- And my rifle.
Get up, Nicky!
You're still alive!
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Magnificent, 5 taros! Magnificent.'
The finest thing these old eyes
have seen in a longtime!
Beautifully conceived!
Beautifully executed!
You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.
Young Whyte led beautifully.
Yes, sir. Over.
But sending in
your second too was brilliant.
Just brilliant! They might
well have carried the ridge with luck.
I don't think they were hurt too bad.
Blane led well too.
Now, how many emplacements did they locate?
Did they knock any out?
We oughta have those ridges
cleaned out by noon! Over.
Hello? Hello?
Staros, are you there?
Here, sir. Over.
I said, how many emplacements
did they locate?
Did they knock any out? Over.
Children.
I don't know, sir.
What the hell do you mean, you don't know?
How can you not know? Over!
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir.
I'm right here behind the swell.
Uh, you want me to stand up and wave? Over.
No, I can see where you are.
I want you to do something.
I want you to get up there
and see what the situation is.
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.
Now, goddamn it,
the admiral got up at dawn for this!
Come to life down there, Staros! Out!
Move up!
Hey, Keck!
Yeah.
- I know it.
We know you there, Yank.
Tojo eats shit!
No! Roosevelt eats shit!
I got him! I got him!
I killed a man.
Hey, Queen!
Queen, you there?
Worst thing you can do.
Queen! You see them Japs
leaving that left ridge?
I killed a man.
Nobody can touch me for it.
Well, get your fuckin' head up
and look around!
I'm serious!
I counted seven Japs
leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!
I got me one of'em!
- I think maybe they're pulling out!
Maybe somebody oughta
go tell the captain!
Well, you wanna be the one to do it?
You just stay put!
I'm ordering you!
-
-
Stay low.
- Go! Go! Go, go!
What do we do now?
We wait right here.
Maybe they'll
send us up some reinforcements.
To do what?
To capture some of these goddamn fucking
positions around here! What do you think?
You mean you really
want to go on with this?
I don't know.
No. No. Not no uphill charge, but...
if they send us up some reinforcements,
maybe we could, uh...
scout around
and locate these machine guns.
Anyway, it's better than
going back down through that.
- Somethings coming. They're coming.
Why - why didn't they come in force?
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.
- They're coming.
- Keck!
- Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus!
I blew my butt off!
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I blew my butt off!
- What a fucking recruit trick to pull!
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
I grabbed it by the pin!
You write my old lady. You tell her-
I want her to know I died like a man.
Nobody's gonna have to write your old lady.
You're gonna make it.
- Don't you bullshit me!
I got mud on my face.
Wipe it off.
Get it off. No!
- I'll write her. I promise.
Take my canteen.
There's still some water in there.
Maybe it's for the best.
I'm all messed up down there.
I can't-
I can't fuck no more.
Wha -
Where am I?
- Where am I?
You're gonna be all right.
Even if you die.
You didn't let your brother down.
Hey, if you hadn't thrown yourself against
that embankment, we'd have all been killed.
I'm gettin' cold.
I'm cold.
I'm freezing.
You gonna write his wife?
- Fuck, no.
I don't know his old lady.
That's the company commander's job.
That ain't mine. You out of your mind?
I ain't -
I ain't no good at writing no letters.
You told him you would.
I'll say anything to 'em
when they're like that.
- Somebody ought to do it.
- Well, then you write her. You write her.
What's wrong, Jim?
Aaah!
There's nothing
anybody can do for him.
He'll be dead before they can
ever get him back to a surgeon.
- Then I can't ask you to go out there.
- Well, maybe it's worth a try.
At least I could get
a syrette of morphine into him.
- Would it keep him quiet?
Not for long.
But I could give him two.
And I could maybe leave him
three or four for himself.
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?
That's what you are.
That's all there is for us.
That's us. That's us.
- I lost all 12. I lost all 12.
All 12 of 'em.
It's insanity up there.
I told 'em what to do. I showed 'em
where to go, and I gave 'em a push.
Come on! Somebody help!
- Sergeant, it's insane.
- I don't know who's in charge.
I don't know who's in charge!
But don't let him go!
All right.
Don't let him go!
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.
I'm outta of here.
All right. Move, feet, move.
Move, move, move.
Move! Move! I'm moving.
I'm moving. I'm moving now.
Please, don't touch.
Don't touch. Don't look at me.
Don't touch. Okay, I'm outta here.
- Come on. My feet are all right.
Somebody help me! Help me!
- How goes it, kid? You gotta be quiet!
I came to help you, Tella.
Okay, calm down.
Fuck you! I'm dying!
I'm dying, Sarge!
Okay. Well, goddamn it,
do it with less noise!
- Are you gonna get me out of here?
- I'm gonna take you back.
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on.
Put me down! Put me down!
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
Please, leave me alone.
Give me more. Give me more.
Give me more.
Give me more. Give me more.
Give me more.
- Okay.
- Give me more.
- Here, Tella.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
Bye, kid.
Well, f-fortunately, Jim, the fate
of the company doesn't depend on one man.
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing
through the glasses.
I want you to know I'm gonna
mention you in orders tomorrow.
I'm gonna recommend you
for the Silver Star.
- That's the most courageous thing -
- Captain.
Captain, if you say
one more word to thank me,
I'm gonna knock you
right in the teeth.
You mention me in your fuckin' orders,
and I'll resign my rating so fast...
and leave you here to run
this busted-up outfit by yourself.
You understand?
Property!
Whole fuckin' thing's about property.
What the hell's
the matter with you, Staros?
Those men should be
reinforced immediately!
What the hell are they doing?
I can see 'em through my glasses!
They're just lying there behind that ledge!
They should be up and out,
cleaning out those machine guns! Over.
I don't think you understand
what's going on down here, sir.
His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir.
It created quite an upset.
Fine, fine.
Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.
I have, uh, two squads to, uh -
First platoon I can send up, sir. Over.
What the hell do you mean,
two squads?
Goddamn you, Staros! When I say
reinforcements, goddamn it, I mean it!
You commit everybody you have there
and do it right now! Everybody!
Your first platoon too.
I see 'em lying down there
on their fat asses doing nothing.
You get a man to 'em right now
with orders to attack!
And you move 'em
by the flank to the ridge!
Then you get that second platoon -
you move 'em over to the hill!
Have 'em press the center.
Go straight up that goddamn hill!
You attack them right now!
Jesus Christ, Staros! Do I have to give you
a 10-cent lesson on infantry tactics...
while your men are
getting their asses shot off?
Colonel, I don't think that you fully
understand what is going on down here.
My company alone
cannot take that position, sir.
The Japs are too well dug in.
They've got too much firepower.
Colonel, there's a -
there's a bunker up there.
We can't see it, and it's -
it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.
I formally request to be given permission
for patrol reconnaissance around...
to the right of Hill 210
through the jungle.
I believe the entire position, sir, can be
outflanked with a maneuver there in force.
- No!
- It might save lives.
Goddamn it, I tell you no!
There will be no flanking move!
- Now listen to me, Staros.
- Damn!
You're not gonna take your men
around into the jungle...
to avoid a goddamn fight!
Now do you hear me, Staros?
I want you to attack.
I want you to attack right now
with every man at your disposal.
Now attack, Staros!
That's a direct order!
Come on!
Sir, I must tell you
that I refuse to obey your order.
-
-
This is not your fault, Jim.
He's ordering you to.
I again request permission for
patrol reconnaissance
around to the right in force.
The time, sir...
is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.
I've got two witnesses here
listening to what I've said.
I request that you do the same
with witnesses there. Over.
Staros, don't you pull this
guardhouse lawyer bullshit with me!
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer!
This is not a court of law!
This is a war! It's a goddamn battle!
Now, I want that frontal attack!
I repeat my order! Over!
Colonel, I refuse to take my men
up there in a frontal attack.
It's suicide, sir.
I've lived with these men, sir...
and I will not
order them all to their deaths.
Over.
This is a very important decision
you're making, Staros.
But if you feel that strongly,
maybe you have a reason.
- So I'm coming down there.
- Take a look.
Now, I'm not rescinding
my order to you, son.
But if I find there are extenuating
circumstances when I get down there...
I'm gonna take that into account.
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it,
I want you to hold on until I get there!
And if possible, you get those men
on the ridge out and moving! Out.
One spot's as good as another, men.
There's no place to hide.
Um, um-
just take it easy, son.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.
Hold my hand, Fife.
Hold my hand.
I got it.
Oh.
I'm dying, Fife.
Oh, Captain.
Shut up in a tomb.
Get that blouse on, soldier!
It's not a goddamn bathing beach.
Yeah, right here.
Put it on right now.
What are you aiming at, son?
Let's go get those son of a bitches!
What are you doing laying down there
where you can't see a damn thing?
Observing, sir.
Just sent 1st platoon
forward to the ridge, sir.
- How many of ' em were hit this time?
- Uh, none, sir.
None? Not one?
That doesn't sound much like the situation
you described to me over the sound power.
Well, it's not, sir.
The situation's changed, sir,
just in the last five minutes, sir.
Captain, you listen to me.
Now, we're going over there,
and we're taking everybody with us.
Now, do you have any more
formal complaints or demurrers?
- No, sir. Not now.
- All right, goddamn it!
We're gonna do things my way! My way!
You understand that, Captain?
We're taking everybody over to that ledge!
We may take that ridge by nightfall!
I think the ridge is quite a way
from being reduced, sir.
Show me how to see things
the way you do.
Show me how to see things
the way you do.
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.
Bell, take six men...
and go see what's up there.
And we'll cover you
best we can from down here.
Okay. You guys - You guys stay here.
Okay?
I'm goin' up alone.
Come out.
There was a - a -
There's a bunker up there.
It's five guns. It's five guns.
That strongpoint up there -
somewhere up there around those rocks -
is the key to this ridge.
Bell here is quite right.
From their knob up there,
those goddamn little brown brothers...
can cover the whole of the ground in front
of this position for a thousand yards.
They've left this ledge unguarded.
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake.
That's a hell of a mistake.
We need to take advantage of it
before they see their error.
All right. All right,
I know you're all pretty exhausted.
And we've had a hell of a time
getting water up here.
For that I'm sorry.
I apologize to you all.
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow,
I think we can take this ridge.
So I'm asking for volunteers.
Go back up there and knock it out.
Sir?
I'll be glad to - to go back up
and lead the way back for a party.
- All right, Bell.
- I'll go, Colonel, sir.
And you. All right.
I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.
I'd like that very much, sir.
All right, John.
I was hoping you'd say that.
- Go ahead. You'll be in command.
- All right. I'll go, sir.
- All right, you.
- Sir.
You.
All right, men. That's enough.
Seven is plenty. Gather up.
I don't know if you realize
the importance of this operation, Staros.
Once our position is secured,
we can move the bombers in.
That means air power
for a thousand miles in every direction.
Guadalcanal may be
the turning point in the war.
It'll cost lives, Staros.
- Is that what's troubling you?
- No, sir.
Now, I explained to you
the importance of this objective.
How many men do you think it's worth?
How many lives?
I can't say, sir.
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives
of any of your men in this campaign?
How many?
Twenty?
Lives will be lost in
your company, Captain.
And if you don't have the stomach for it,
now is the time to let me know.
No, sir. You're right.
About everything you said.
Fine. Fine.
That's all, Captain.
One more thing, Staros.
It's not necessary for you to ever tell me
that you think I'm right.
Ever.
We'll assume it.
Dismissed.
I feel sorry for you, kid.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a little.
This army's gonna kill you.
If you were smart,
you'd take care of yourself.
There's nothing you can do
for anybody else.
Just running into a burning house
where nobody can be saved.
What difference you think you can make?
One single man in all this madness.
There's not some other world out there
where everything's gonna be okay.
Go ahead. Come on.
Look at me.
I stand right up here and not one bullet!
Not one shot!
Why?
How come they all had to die?
I can stand right here.
I can stand right up,
and nothing happens to me!
We.
I drink you.
You're my light.
John, we'll be right behind you.
If you can break through,
we'll come pouring after.
We'll charge at your whistle signal.
All right, let's go, men.
Go get 'em.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Okay.
Stay down, below this ledge...
and I'll call down the data
from above.
Once the 81s have plastered that rock
as much as possible...
we're gonna crawl along
the big rock for cover...
Okay?
Okay. Okay.
Azimuth 1-4-7-0...
from Easy Roger Seven.
Azimuth 1-4-7-O
from Easy Roger Seven.
Left 100. Add 200.
Machine gun.
Will adjust. Over.
Understand.
Left 25, drop 50.
Left 25, Uncle Baker One.
Left 25, drop 50.
Fire for effect. Over.
Roger, Uncle Baker One. 1-4-7 -
Let's go!
Okay, we're gonna continue on
up the hill to the right.
Nobody fire or throw their grenades
till I give the signal.
- What do you want to do now, sir?
- No, we can't leave him here!
Shut up. He's from your platoon.
You stay with him.
We can leave him and pick him up
on the way back if he's still alive.
- Not yet.
Dale, stay with him!
Cover our flank! Move!
We're pinned down!
Fall back!
Go!
Look out!
Watch out!
Clear!
- Come on! Get down!
Come on. Get out of there.
Come on.
Want to kill soldiers, huh?
Huh?
Huh, you piece of shit? Huh?
Son of a bitch!
You all right?
I shot a man.
Stinks around here.
All these dead people.
Put a cigarette up your nose.
Look at 'em move!
Look at 'em move!
We got 'em on the run!
Way to go, John!
When they saw you make that attack and win,
it was like you'd put
their hearts right back in 'em.
- Hey! Hey!
- Don't do that, soldier!
Take good care of the others, men.
G-2 will want them.
There'll be somebody around
before long.
I think we've wasted enough time here.
Let's go!
Sir, I've got a few recommendations
for decorations I'd like to turn in to you.
Yes, yes, John. We're gonna get everything
for all of 'em that we can, but later.
In the meantime,
I want you to know that I'm personally
recommending you for something, John.
Perhaps the big one.
Thank you, sir,
but I don't feel I deserve it.
Oh, yes, you do, John.
Yes, you do.
Getting it for you, now,
that's gonna be the goddamn problem.
But, hell, it would just be a
big thing for the battalion
and the regiment too
if you did get it.
Now, we better
get moving out of here.
We need to extend our lines, hook up with
the other companies and push on to the top.
Would you like to take command
of Baker Company over on the left?
Of course.
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket or
anything like that, but about the water -
- If we don't get some water to these -
- Don't worry about water.
John, I don't want anything to
break up this attack of ours,
now that we have the momentum.
We'll have some water
in a couple of hours.
I've arranged for that.
Now, we just can't stop now,
goddamn it, and wait for it.
No, sir.
That's right.
And if some of the men... pass out...
why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.
All right.
They could, uh -
You know they could die from it.
Well, they could die
from enemy fire too!
They're all tough boys.
Come on, men, let's go!
You'll see plenty more of those
where we're going!
Are we going up this hill
or aren't we?
John, I'm convinced that the Japanese
position can be broken right now.
All we have to do is keep going
and we'll have this hill.
We'll have this hill by sundown.
You see the spirit in these men?
Do you see the new spirit?
Well, I want to take advantage of that
before something happens
to sap their strength.
To have this battalion relieved
in - in a defeat...
or even to have it reinforced from troops
from the reserve regiment -
If we were to stall
before reaching the top, well -
Jesus Christ, that's just
a hell of a lot more than I could stand!
I've waited all my life for this.
I've worked, slaved, eaten, Oh, untold
buckets of shit to have this opportunity...
and I don't intend to give it up now.
You don't know what it feels like
to be passed over.
I mean, you're young.
Y-Y-Y-You're just out of the academy.
You know, you - you've got your war.
Fifteen years, this -
this is my first war!
John, someday you'll understand.
You're like a son to me, John.
You know what my son does?
He's a bait salesman.
You've done a hell of a job, John.
I'm gonna make sure that
you get everything -
everything that you deserve.
Thank you, sir.
God -
Goddamn it! I want three runners!
Get me three runners!
You go back to the rear
as far as you have to go to find water...
and get back here with it
as fast as you can!
- We attack in one hour!
We'll throw everything
we got at 'em!
We're going all the way!
Nothing's stopping us!
It's high ground by nightfall!
You seen many dead people?
Plenty.
Are you righteous?
Do you imagine your sufferings
will be less because you loved goodness?
Get down!
Get on the fucking ground!
Get down! Get down!
Get back!
Get on the fucking ground!
Now!
This great evil.
What seed,
what root did it grow from?
mocking us with the sight
of what we might have known?
Does it help the grass to grow,
the sun to shine?
- Is this darkness in you too?
Have you passed
through this night?
I'm gonna sink my teeth
into your liver.
You're dying.
See them birds up there?
Where you're going,
you're not coming back from.
What are you to me?
Have a seat here.
Staros, I'm relieving you
of your command.
Lieutenant Band
will take over for you.
It's a hard thing to do.
Difficult decision to make.
I don't think you're tough enough.
You're too soft.
You're just too soft-hearted.
You're not tough-fibered enough.
Anyway, it's - it's my decision to make,
and I've already made it.
I don't like to see my men
get killed, sir.
Have you ever had anyone
die in your arms, sir?
Have you?
I don't see any reason
to make a scandal out of this.
I don't want it in the records
of the battalion where I commanded...
and there's no reason for you
to have it on your records.
This has nothing to do
with cowardice or inefficiency.
Look at this jungle.
Look at those vines, the way they twine
around the trees, swallowing everything.
Nature's cruel, Staros.
I'm going to let you apply
for reassignment...
to the judge Advocate General's Corps
in Washington for reasons of ill health.
You're a lawyer.
You had malaria yet?
- No, I haven't.
- Doesn't matter.
I can fix that.
Anyway, you probably will have it.
I'm also recommending you
for the Silver Star...
and I'll recommend it in such a way
it definitely won't be refused.
Might as well have
the Purple Heart too.
Why?
Because of that scratch on your face...
and because of
those cuts on your hands.
Now, you listen to me, Staros.
I think it's best you go back right away
with the next batch of
wounded and prisoners.
It is no goddamn good for you
to keep hanging around.
The quieter we keep this,
the better it'll be for all.
This is from Colonel Tall.
“Our victory gives us
the highest reasons for pride.
"It will prove a milestone
in the battle for Guadalcanal.
“Tomorrow, the division
commander will arrive
"to make a personal inspection of the line.
“After the inspection, we're to be relieved
"by a battalion of the
division's reserve regiment.
I've secured for the battalion
a week's rest off the line.”
That's all.
Hours like months.
stood on the shores
of a new world.
I would've come by
and paid you guys a visit...
but, uh...
I just felt like being alone, you know.
Yeah?
We - We wanted to thank you, sir...
for asking to make
that flanking move...
for watching out for us...
keeping us together.
We're all sorry to see you go.
We feel like you got a rotten deal.
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.
not knowing
if you're doing any good.
That's the hard part.
But, uh, it doesn't matter.
I don't care. I'm -
I'm glad to be going.
I'm glad.
There's still time.
We could file a complaint.
For what?
What good would that do?
Eh?
Anyway, I want to go.
Leave it alone.
Let it lay.
What does that mean, sir?
It means,
“You've been like my sons.”
You
Push up.
You live inside me now.
Can't nothing make you forget it.
My dear wife.
You get something
twisted out of your insides...
I want to come back to you
the man I was before.
How do we get
to those other shores...
No matter how much training you got,
how careful you are...
it's a matter of luck
whether or not you get killed.
Makes no difference who you are
or how tough a guy you might be.
If you're in the wrong spot at
the wrong time, you're gonna get it.
I don't feel nothing.
I don't care about nothing anymore.
Sounds like bliss.
I don't have that feeling yet...
that numbness.
Not like the rest of you guys.
Maybe 'cause I knew what to expect.
Maybe I was just frozen up already.
I haven't touched another woman
since I was called up.
Or talked to one.
I don't want to -
I don't want to feel the desire.
All right. Abrahams!
Abrahams, here you go.
Stack! Where's Stack?
Bring him out. Here.
Another one for Bell.
Another one for Bell.
Dear jack...
I know you can say no,
but I'm asking you anyway...
out of the memory
of what we had together.
People who have been as close
as we've been always meet again.
I have no right
to speak to you this way.
Oh, my friend
of all those shining years...
What's your name?
We were a family.
so that now
we're turned against each other...
How did we lose the good
that was given us...
What's keeping us
from reaching out...
I'd have had you, Witt,
if you was a Jap...
long ago.
They leave you here?
Yep.
- I slowed 'em up.
Don't mind, really.
The medic,
he fixed me up pretty good.
I got plenty of ammo.
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.
- They got you good.
- Right in the knee.
Yeah.
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.
What are you doing down here?
Uh, just, you know-
I'm heading back to the company.
- Yeah.
Well, you give all them boys my best.
You can come with me if you want.
I'll help you along.
Nah, it's nice and quiet...
peaceful up here.
I'd just slow you up.
There'll be somebody along.
I'll remind 'em.
Okay.
Hey, Witt.
Who you making trouble for today?
What do you mean?
Well, isn't that what you like to do?
Turn left when they say go right?
Why are you
such a troublemaker, Witt?
You care about me,
don't you, Sergeant?
I always felt like you did.
Why do you always
make yourself out like a rock?
One day I can come up
and talk to you.
By the next day...
Lonely house now.
You ever get lonely?
Only around people.
Only around people.
You still believing
in the beautiful light, are you?
How do you do that?
You're a magician to me.
I still see a spark in you.
One man looks at a dying bird...
and thinks there's nothing
but unanswered pain.
We need to get out of here right now.
You explain to - to headquarters
the situation?
- No.
- Do they know where we are?
'Cause we're sitting ducks out here.
Well, I think that's up to me
to judge, Sergeant.
No, I think we just need to send somebody
up there and find out how close they are.
Okay? It's easy.
Hey, Weld, uh,
get headquarters on that thing.
The fire's coming closer, sir.
Line's cut.
This line?
Well, we need to send somebody out there
to find out where that line is being cut...
and we need to find out how
close they are.
Come on.
Uh, okay, okay.
Uh...
hey, you.
You go.
You're going, Fife.
Coombs.
You go too.
- I'll go.
But I want you to know I think
the whole thing's a bad idea though.
If they come down here
in any strength, Lieutenant...
they're gonna knock our position
to hell and flinders.
Well, you don't have to go, Private.
There's others who 'll volunteer.
No, I want to go, sir. In case
something bad happens, I want to be there.
All right.
Y-You stay by the river.
That jungle's too thick.
And be very careful.
I will.
Good luck, Witt.
You okay, Fife?
A reinforced battalion.
We need to go back,
tell the lieutenant.
Let's go.
-
- I'm hit!
-
Do it! Split up!
One of us needs to stay here
and hold 'em off.
We'll be all right.
My friend here doesn't have long.
So, you go.
You go on ahead.
Witt.
- Shh. Shh.
They're coming.
I gotta go.
I don't want you to be afraid.
Just hide out here till you hear firing.
Then push on down the river.
- Where's Coombs?
- Get back. Get back. They're coming!
Fall back.
Where's Witt?
Fife, where's Witt?
Fife, where's Witt?
America.
Where's your spark now?
Now, I know you men have been making
and drinking this goddamn swipe.
Everything a lie.
Any man in an outfit of mine can
get as drunk as he wants to every night.
Everything you hear, everything you see.
As long as he's ready and
in shape to make reveille
and carry out any assignment he is given.
If he can't do that,
he's gonna have trouble from me.
So much to spew out.
Now, I prefer to think of myself
as a family man...
and that's what we all are here,
whether we like it or not.
We are a family.
I'm the father.
Guess that makes
Sergeant Welsh here the mother.
They just keep coming, one after another.
that makes you all
the children in this family.
Now, a family can have only one head,
and that is the father.
Father's the head, mother runs it.
That's the way it's gonna work here.
If any of you men want to see me
about anything -
- anything at all...
A moving box.
You will find that I am available.
This war is not gonna be over
by next Christmas.
It's gonna be a long time
before we get home.
They want you dead...
Somethin' I can come back to.
Some kind of foundation.
I mean, I don't know what, you know -
what your plans are, but...
I'm determined now.
I've been through
the thick and thin of it.
You know, I may be young,
but I've lived plenty of life.
I'm ready to start living it good.
You know, my daddy always told me
it's gonna get a whole lot worse
before it gets better.
You know, 'cause life ain't supposed
to be that hard when you're young.
Well, I - I figure after this,
the worst is gonna be gone though.
It's time for things to get better.
That's what I want.
That's what's gonna happen.
I'm getting older now.
Where is it that we were together?
Darkness and light.
O my soul...
