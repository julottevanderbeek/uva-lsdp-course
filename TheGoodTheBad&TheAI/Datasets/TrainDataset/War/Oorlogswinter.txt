Brains.
SOLDlER: Hey!
You turn right!
Herr van Beusekom.
Herr Auer,
how are you?
Fine. Please sit down.
We found this boy
near the crashed plane.
l expect better manners
from a mayor's son.
You're right.
lt won't happen again.
Michiel?
Michiel !
He wasn't alone.
Who was the other boy?
Hmm?
He says he was
on his own.
Hmm.
You shouldn't
upset the Germans now.
l'm supposed
to suck up
to them too?

NAZl
Schafter.
Hey.
What's that?

Did you say anything?
No.
DlRK: Theo!
You have to help Dad.
l'm so glad
you're here.
You had to go?
Yes, raids for
the work camps.
How are you, Michiel?
Fine.
Can he sleep
in my room?
LlA: l don't know
if Uncle Ben wants to.
Can l put this
in the attic?
l'll do that.
FREE HOLLAND
How is school?
lt's closed.
NEWSCASTER:
...that this is indeed the
final offensive of the war.
"The war isn't over yet,"
he warned,
"but tonight
our soldiers have entered
the lair of the beast."
The law of the what?
The lair of the beast.
The lion's den.
The U.S. Air Force
and RAF have been,
as one official put it...
JOHAN: No,
l can't help you.
BEN: You know
where they are.
You can't
ask me that.
l bring a case of ration cards
and you want them
thrown in the river?
You let your own people
starve because you
have to be neutral !
Weakling.
Michiel?
Can you help me?
No time.
l have to go to Caesar.
Hi, Dirk.
Hi.
Can l have a word?
No time, he has
to go to Caesar.
Sucker.
Thanks for keeping
your mouth shut yesterday.
Did you get
in trouble?
No, not much.
Can you deliver this
if l'm not back tonight?
Why shouldn't
you be back?
lf l'm not,
take this letter
to Bertus van Gelder.
You can do that.
Not if it goes wrong.
What are you
going to do?
Swear not to tell
anyone. No one.
We're taking out
the ammunition depot
at Lagezande.
One, two. . .
Let's try it.
May l?
What is it?
Soup! Can't you taste it?
Watch out
or l'll shop you
to the Germans.
Michiel, come.
Come with your mother.
Left.
Turn.
Backwards.
LlA: Johan.
Dad !
Let me look.
Now it's my turn.
Why do they
want the neighbors?
You laugh with
the Germans.
Laugh?
Wasn't Dirk
here today?
Did he say anything?
No.
He took part
in a raid.
The Germans were
waiting for them.
Two dead and Dirk's
been arrested.
Michiel.
No.
No, he didn't
say anything.
What a fuss.
Theo's your best
friend, isn't he?
And do you know
his brother Dirk well?
lt was pretty tough,
wasn't it?
You know what will
happen to him now?
lf l notice you
getting involved in the war,
l'll knock your head off.
Clear?
Hey, Bertus.
Hi.
l have something for you.
Dirk Knopper came
yesterday. . .
Ah, Michiel.
Caesar needs a new
horseshoe, right front.
End of the afternoon.
Can't you do it earlier?
End of the afternoon.
Schafter was first.
THEO: Michiel !
You heard about Dirk?
He's been arrested?
l have to stay
with Grandma.
Mom thinks
it's too dangerous.
You're lucky with your dad.
They won't harm you.
Dagdaler Woods.
Old hunting cabin.
JACK:
Don't move. Don't move.
Who are you?
l'm good.
l'm a friend.
Put your hands up.
What are you doing here?
l'm a friend of Dirk.
Where is Dirk then?
He's been arrested.
Fuck!
Turn around.
Slowly.
Fucking Dirk!
You okay?
l'm here to help you.
l'm sure you are, Bertus.
Bertus?
l'm not Bertus.
You're not?
No, l'm Michiel.
Bertus is dead.
Oh, fuck!
l can help you.
Where did you get that?
The watch?
Found it.
By a plane.
Crashed at half past 1 2:00,
do you see?
He didn't jump.
Do you know how far it is
to Zwolle from here?
Yes, it's first
over the river,
then 35 kilometers
to Zwolle.
lt's very danger
to go over.
But l can help you.
l don't trust anybody.
You keep your mouth shut,
do you understand?
lf the Germans find me,
they'll kill you.
lf you talk,
l'll break your legs.
Have you got it?
When l come back,
l'll whistle this.
Hey.
ls there any chance of
getting some more food?
Not much left, you see.
Yeah.
Michiel.
l'm Jack.
JOHAN:
No, Bertus just ran away.
That was stupid.
BEN: lf you run,
they're allowed
to shoot you?
l mean he didn't
have a chance.
What shall we do?
We can't just
let this happen.
Who's in the
resistance here?
Not again, Ben.
l can't help.
You don't want to.
You'd rather talk
to Krauts.
l want everyone
to survive the war safe.
lf you know how, go ahead.
But not in my village.
"Your" village?
You have no power.
You proved that today.
Michiel.
Where did you come from?
Where did you get that?
Rule one in wartime:
keep your mouth shut.
Not hungry?
lt's German.
lt might be poisoned.
Uncle Ben.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, l'm fine.
Why do you want
to go to Zwolle?
l have a contact there.
He could help me
get back to England.
Maybe l can help you.
lf you talk
to anybody. . .
Yeah, you'll break my legs.
l know how
to go to Zwolle.
The Germans at the ferry
drink tea every day at 3:00.
So?
So, on the half hour
we go with the ferry
over the river.
An acquaintance
has to cross tomorrow.
l sail all day.
He has to cross at 3:00.
What do you have for me?
What do you mean?
As long as it's edible.
Okay.
See you tomorrow.
LlA: You can have more later.
That's Michiel,
our youngest.
Michiel, this is
Aunt Cora and. . .
Janneke. Janneke
from Amsterdam.
Will you cut some firewood?
Michiel.
Why do l always have to?
She never does. . .
l'm already busy.
You can do something.
Heil Hitler.
Michiel.
Give me a hand.
Hold that leg.
l've seen Grandpa do it.
But l'm making a mess.
Watch this.
Right.
Hang it for a few days
and we have a feast.
With grateful thanks
to the Nazis.
Meat is meat, Michiel.
Or would you rather
have soup again?
CORA: Jesus Christ
and God the father. . .
Great,
we lost our room.
l never heard
of Aunt Cora before.
But Hanneke?
Janneke.
Ah.
Jack.
You need help.
No.
l'll break your legs,
remember?
l bring my sister.
She's a sister.
A nurse?
Yes.
Hey! Michiel.
MlCHlEL: Erica.
Michiel,
now l want to know
where we're going.
To a patient.
Who?
l don't have time
for your games.
Michiel !
The less you know,
the better.
MAN: Well. . .
You're a long way
from home.
We ran out of wood.
Ow!
l'm going back.
Look for someone else!
ls there water
and a bowl here?
Hmm.
This is going to hurt.
Fuck!
l'm Jack, by the way.
l try not to hurt you.
Okay.
This needs rest.
That's really important.
Thank you.
Come on, let's go.
Michiel. Can l
ask you something?
lt's very important.
This has to go
back to England.
Do you know people
who can get it there?
Yeah.
lt's safe.
There's nothing in it
that can give me away.
Are you sure
you can do this?
Yes.
Of course.
Does Dad know
about this?
No, of course not!
But he has to know.
What if they find him?
They won't
if you keep quiet.
Michiel. . .
l take care of Jack
and you shut up.
More hot water?
Uh-uh.
What do you
want of me?
What are you up to?
Hey, what did l tell you?
You won't?
l didn't say that.
l'll take care of it.
What are you doing here?
Jack is my patient.
Jack is mine!
l'll take care of him.
You want him to die?
How is he?
The fever has dropped.
What are you
going to do?
None of your business.
lf l can help. . .
Get lost, that helps.
Come, hurry.
The ferry
leaves at 3:00.
What do you say
to someone in Dutch
when you really like them?
"Bastard."
"Bastard"?
Your sister is
a real "bastard."
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on !
Michiel, go now.
But l cannot. . .
Michiel, they mustn't
find us together.
Do you understand?
Now go. Go!
Michiel?
Are you okay?
Help set the table.
lt's Erica's turn.
You can help though.
How is Jack?
The woods are
full of Krauts!
ls he safe?
Where is Jack?
l lost him.
Van Beusekom speaking.
Yes.
Call me when
you know more.
They found
a dead soldier.
Where?
Dagdaler Woods.
A German?
Yes.
He'd been there
for some time. Shot.
Now they want
the culprit.
Michiel.
What do you know
about that dead German?
Nothing.
You will be careful?
lf there's anything
l can do. . .
There's nothing.
The package
is on its way.
You didn't whistle.
We'll go to Zwolle
when the Germans
leave the woods.
Tomorrow or maybe
the day after.
They found a German
in the woods. Dead.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Dirk promised
to bury the body.
Bastard.
lt was him or me.
What happened?
Hey.
Has he asked about me?
No.
What did you talk about?
Just things.
l'll help you.
Give me the razor.
Try it yourself.
Carefully.
Don't cut yourself.
Not too hard.
And hold it
at an angle.
We have to do it
differently.
Dad.
Look after yourself.
l have to know.
He's my husband !
Where's Uncle Ben?
There's no time to cry.
Do something !
They won't say
where he is.
Michiel, please.
We can't leave him.
Do something !
We don't know
where he is.
Vught, Amersfoort.
Prison in Deventer.
He's at the town hall.
Here?
ln the village?
Hmm.
Stay polite, Michiel.
That helps best.
Good morning.
l would like to
see my husband.
Van Beusekom.
l'm sorry.
l can't let you in.
l have brought
clothes and food.
Thank you.
l'll make sure. . .
l want to give it
to him myself.
Please.
l'm sorry. l really
can't let you in.
Stay there.
l have to
see my husband.
lmpossible.
He hasn't done
anything. He hasn't!
l know he hasn't
done anything.
Don't be so difficult!
Johan ! Johan !
All l ask is
to speak to him.
Johan !
Aha.
The mayor's son again.
l can't remember
inviting you.
Get lost!
Well?
Bomb the town hall.
Dad will like that.
Then we have to attack.
Come on !
What else?
We have to do something.
We can't just leave him !
l'll see what l can do.
l'll go with you.
No.
No. Stay with your mother.
Look after her.
Be careful.
Uncle Ben.
l'll do my best.
l promise.
Uncle Ben.
Mom, where is Erica?
Mom?
Erica!
What did you tell her?
They're going to
shoot my father.
What?
They're not.
They found a German
in the wood.
And now they will
kill my father.
No.
Dad will be free.
Uncle Ben will help.
ln English, please.
All on his own?
Who says he is alone?
Let's go home.
Mom is alone.
We go to Mother.
Come on then.
Looks like there's
no way around.
l'm gonna have to
turn myself in.
No.
That's not necessary.
lt's the only way
to save your father.
You'll get shot.
You'll die.
My best uncle, Uncle Ben,
he's helping.
He's with the underground.
He has contacts everywhere.
He make my father free.
He'll be freed tomorrow.
l did all l could.
Michiel?
Right turn !
Order arms.
Let go of me.
l know who did it.
Are you coming?
Michiel?
ls he coming too?
Of course.
Then l won't go.
Michiel.
lt's his fault.
Hey!
lt was the Germans.
Not Uncle Ben.
God save the Queen
Jesus.
That's for Jack.
He has to be
moved, Michiel.
l want to ask
Uncle Ben. . .
No.
Tomorrow he can
take the ferry at 3:00.
That's safe.
He has to go to Zwolle.
Sorry.
Michiel.
How's your father?
He's okay.
They let him free.
No, no, you stay.
Can we help maybe?
Claus, you take the left.
Push it under.
One, two and push !
Come on out.
You have to help!
He doesn't speak German.
Ah ! Schafter!
Give us a hand !
What's wrong
with the wheel?
No idea how to fit it.
Let me have a go.
Lower it slowly.
What time is it?
Wait a second.
Jack, come on,
we have to go.
Wait!
l decide when we go.
l told you to wait.
Jack.
Jack, come on,
we have to go.
Back, back!
Back!
Get Caesar!
Come on.
Faster!
Come on !
Jack. . .
Shh !
Hey.
Don't be so hard
on yourself.
They shot my father.
Oh, Christ.
l should have. . .
Germans shot him.
Not you.
Come.
Come on.
Sarah !
lnside, quick.
There.
Okay, you're
not here, okay?
You say nothing.
British military,
here in the shed?
A kid from the RAF?
He has to leave
as quickly as possible.
What's the plan?
Michiel?
Who's in charge?
Me.
You didn't involve
anyone else?
You don't know
what you're doing, do you?
From now on, throw snowballs
or bully girls.
l'll take over.
Erica, Jack's gone.
Michiel.
Your uncle is
taking me to Zwolle.
We'll walk to
the lJssel Bridge.
lJssel Bridge
is danger.
There are
checks everywhere.
Your uncle has
the papers.
l'm supposed
to be a patient.
They'll bring me
to the hospital.
"They"?
Ben and Erica.
Michiel. . .
What?
Piss off then !
lt's for you.
Open it when l'm gone.
Are you coming?
Bastard.
Hey. Here.
Thank you.
Ah, here you are.
Fortunately it's
nearly all over.
Dirk should never
have involved you.
See you later. Okay?
l never mentioned Dirk.
ln the Name of
the German People.
Hey, hey!
Michiel !
Bastard.
Michiel, put it down.
"Dirk should never
have involved you."
l never mentioned Dirk.
l didn't tell anyone.
He told me about the raid.
He was arrested.
He also talked about Bertus.
He was arrested, too.
Look, he works
for the Germans.
The Russians
will be here soon.
Then we'll see
who's occupier
and who's liberator.
Michiel.
Can l have
a cigarette?
Hey.
Where's that
resistance of yours?
Hey, Michiel.
Michiel, l want
to make a deal.
Let me go
and l'll leave Jack alone.
Oh, just like
Dirk and Bertus?
Terrible things
happen in all wars.
And Dad?
l had your father free.
Shut up!
Really.
l arranged it.
They'd take someone else
at random.
But your father refused.
lt was his choice.
Think about it, Michiel.
l'm a bastard,
but l'm your uncle.
l always protected you.
Your father
would've helped me.
Stand up.
Germans.
Mom !
Michiel !
Here you are.
Why don't you
go outside?
Why don't you
come to the party?
You want a go?
