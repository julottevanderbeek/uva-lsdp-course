Mr. Szpilman? Hello.
I came specially to meet you. I love your playing.
Who are you? My name's Dorota. I'm Jurek's sister.
You're bleeding! It's nothing.
Come on, Dorota. You can write him a fan letter later. This isn't the best time.
Jurek, where have you been hiding her?
I don't know what to take. You always take too much.
How many suitcases are you taking?
What do you think? Should I take Uncle Szymon's portrait?
Take it, don't take it. Take what you like.
Can't you see I'm worried sick? Oh, he'll come home. He'll be all right.
You have another case just like this. Mama, Wladek's home.
Oh, thank God! Wladek--
You're wounded? No, no, a little cut. It's nothing.
I've been worried sick. I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you. If you'd been hit by a bomb, they'd know where to take you.
Henryk, don't--
Don't say things like that. God forbid, God forbid. Papa, Wladek's home.
What did I tell you? What are you doing?
Anybody seen my hat with the wide brim?
They bombed us. We're off the air.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
Pack, darling. Get your things. Pack.
Where are we going? Out of Warsaw.
Out of Warsaw? Where? You haven't heard?
Heard what? Haven't you seen the paper?
No. Where's the paper?
I used it for packing.
She used it for packing! The government's moved to Lublin.
All able-bodied men must leave the city, set up a new line of defense.
There's hardly anybody left in this building, only the women. The men have gone.
What do you think you'll do while setting up your new line of defense?
Wander around lugging your suitcases?
Pack, Wladek. I'm not going anywhere.
Good. I'm not going anywhere either.
Don't be ridiculous. We've got to keep together.
Look, look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die in my own home. I'm staying put.
God forbid.
I've got something. Listen. Received from the BBC in London.
The British government, having received no reply...
to the ultimatums presented to the German government,
has declared war on Nazi Germany.
Ho-ho! That's wonderful, wonderful! It is expected--
Within the next few hours, France will make a similar declaration.
Poland is no longer alone.
Wonderful, wonderful!
Mama, that was a great dinner.
Yes, it certainly was.
When there's something to celebrate, you've got to make an effort.
Here's to Great Britain and France.
I told you. Didn't I tell you?
All will be well! Oh!
Five thousand and three.
Huh? Is that all? Yes!
-Five thousand and three zlotys. All we got left. -It's 3,003 zlotys too much.
Look. "Re:Further restrictions regarding liquid assets:
Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of 2,000 zlotys in their homes."
What are we supposed to do with the rest?
Deposit it in a bank. A blocked account.
Banks? Who'd be stupid enough to deposit money in a German bank?
We could hide the money. Look here. We can hide the money under the flowerpot.
No, we'll use tried-and-tested methods.
Know what we did in the last war? Eh?
We made a hole in the table leg, and hid the money in there.
- And suppose they take the table away? - What, take the table away?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and take what they want. Furniture, valuables, anything.
Idiot. What would they want with a table? A table like this?
What on earth are you doing? Listen. Look.
This is the best place. No one will think oflooking under the flowerpot.
No, no, no. Listen. I've been thinking.
Really? That's a change. You know what we do?
We use psychology. We use what?
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it, in full view.
- Are you stupid? - The Germans will search high and low. They'll never notice.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
Of course they'll notice it. Look here.
- Idiot. - And you call me stupid.
- That is very good. - This will take hours!
- We're not in a hurry. - It won't take hours.
How will you get them out? Tell me that!
- Pull each one out individually! - No one listens to me.
Quiet, please. Quiet! Order, order, please!
She's a lawyer, she likes order.
Just listen! The watch we put under the flowerpots and the money we stuff in the violin.
Will I still be able to play?
Well, you'll find out.
Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
How are you? Fine, fine. We're fine, thank you. And you?
Fine. We're fine in the circumstances.
I guess what you called about-- There's nothing we can do. They won't reopen the station.
Yes, I know. But,Jurek-- Not even music. Nothing. No radios for the Poles.
Jurek-- I'm sure you'll find work, a pianist like you.
Maybe, maybe not. But--
Listen, don't be offended, but I didn't call to discuss my future career.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks.
At last he gave in and said, "All right, come with me tomorrow."
So I came, and they bombed the station.
Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Really? Yes. It was-- It was unforgettable.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman. Call me Wladek, please.
No one plays Chopin like you. I hope that's a compliment.
Of course! I mean it. I know. I was just trying to be funny.
Shall we go to the Paradiso, have a coffee? I'd like that.
And you? What do you do? I finished at the conservatoire.
You're a musician! Yes.
What instrument-- I'm sorry. What instrument? The cello.
Oh. I love to see a woman playing the cello.
Here we are.
This is disgraceful! How dare they!
You know what people are like. They want to be better Nazis than Hitler.
I'm going in there to complain. No.
It's better not, believe me. It's so humiliating, someone like you.
We'll find somewhere else. We could walk in the park.
No, we can't. It's an official decree. No Jews allowed in the park.
My God, are you joking? I'm not joking.
I'd suggest we sit on the bench.
But it's another official decree. No Jews allowed on public benches.
This is absurd.
I'll tell you what we can do. We can just stand here and talk.
I think we're allowed to do that, don't you?
So you play the cello, Dorota. That's nice.
And who's your favorite composer? Chopin? Really?
You'll have to learn to play his cello sonata, won't you?
"And what about you, Wladek?"
Perhaps I can accompany you, me on the piano, you on the cello.
Mr. Szpilman, you are quite, quite wonderful.
Call me Wladek, please.
"Re: emblems for Jews in the Warsaw District.
"I hereby order that all Jews in the Warsaw District...
"will wear visible emblems when out of doors.
"This decree will come into force on the 1st of December, 1939,
"and applies to all Jews over 12 years of age.
"The emblem will be worn on the right sleeve...
"and will represent a blue Star of David on a white background.
"The background must be sufficiently large...
"for the star to measure eight centimeters from point to point.
"The width of the arms of the star must be one centimeter.
"Jews who do not respect this decree will be severely punished.
"Governor of Warsaw District,
Dr. Fischer."
I won't wear it. I won't wear it. I'm not going to be branded.
Let-- Let me see this.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves?
Where will we get them? We're not going to get them. We're not going to wear them.
Have you seen this? What? What? I'm working.
What?
What is it?
It's where they're going to put us.
What do you mean, "put us"?
"By order of the governor of the Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer,
"concerning the establishment of the Jewish District in Warsaw.
"There will be created a Jewish District in which all Jews...
living in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will have to reside."
Look here.
"Jews living outside of the prescribed area...
will have to move to the Jewish District by 31st of October, 1940."
They won't get all of us.
It's too small. There's 400,000 of us in Warsaw.
No. 360,000, so it'll be easy.
What am I supposed to do?
You tell me what I do now.
Mama?
Mama, what is it?
Twenty zlotys.
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?
I am sick of cooking potatoes, potatoes, potatoes.
That's the price. That's what I'm offering.
My advice is to accept. You won't get more from anyone else.
But it's a Bechstein, Mr. Lipa. 2,000... and my advice is to take it.
What are you gonna do when you're hungry, eat the piano?
Get out, you dirty bastard! What's the matter with you?
We'd rather give it away! Go on, get out! Haven't you eaten today?
What're you suffering from?
You people are crazy.
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand, and I'm paying for the removal.
I'm not even charging for the removal!
You haven't eaten today.
You're crazy. Take it.
Dorota.
Hi.
I didn't want to come.
I didn't want to see all this, but I-- I couldn't stop myself.
How are you doing? Fine.
Good.
No, not really. They arrested my cousin.
Jurek says they'll let him out.
This is disgraceful.
It won't last long. Don't worry.
That's what I said, it's so--
It's too absurd.
I, uh, I should--
Well, I'll-- I'll see you... soon.
Good-bye.
Well, to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.
Where will we sleep?
I'll sleep in the kitchen with the girls.
You, Henryk and Papa in here.
Look!
Come and look.
Go away, go away!
Papa? Papa?
Papa!
Papa.
Sell anything? Just one. Dostoyevsky, The Idiot. Three zlotys.
It's better than yesterday. Three lousy zlotys.
And there are people here making millions. I know.
You don't know, believe me.
They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye.
They're bringing in cartloads: food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.
And the poor are dying all around them, they don't give a damn.
Excuse me. Have you seen my husband, Izaak Szerman?
A tall, handsome man with a little gray beard.
No? Afraid not.
All right, excuse me.
Good-bye. Sleep well.
But, but if you see him, write to me. Yes? Izaak Szerman.
Why do we have to have a gentile street running through our area?
Why can't they go around?
Don't worry about it. They're about to build a bridge. Haven't you heard?
A bridge? A bridge? A shmidge.
The Germans claim to be intelligent.
You know what I think? I think they are totally stupid.
I have a family to feed.
I spend half my time here waiting for them to let us through.
Why do they think I come here? To listen to the music?
Come. Come. Dance!
Good, they're here.
Yitzchak Heller's been waiting for you.
What's this about? Sit down, have tea.
I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
So, what are you doing here? He brought cakes.
His father's back in the jewelry business. He's doing well, eh?
Amazing.Jewelry.
We're recruiting. Who's recruiting?
Don't be clever with me. I've come here as a friend.
They're bringing Jews in from all over the country.
Soon there'll be a half-million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police.
Oh! More Jewish police.
You mean you want me to beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Somebody's got to do it, Henryk. But why me?
I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers.
Look at my father. Look at us. I mean--
Yes, I'm looking! That's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life.
- You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books? - Yes, please.
I'm doing you people a favor. What about you, Wladek?
You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band.
They'd welcome you with open arms.Join us.
You've got no work. Thank you. I've got work.
Right. Yes, of course.
I'm sorry, Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Who wants me to stop?
I always say, look on the bright side! You're in the small ghetto.
Intellectuals, professional people. You're better off than us.
Here in the large ghetto, it's a cesspool. Jehuda, give me something to do.
You're an artist. You keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
But I want to help. I want to do something. You're too well-known.
And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators.
You're too... too... musical!
What was that?
Symche. Majorek.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
There are always notices going up. Hello, Symche.
Dolek. Mrs. Zyskind.
Jehuda, working hard?
Majorek, this is the greatest pianist in Poland, maybe the whole world.
Wladyslaw Szpilman. Meet Majorek.
I know your name.
I've never heard you play.
Majorek used to be in the army. Brilliant man.
The only thing I've got against him is he's not a socialist.
You better go now, Wladek. It's nearly curfew.
You know how many copies we print of our newspaper?
Five hundred.
You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.
That makes 10,000 readers.
These will start the uprising.
Majorek hides them in his underpants, and leaves them in toilets.
Toilets, huh?
As many toilets as I can find. Germans never use Jewish toilets.
They're too clean for them.
Please. Please, help, sir.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Come on, boy.
Stand up. Stand up! Stand up!
Stand up. Stand up.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about.
Enjoy our meal.
Fine. Then I'll tell you something funny. Do you all know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?
- The surgeon? - The surgeon. For some reason-- don't ask me why--
the Germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation.
On a Jew? They allowed a Pole to come in to operate on a Jew?
He got a pass. That's all I know. Anyway.
He puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation.
He's just made the first incision when the SS burst in,
shoot the patient on the table, then shoot Dr. Raszeja and everybody else who was there.
Isn't that a laugh?
The patient didn't feel a thing, he was anesthetized.
I said nothing bad, Henryk.
What's the matter with you all? Huh? Huh? You lost your sense of humor?
It's not funny.
You know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
What are you talking about my tie for? What does my tie have to do with anything?
I need this tie for my work. Your work?
- That's right, I work. - Yes. Playing the piano for the parasites in the ghetto.
- Parasites. - Boys. Boys!
- They don't give a damn about people suffering. - You blame me for their apathy.
I do. I see it every day. They don't even notice what's going on around them.
- I blame the Americans. - For what? For my tie?
American Jews, and there are lots of'em.
What have they done for us? What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat.
The Jewish bankers there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany.
Lights, lights!
You!
Up!
Shh, Mama.
What? Oh, my God. Shh.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me. I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
Yes, go in. Not you.
What's happened? What? God. It's terrible.
They're hunting people in the streets. They've taken Henryk.
Go home, all right? Go home.
I'll take care of it.
Excuse me. Have you seen my husband, Izaak Szerman?
I'm afraid not. He's tall, handsome, a little gray beard.
If you see him, write to me. Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.
What happened here?
They've got my grandson. They pick him up. They take him away.
What do they do to them? I've stopped believing in God.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Yitzchak?
Yitzchak.
Wladek Szpilman.
Henryk's in there. I haven't seen him.
Believe me, they've picked him up. Tough luck.
Can you help?
Ha! Now you need me. Yes, now you need me.
- Can you help us? - It costs.
I've no money.
Then there's nothing I can do. You should've joined us when you had the chance.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Who told you? People.
People I know. They said you're an important man.
Yitzchak?
Bandit! Boom! Boom! Kaput.
Kaput!
Zigarette? Mm. Danke schoen.
Help! Help!
A snatcher! A snatcher! Help! Help! A snatcher!
Why'd they pick you up? So you go to Yitzchak Heller.
Did I ask you to talk to him? You're out, aren't you?
Did you beg? Did you grovel to that piece of shit? No, I asked him to help you.
What did you pay him?
With what could I pay him? With what?
Every zloty I earn we spend on food. I can look after myself.
They were taking you away. It's got nothing to do with you!
It's me they wanted, not you.
Why do you have to interfere with other people's business?
You're mad. That's your trouble, is you're mad. That's also my business.
Hold it. What's the matter?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
Hungry.
Employment certificate?
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
You have to have an employment certificate...
to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise--
Otherwise, what? You will be deported.
So the rumors are true. They're going to resettle us.
Send us to labor camps in the East.
And they're closing the small ghetto.
My God.
Wladek? Wladek?
I thought you'd be off on tour playing London, Paris, New York, Chicago.
Not this week. You look terrible.
Have you heard the rumors? They're going to resettle us in the East.
Rumors! You take it all too much to heart. What's the trouble?
I've been trying to get the certificate of employment for my father.
I've managed to get one for me and the rest of my family.
But I need another one for my father. I've been to all the firms and shops.
Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business. I'm not, but Majorek is.
Can you help? I have no money.
Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him?
Be at the Schultz Workshop tomorrow, 4:00.
See what a wonderful piece of luck you've had today?
That's the historical imperative in action.
That's why I always say, look on the bright side. The bright side. Yes, I know.
How's your back?
Better. Better?
Better than last week.
Thank you.
My pleasure. It won't help you anyway!
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.
Well, at least we got work in the ghetto.
At least we're still together.
Du.
Du. Du.
Du.
Du.
Du.
I'm sorry. I did my best.
I thought the certificates would save us.
Stop it, Wladek!
Let's just hope that Henryk and Halina will be better off.
Where will we be going? You're going to work.
You'll be much better off than in this stinking ghetto. Move.
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it, huh?
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?
Don't you have a drop of water?
He's dying. My child's dying of thirst.
No. I'm sorry. I beg you. I beg you.
Don't you have a drop of water? I beg you.
Can you hear what I'm saying? I'm telling you it's a disgrace!
I can hear you! We let them take us to our death like sheep to the slaughter.
Not so loud. Why don't we attack them?
There's half a million of us here. We could break out of the ghetto.
At least we could die honorably, not as a stain on the face of history.
Why are you so sure they're sending us to our death? I'm not sure!
You know why I'm not sure? Because they didn't tell me. They're gonna wipe us all out.
What do you want me to do? Do you want me to fight? To fight you need organization--
He's right. What do you think I can do, fight them with my violin bow?
The Germans will never squander a huge labor force like this.
They're sending us to a labor camp. It's obvious.
Oh, sure! Look at that cripple there.
Look at the old people, the children. They're gonna work?
Look at you? You gonna carry iron girders on your back?
Henryk! Halina! Henryk!
Halina! Henryk!
We heard you were here.
We wanted to be with you.
We wanted to be with you.
Stupid, stupid.
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
She's getting on my nerves.
What did she do, for God's sake?
She smothered her baby.
They prepared a hiding place, so, of course, they went there.
But the baby cried just as the police came.
She smothered the cries with her hands.
The baby died.
Apoliceman heard the death rattle,
found where they were hiding.
Mama.
What are you reading?
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?
"If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
"If you poison us, do we not die?
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Very appropriate. Yes, that's why I brought it.
Idiot. What's he think he's going to do with the money?
Hey, boy?
Come here.
Come here.
How much for a caramel? Twenty zlotys.
What, for one caramel? What do you think you're going to do with the money?
Twenty zlotys.
Have we got 20 between us?
I got ten, I think.
Why?
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it? Why did I--
Halina? What?
It's a funny time to say this, but-- What?
I wish I knew you better.
Thank you.
Szpilman!
Szpilman.
Fuck off, stupid. Go!
Papa. Papa!
Papa!
Mama! Halina!
Halina! Mama!
What do you think you're doing, Szpilman?
I've saved your life! Now, get out! Just go. Go!
Don't run!
Mama! Mama!
Mama!
Well, off they go to the melting pot. Ja.
What are you doing? She's pregnant!
Left-Hut!
Forward!
Wladek!
Why are you here, Wladek?
It's like this, I-- I--
We--
All of them. All of them.
All of them.
Perhaps they are lucky. The quicker, the better.
It's not finished yet. We'll stay here for a couple of days...
until things die down.
I've bribed a policeman. He'll come when it's over.
My God. I haven't been outside in-- it must be two years.
Don't get overexcited.
Gold. A very good price.
Someone you know?
A beauty. Who is she?
She's a singer. I know her well, actually.
Her husband's an actor. They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her. Don't forget, they hang them for helping Jews.
Achtung!
How long have you been here?
Since last night.
I was pleased to see you.
They're going to start a final resettlement now.
We know what it means.
We sent someone out-- Zygmunt. A good man.
His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw.
He got to Sokolow.
A local railway man told him the tracks divided,
one branch leading to Treblinka.
He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw...
branched off to Treblinka and returned empty.
No transports of food are ever seen on that line.
And civilians... are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station.
They're exterminating us.
It won't take them long.
We're 60,000 left out ofhalf a million.
Mostly young people.
And this time we're gonna fight.
We're in good shape, organized.
We're prepared.
If you need help, I--
You! Come here!
Oh, Shit. Shit.
Sorry. I'm sorry. I-- I-- I don't know what I was thinking.
No. Please, don't. Please.
Please.
Und zig! Und zag! Und zig!
Und zag! Und zig! Und zag! Und zig!
Und zag! Und zig! Und zag! Und zig! Und zag!
Und zig! Und zag! Und zig! Und zag!
I hope you play the piano better than you carry bricks.
He won't last long if he goes on like this.
I'll see if I can get him something better.
Trouble.
Fall in! Only the Jews!
Poles go on working! Only the Jews!
I have good news for you.
There are rumors go around...
that we like to, uh-- Umsiedlung--
resettle you.
I promise you that now and in the future,
nothing else is plan-ned.
Ja?
For this reason,
we put information posters on the wall.
To show you our goodwill,
you should vote one of you...
to be allowed-ed to go in town daily...
and bring three kilos kartoffel--
potato, ja?
And one loaf of bread...
for each of your workers.
So, why should we do something else like this...
if we would resettle you?
You can make good business...
out of the things you don't eat.
Isn't that something where you Jews are good in?
Make money?
That one-- with the string.
The others are tied by wire.
Now.
Majorek.
I've a favor to ask.
I want to get out of here.
It's easy to get out.
It's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
I know. I know.
Last summer I worked for a day in Zelanzna Brama Square.
I saw someone I knew. She's an old friend.
A singer. Her husband's an actor.
I've written their names down and their address--
if they're still there.
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki.
They're good people.
Would you try and make contact?
They go to town. Would you just ask them?
Ask them if they'll help me get out of here.
Uh--
I, uh--
I tried your friends.
They don't live there anymore. But... you made contact?
Be ready to leave. When?
Soon. Halt!
Oh, shit. Shit.
- Und zig! Und zag!
Und zig! Und zag! Und zig! Und zag!
Und zig! Und zag! Und zig! Und zag!
- Nein.
Achtung! Marsch!
? Their ranks unite ?
? And follow the white eagle ?
? Stand up and fight ?
? Our mortal enemies ?
? Rifle, grenade ?
? Let's give them fire and brimstone ?
Now.
I'm sorry. I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.
We haven't much time. Come on.
- We must hurry.
Here. See if these fit.
Going to have to keep moving.
Germans are hunting down indiscriminately now.
Jews, non-Jews. Anybody. Everybody.
Oh, and, uh, Wladek, better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.
You'll be looked after by Marek Gebczynski.
He's on the other side of town.
You'll stay there tonight, then we'll find you somewhere else.
I'll bring you food.
All right. Let's go.
I'll show you where you're going to sleep.
You have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
We have a flat for you near the ghetto wall.
But it's safe.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'll be fine.
Thank you.
I'll take it. Yeah. Give it to me.
Go as near to the front as possible, to the German section.
I'm going to draw the curtains now.
But you leave them open during the daytime.
Don't forget.
Must feel better of this side of the wall, huh?
Yes.
But sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Some bread... potatoes, onions.
I will come again.
And Nina Bogucki will visit twice a week,
bring more food, see how you are.
Luck.
Oh. This is very important.
In case of emergency-- I mean, emergency--
go to this address.
Ohhh.
Ohhh.
Puppy-dog, what do you mean you forgot?
What do you think I mean, kitten. I forgot, that's what I mean.
You know what? You treat me like dirt.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pig. Pig!
Bitch! Dirty pig!
You are a dirty pig. Takes one to know one, pig!
Mmm. You play like an angel, kitten.
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
I was listening, kitten. Liar.
You fell asleep. Pig.
- Fire! - Fire!
Schiessen.
Thank you.
I wanted to come earlier, but-- No, no, no. Thank you.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
I never should have come out.
I should have stayed there and fought with them. Wladek, stop that.
It's over now.
Just be proud it happened.
My God, did they put up a fight.
Yes, well,
so did the Germans.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it.
Jews fighting back.
Who would've thought?
Well, what good did it do?
What good?
Wladek, I'm surprised at you.
They died with dignity, that's what good it did.
And you know something else?
Now the Poles will rise.
We're ready.
We'll fight too. You'll see?
Get your things together. You have to leave.
What? What's happened?
I'm on the run. Why? What's happened?
The gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.
They're bound to find out about this place too. You must get away at once.
Where do you want me to go?
Look at me.
I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
That's your decision.
But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out the window.
Don't let them get you alive.
I have poison on me. They won't get me alive either.
Open up.
Open the door at once or we'll call the police!
Are you from this flat? You're not registered.
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just came to visit, but I must have just missed him.
- Have you got your identity card? - Huh?
- Let me see your identity card! - Yes. Of course.
- I want to see your identity card! - What's happening?
He's a Jew! A Jew! Stop the Jew!
Don't let him out! Stop him!
Ohhh.
Yes?
Mr. Gebczynski sent me.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Dorota.
Oh. Come in.
I--
I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry. I was given this address.
I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
Come in.
Sit.
I need help.
He'll be back before curfew.
I've... been in hiding.
I need somewhere to stay.
He'll be here soon.
How long have you been married? Just over a year.
And how's Yurek?
Dead.
Oh.
Um--
And when-- when's your baby due?
Christmas.
This is not a good time to have children, but then--
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Oh, yes. I remember.
M-Mr. Gebczynski said to contact you only in case of emergency.
Uh, don't worry now.
We can't move you tonight. You'll sleep on the sofa.
Oh. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Could I have a piece of bread?
Y-Yes. Of course. We'll eat.
Sit. Please, sit.
Thank you.
You're in a very German area.
The building opposite is a hospital taking in wounded from the Russian front.
And next door is the Schutzpolizei.
Safest place to be.
Right at the heart of the lion's den.
I'll be locking you in.
No one knows you're here, so keep as quiet as possible.
All well?
Thank you.
This is Antek Szalas.
He will be looking after you.
How do you do? Thank you. Oh. How do you do?
I've given him a second key.
He'll bring you food, see that you're all right.
He's with the underground. He's a good man.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman. No. I don't think so.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician.
I saw you almost every day.
Sorry. I don't remember. I-- Doesn't matter.
You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
You'll be pleased to hear that the Allies are bombing Germany...
night after night after night.
Cologne. Hamburg. Berlin.
And the Russians are really giving them hell.
It's the beginning of the end. Oh. Let's hope so.
Still alive then?
Here. Sausage. Bread.
You've still got that vodka?
Mmm. How long is this meant to last?
Not long now.
I thi-- I think I've got jaundice.
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.
My grandfather was jilted by his girlfriend when he got jaundice.
Drink up.
Why-Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks. Problems.
Money.
I've got to raise money to buy the food.
I need things to sell.
It's not easy.
Here. Sell this.
Food's more important than time.
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you.
The Allies have landed in France.
The Russians will be here soon.
They'll beat the shit out of the Germans.
Any day now.
No, no, no.
Wladek?
Wladek.
I knew it. I knew this would happen.
I'll get a doctor. You can't. It's too dangerous.
I'll get Doctor Luczak. We can trust him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous. He's a pediatrician. He's still a doctor.
No. You stay. I'll go.
We came to say good-bye.
We're going to stay with my mother in Otwock.
The baby's already there. It's safer.
There's talk that the uprising will begin any day now.
That man Szalas should be shot.
He's been collecting money on your behalf all over Warsaw.
Apparently, people gave generously.
So he collected a tidy sum.
My God.
Liver the size of a football.
Acute inflammation of the gall bladder.
But he'll live.
I'll try to get him some levulose.
But it's not easy.
Can you visit him again? Who knows?
Doctor?
Doctor, thank you. Don't speak. Rest.
Thank you so much for coming.
We brought you some food.
I'll prepare something now for you.
Then we must go.
Get out! Get out, get out! Get out in the street.
Go on the street! Get out now, the Germans are surrounding the building!
No. No!
Someone. Somebody. Somebody help me!
Oh!
Hu-- What?
Ja.
Achtung!
Szpilman.
Szpilman.
German! German!
No, don't shoot! I am Polish.
Please! Ah! I'm Polish.
I-- Come out with your hands up.
Please. I beg of you.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, I beg you. I'm Polish. I'm Polish.
Come down!
Please. I'm Polish. Please.
Please. He's Polish.
Yes, he's Polish.
Why the fucking coat?
I'm cold.
Look at them. German fuckers!
Murderers! Murderers!
Dirty bastards!
Assassins! Bastards!
Look at you now. You took everything I had.
Me, a musician. You took my violin. Sons of bitches!
You took my soul.
Ja.
It was here. I'm certain of it.
Well, it's not here now.
I shouted abuse at them.
I'm not proud of it, but that's what I did.
And I'm certain I stood where you are now.
There was barbed wire, and this German came up to me.
- You didn't catch his name. - No.
I'll ask at the factory. They may know something.
