Narrator:THE DUELIST
DEMANDS SATISFACTION.
HONOR, FOR HIM, IS AN APPETITE.
THIS STORY IS ABOUT
AN ECCENTRIC KIND OF HUNGER.
IT IS A TRUE STORY,
AND BEGINS IN THE YEAR
THAT NAPOLEON BONAPARTE
BECAME RULER OF FRANCE.
AH! OH!
AHH!
GENTLEMEN,
GENERAL TREILLARD.
WHO KNOWS
LIEUTENANT FERAUD?
OF THE SEVENTH HUSSARS.
I DO, SIR.
YOU KNOW HIM WELL?
I'VE ONCE OR TWICE
COME ACROSS HIM, SIR.
THEN COME ACROSS HIM AGAIN
AND TELL HIM HE'S CONFINED
TO HIS QUARTERS
UNDER CLOSE ARREST.
LIEUTENANT FERAUD HAS
SKEWERED THE MAYOR'S NEPHEW
IN AN AFFAIR OF HONOR.
I HAVE SPENT
THE LAST TWO HOURS
APOLOGIZING TO THE MAYOR
ON HIS BEHALF.
COULD YOU CONVEY
TO LIEUTENANT FERAUD
HOW MUCH I SHOULD BE LIKELY
TO ENJOY THAT?
I HOPE SO, SIR.
I HOPE SO, TOO.
IN CASE HE FEELS
AN INTEREST,
THE MAYOR'S NEPHEW
IS STILL ALIVE.
MORE OR LESS.
TELL HIM I SHALL TAKE PLEASURE
IN SEEING HIM LATER.
I WANT SOME FOOD!
PERHAPS YOU COULD
ROUT OUT A CRUST.
I REGRET THE INTERRUPTION.
SIR.
IS LIEUTENANT FERAUD
AT HOME?
HE'S GONE OUT.
GONE OUT WHERE?
I DON'T KNOW.
MY DEAR,
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
HE WENT TO PAY A CALL.
PAY A CALL ON WHOM?
I'M SURE HE KEEPS
NOTHING FROM YOU.
MADAME DE LIONNE.
DID HE?
HE HAS AN ANGEL AT HOME
TO WATCH OVER HIS BREECHES
AND OFF HE GOES PAYING
A CALL ON MADAME DE LIONNE.
HE MUST BE QUITE BLIND.
THANK YOU.
?? AN ANGEL'S WING
BRINGS LOVE AND MUSIC ??
?? 'TIS THEN IN SPRING
WHEN LIGHT AND SUN ??
?? BEAMS WARM AND KIND ??
?? THAT AN ANGEL'S WING
BRINGS LOVE TO MIND ????
MADAME...
I MUST ASK YOU
TO PARDON THIS INTRUSION.
I'M HERE
ON MILITARY BUSINESS,
WHICH IS A LAMENTABLE REASON
FOR INVADING.
COME AGAIN THIS EVENING,
AND PLEAD YOUR FORGIVENESS.
YOU ARE MOST GRACIOUS.
MADAME, I HAVE ORDERS
FOR LIEUTENANT FERAUD.
PLEASE EXCUSE US.
I HAVE AN ORDER
TO CONVEY TO YOU
FROM GENERAL TREILLARD.
YOU ARE TO REPORT
IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR QUARTERS
AND REMAIN THERE
UNDER CLOSE ARREST.
What did you say?
I'm only a messenger.
That must be obvious to you.
I believe you heard
my message.
Yes, damn you.
An arrest for what?
Youdidfight a duel
this morning?
Of course.
You make dueling sound
like a pastime
in the Garden of Eden.
I think we ought
to leave now,
don't you agree?
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
WAS I TO LET
SOME SAUERKRAUT-EATER
WIPE HIS BOOTS ON THE UNIFORM
OF THE SEVENTH HUSSARS?
THE SAUERKRAUT-EATER'S
UNCLE HAPPENS TO BE
THE MAYOR OF STRASBOURG.
THE GENERAL WAS OBLIGED
TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS COMPLAINT.
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE
GRATEFUL TO YOU
FOR TAKING THE TROUBLE
TO FIND ME.
FRANKLY, I THINK
YOUOUGHTTO BE.
I HAD NO END OF TROUBLE
FINDING WHERE YOU WERE.
CALM YOURSELF.
CALM MYSELF?
I DO ADVOCATE IT
MOST EARNESTLY.
WOULD YOU LET HIM SPIT
UPON NAPOLEON BONAPARTE?
BONAPARTE HAS NO MORE
TO DO WITH THIS
THAN MADAME DE LIONNE.
DO YOU THINK THAT NAME
IS COMMON COIN
FOR THE STREET?
SIR, WHICHEVER NAME
YOU CHOOSE TO DEFEND,
IT IS WITH RESPECT
AND IN THE CAUSE OF LOGIC.
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
WHICH NAME!
WILL YOU LEAVE US
ALONE, PLEASE?
YOUR DUTY IS TO VICTIMIZE ME.
AM I MISTAKEN?!
YOU'VE CHOSEN
TO HUNT ME OUT
IN THE DRAWING ROOM OF A LADY
TOWARD WHOM I FEEL --
SIR, I RESPECT YOUR
INEXPRESSIBLE SENTIMENTS,
BUT THE HUNTING
WAS NO CHOICE OF MINE.
YOU HAVE INSULTED ME.
YOU HAVE INSULTED ME!
I HAVE STRAINED MY PATIENCE
IN ORDER NOT TO DO SO.
I DEMAND AN APOLOGY!
THIS IS TOO RIDICULOUS.
REALLY TOO RIDICULOUS?
A PROPER GENERAL'S POODLE.
CAN YOU FIGHT?
I SEE NO REASON TO FIGHT.
WHAT REASON WOULD YOU LIKE?
SHALL I SPIT IN YOUR FACE?
SHALL I CUT A CHUNK
OUT OF YOUR BACKSIDE?
OR WOULD THAT BE
TOO RIDICULOUS?
HOW DO YOU GET BACK
TO YOUR GENERAL NOW?
THROUGH THE WINDOW?
I BELIEVE YOU'RE REALLY
QUITE A MADMAN.
YOU DRAW YOUR SWORD.
YOU DRAW YOUR SWORD.
I'LL CHASE YOU DOWN THE STREET
LIKE A CHICKEN!
YOU WILL CHASE ME NOWHERE.
I WILL BE DELIGHTED TO FIGHT
YOU AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY.
YOU'LL FIGHT NOW.
I'M HERE ON DUTY,
AND YOU ARE UNDER ARREST
FOR DUELING, YOU APE!
NOW! YOU FIGHT NOW.
WHERE?
IN THE GARDEN.
WE HAVE NO SECONDS.
YOU WANT SECONDS?
I'LL FIND YOU SECONDS.
OLD MAN, STAND HERE.
AND WATCH ME.
AHH! AHH!
AHH!
ENTER.
YOU'VE BEEN SCRATCHED
BY A WOMAN.
CORRECT.
DID YOU COMMIT
A CRIME OF PASSION?
CERTAINLY NOT.
NO, NO, I AGREE.
THAT WOULD BE
OUT OF CHARACTER.
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?
I WOUNDED A MAN
IN A DUEL.
WHAT TYPE OF WOUND?
CUT ACROSS THE FOREARM.
NAME OF ADVERSARY?
GABRIEL FERAUD.
HE FOUGHT A DUEL
THIS MORNING!
MMM, HE ALSO FOUGHT A DUEL
THIS AFTERNOON.
AH.
I HAVE ANATOMIZED
THE MILITARY MAN.
I HAVE LITERALLY
PICKED THROUGH HIS BRAINS.
IT'S MY FATE TO GO ON
PUTTING HIM TOGETHER.
I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST
IDEA HOW HE WORKS.
WHERE DO I FIND THIS...
LIEUTENANT FERAUD.
WHAT WAS THE CAUSE
OF THE QUARREL?
ASKHIM.
AH, CAUSE OF QUARREL --
OBSCURE.
SO, WE PAY TO BE
MORE CIVILIZED.
A TOMCAT WOULD NEVER DREAM
OF SENDING A SURGEON
TO ANOTHER TOMCAT.
OH, YOU COULD TRY THIS
ON YOUR FACE.
HUH, YOU WERE
RECOMMENDED TO ME
AS A RELIABLE, INTELLIGENT,
YOUNG OFFICER.
YOU'RE A DAMN DISGRACE!
YOU LOOK A DAMN DISGRACE,
LIKE A DAMNED HOTTENTOT.
LOOK AT YOURSELF!
YOU WILL RETURN
TO YOUR REGIMENT AT ONCE.
I HAVE NO FURTHER USE
FOR YOU.
PENDING
A COURT OF INQUIRY,
YOU WILL BE CONFINED
TO BARRACKS.
I SHALL WELCOME THE INQUIRY.
YOUWILL,WILL YOU,
LIEUTENANT?
IF YOU EMERGE FROM IT
PURE AS DRIVEN SNOW,
YOU'LL REMAIN AN IMBECILE.
GET OUT!
THE WHOLE TOWN
IS BUZZING WITH IT.
I SPOKE WITH A DELIGHTFUL
OLD GENTLEMAN
WHO AFFECTED TO BELIEVE
IN THE TRANSMIGRATION
OF SOULS.
HE SUGGESTED YOU HAD
BOTH BEEN ENEMIES
IN A PREVIOUS INCARNATION.
HA.
WHAT DID FERAUD SUGGEST?
HE KEPT REMARKABLY QUIET
ABOUT IT.
MUCH LIKE YOURSELF.
WELL...
IT WILL ALL COME OUT
AT THE INQUIRY.
THERE WON'T BE ANY INQUIRY.
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED?
WAR.
YES. YES. WAR AGAIN.
YOU'LL BE A FREE MAN,
BACK WITH YOUR TROOP
IN THE MORNING.
GOOD.
I IMAGINED
YOU WOULD THINK SO.
SO I HAVE BROUGHT...
AHA!
TWO BOTTLES...
ONE CORKSCREW,
AND MY FLUTE.
FERAUD INTENDS TO KILL YOU.
IS THAT WHATHESAYS?
NOT TO ME,
BUT RUMOR GOES AROUND.
DAMN HIM ANYWAY!
HE'S MOST UNREASONABLE.
THE ENEMIES OF REASON
HAVE A CERTAIN BLIND LOOK.
HE HAS THAT LOOK,
DON'T YOU THINK?
WHAT CAN I DO?
I HAVE GIVEN IT
SOME THOUGHT.
UM...YOU CANNOT FIGHT, ONE,
IF YOU'RE IN DIFFERENT PLACES.
PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY.
TWO, IF YOU'RE, UH...
UPPED IN RANK.
IT'S A BREACH OF DISCIPLINE.
AND THREE,
IF THE STATE IS AT WAR.
DUELS OF NATIONS
TAKE ABSOLUTE PRECEDENCE.
THEREFORE,
KEEP AWAY FROM HIM,
KEEP AHEAD OF HIM,
PUT YOUR TRUST IN BONAPARTE.
HA HA HA HA!
THANK YOU.
BEFORE HISTORY
ROLLS OVER IT,
WHATWASTHE CAUSE
OF THE DUEL?
ARE YOU ASKING
ON BEHALF OF THE TOWN?
CALL IT A...
LIGHT CAVALRY SKIRMISH.
ALL IN ALL,
I'M FAR FROM CERTAIN MYSELF.
Narrator:AFTER SIX MONTHS
OF HARD CAMPAIGNING,
THERE FOLLOWED
AN INTERVAL OF PEACE.
HOLD HIM, GABRIEL.
ARE YOU HOLDING ONTO
TO THE TABLE?
NO.
RICHARD,
IS HE ON THE TABLE?
NO.
UNH! AH, GOT YOU.
LEFT ARM,
DOUBLE OR NOTHING.
HA HA HA, NO!
I ONLY BET RIGHT ARM.
ANOTHER?
YES.
WHERE'S YOUR BET?
TRUST ME.
NO, YOU MUST BE JOKING.
TRUST ME!
NO. COME ON.
YOU'RE NEXT.
ANY MORE BETS?
DAMN MUSCLE
NEVER HEALED PROPERLY.
YOU REMEMBER
THAT BOUDOIR SOLDIER
IN STRASBOURG?
THAT STAFF LACKEY?
YOU'LL ACT FOR ME,
WON'T YOU?
Woman: ARMAND!
ARMAND D'HUBERT!
LAURA.
HEY, MY BAGS.
LYLE TOLD ME
YOU'RE MARRIED.
MADAME, I AM ENTIRELY
AT YOUR SERVICE.
MY DEAR ARMAND,
HOW VERY GALLANT.
WHAT A RELIEF!
WELL, NOW THAT I'VE FOUND YOU,
IT WOULD BE AN ACT OF MERCY
IF YOU PUT US BOTH TO BED.
MARIE ROSE WENT BALD.
SHE CAUGHT THE MANGE
IN ITALY.
HOW DID JACQUES
RESPOND TO THAT?
NEVER SAW IT.
HE WAS KILLED AT MARENGO.
SIMONE MUST STILL BE
IN EGYPT.
AND ETIENNE MARRIED
THAT FAT GIRL OF HIS.
AND I HAVE RECEIVED
A TOKEN OF LOVE.
I FIND THAT
RATHER DAUNTING.
WITH THIS RING,
I RENOUNCE LOVE.
AND MAKE DO WITH YOU.
YOU WERE THE ONE
I ALWAYS WANTED.
YOU...YOU HUSSAR.
WHAT'S THIS?
I'LL HAVE THEM
DRIVEN IN DEEPER, SIR.
YOU'LL DO NO SUCH THING.
WHO THE DEVIL TAUGHT YOU
TO PICKET HORSES
SO NEAR A RIVER?
THERE'S GONNA BE WATER
AROUND THEIR KNEES IN TWO HOURS.
I WANT THE WHOLE LINE MOVED
TO HIGHER GROUND QUICKLY.
SIR.
LIEUTENANT D'HUBERT.
YES?
YOU'RE ACQUAINTED
WITH LIEUTENANT FERAUD?
YES.
MORNING.
MORNING.
ARE YOU READY, GENTLEMEN?
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
ALL RIGHT.
LA!
GENTLY. GENTLY.
JUST TAKE OFF
HIS CRAVAT, PLEASE.
EASY. EASY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
AND UNDO HIS BUTTON.
THEN WE'LL SEE.
EASY...CAREFUL.
JUST GET THIS...
CAREFUL. CAREFUL.
ARMAND,
IT WAS A FAIR SET-TO.
WON'T HURT YOUR REPUTATION,
I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT.
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE IT UP
LIKE A COUPLE
OF GOOD FELLOWS?
THERE'S NO NEED
TO BEAR HIM A GRUDGE.
HA HA HA.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SHAKE HANDS.
WELL?
HE CAN'T CONTINUE
I'M AFRAID.
IT'S QUITE BAD.
CAN HE CONTINUE?
NO, HE'S UNABLE TO.
DAMN IT.
GABRIEL, SHAKE HANDS
AND FORGET IT.
WHATEVER HE DID,
YOU'VE PAID HIM BACK NOW.
FROM ALL I HEAR,
HE'S A VERY DECENT FELLOW.
DECENT?
DON'T EXPECT DECENCY
FROM HIS KIND.
LOOK AT HIM LOLLING ABOUT
THERE ON THE GROUND.
ONE TOUCH AND HE'S OFF HOME
TO HIS BELOVED GENERAL.
NEXT TIME, D'HUBERT!
YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM
SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU.
I WAS FLAT ON MY BACK.
ONE CANNOT CONTROL
ONE'S AFFAIRS
FROM THAT POSITION?
YOU SHOULD HAVE GOT UP.
YOU WEREN'T DEAD.
I WASN'TWELL.
BESIDES, HE ONLY
WOULD HAVE STUCK ME AGAIN.
HE WAS WAITING
FOR THE CHANCE.
DO YOU MEAN YOU'D HAVE
GONE ON FIGHTING?
NO QUESTION.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE ONLY
HONORABLE THING TO DO.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
I'M GOING TO SNEEZE.
OH, NO, YOU MUSTN'T.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
COME ON,
THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE.
DESCRIBE HONOR.
HONOR?
HONOR.
HONOR IS...
COME ON. YOU MUST!
INDESCRIBABLE...
UNCHALLENGEABLE...
OHHH!
HMM, ALL THE LITTLE
GIRLS ADORE YOU.
WELL, YOU'RE A NOTORIOUS
AND SAVAGE DUELIST.
SAVAGE?
NOTORIOUSLY SAVAGE.
AND IT'S RUMORED THAT YOU
LIVE WITH A SAVAGE BITCH.
IT'S A SHAME
HE'S SUCH AN IDLE BRUTE.
ONE MORE DUEL --
AND GOD KNOWS
HE NEEDS THE EXERCISE --
ONE MORE DUEL
WOULD MAKE HIS REPUTATION.
YOUNG LADIES WOULD TAKE
TO THEIR SMELLING SALTS...
WHENEVER HE NARROWED HIS EYES.
NARROW YOUR EYES.
I THINK YOU'VE GOT
A LONG WAY TO GO.
WE COULD LEAVE BY THE BACK LANE.
WHAT FOR?
IF HE WANTS ME, HE'LL FIND ME.
YOU KNOW HIM?
YES.
Adele: SURELY THERE MUST BE
SOME OTHER WAY OUT?
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
ANYMORE.
THE ONLY WAY OUT
IS TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.
ONE HAS TO BE READY.
IT TAKES ALL ONE'S
ATTENTION TO BE READY.
WHERE IS
GABRIEL FERAUD?
Man: THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
YES?
GABRIEL FERAUD.
GABRIEL.
I LIVE WITH ARMAND D'HUBERT.
I KNEW A MAN WHO WAS STABBED
TO DEATH BY A WOMAN.
IT GAVE HIM THE SURPRISE
OF HIS LIFE.
I ONCE KNEW A WOMAN
WHO WAS BEATEN TO DEATH
BY A MAN.
I DON'T THINK
IT SURPRISEDHERAT ALL.
YOU'RE A SOLDIER'S LADY.
YOU SHOULD LIVE HERE
WITH ME.
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS
WHY YOU FIGHT WITH ARMAND.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET
BETWEEN THE PAIR OF YOU.
I BELIEVE IT'S A SECRET
OF YOUR VERY OWN.
I BELIEVE YOU FEED
YOUR SPITE ON HIM
WITH NO MORE SENSE
THAN A NASTY,
BLOODSUCKING LOUSE.
WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE
CARES WHAT YOU THINK?
NO ONE.
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?
CAME TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU.
LOOK.
DO YOU REMEMBER MARTIN?
GUNNERY SERGEANT
WHO LOST HIS ARM. YES.
HE'S OUT OF THE ARMY NOW.
HE WORKS IN THE ORDNANCE
FACTORY IN ROUEN.
I THINK HE WANTS
TO MARRY ME.
HE SENT ME THE RING.
WHAT RING?
THIS RING.
OH,THATRING.
MARRY HIM.
WHEN I'M READY.
I WAS TOLD I MIGHT FIND
LIEUTENANT D'HUBERT
AT THIS ADDRESS.
NOT HERE.
AHHH!
ON THE WATCH, SIR!
ALWAYS ON THE WATCH.
THEY DON'TALLFIGHT
LIKE FINE GENTLEMEN.
THE TWO OF SWORDS,
REVERSED.
STRIFE WITHOUT REASON.
QUARREL PURSUED
FOR ITS OWN SAKE.
DOES THIS SUGGEST
YOUR PROBLEM?
SEVEN OF CUPS.
WOULD SEEM THAT YOU MUST
MAKE A DIFFICULT CHOICE.
THE MOON.
THE MOON IS A SYMBOL
OF SOLITUDE.
HERE IS THE PATH
YOU MUST TAKE,
WHICH IS
THE PATH OF INSTINCT.
EVERYONE WHO TRAVELS
ON THAT PATH TRAVELS ALONE.
BETWEEN THE TWO DOGS.
DO I LEAVE THEM
BOTH BEHIND?
YOU MUST ANSWER
YOUR OWN QUESTIONS NOW.
YOU'RE ALONE.
AAAHHH!
AAAHHH!
SEPARATE.
GENTLY, GENTLY,
GENTLY, GENTLY.
Feraud: I'M NOT HURT!
Are they dying?
THE GENERAL
WILL SEE YOU NOW, SIR.
SIT DOWN
BEFORE YOUFALLDOWN.
YOUR COLONEL SPEAKS
HIGHLY OF YOU.
I'LL ADMIT I FOUND YOU
QUITE USEFUL MYSELF.
YET IN CONTACT
WITH THIS FERAUD,
YOU PERSISTENTLY BEHAVE
LIKE A WILD BEAST.
WHY IS THAT?
SIR, DO YOU WISH THAT WE
CONVENE A COURT OF INQUIRY?
NO TIME TO WASTE
ON THAT NOW.
SIR, AS A CRUCIAL POINT
OF HONOR,
I CANNOT SPEAK FREELY
ABOUT THE CONDUCT
OF LIEUTENANT FERAUD
UNLESS HE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO PUT HIS OWN CASE.
CLAPTRAP.
SIR, I CANNOT
FIGHT THE MAN THREE TIMES,
AND THEN TELL TALES ON HIM.
JUDGING
BY THE LOOK OF YOU,
A CHANGE OF TACTICS
IS WHAT YOU NEED.
VERY WELL.
CONVENTION ALLOWS YOU
TO BE A CHIVALROUS HALF-WIT,
BUT YOU WILL CEASE
BEING A QUARRELSOME HALF-WIT.
YOU WILL FIGHT NO MORE
DUELS UNDER MY COMMAND.
NOW, IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
YES, SIR.
SINCE YOU'RE NOW A CAPTAIN,
IT WOULD BE A GROSS BREACH
OF DISCIPLINE.
YOUR COLONEL CONSIDERS YOU
FIT TO COMMAND A TROOP.
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT
ITHINK YOU'RE FIT FOR,
BUT I WILL NOT OPPOSE
HIS DECISION.
IF YOU FEEL STRONG ENOUGH,
YOU MAY LEAVE NOW.
Narrator:FIVE YEARS PASSED.
THE MAP OF EUROPE CHANGED,
AND SO DID MILITARY FASHION.
NO.
ANOTHER TIME THEN.
BUY ME A DRINK, DARLING?
NEXT TIME.
YOU LOOK MUMPISH. CHEER UP.
I HAVE SOME NEWS TO TELL YOU.
SIT DOWN.
I HAVE NEWS TO TELL YOU.
THE 7th HUSSARS HAVE COME
TO LUBECK.
FERAUD IS BEHIND YOU.
I'M SORRY.
- CAN YOU MAKE OUT HIS RANK?
- CAPTAIN.
DAMN.
PERHAPS, FOR YOUR OWN SAKE,
YOU SHOULD FACE HIM NOW.
HOW CAN YOU AVOID IT?
HE'LL HUNT YOU OUT IN THE END.
KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.
THIS IS MY NEWS.
I'M BEING SECONDED TO
THE STAFF OF MARSHAL BERNADOTTE.
MY APPOINTMENT CARRIES
THE RANK OF MAJOR.
I'M TO REPORT FOR DUTY
IN A FORTNIGHT...
AND THE COLONEL HAS GRANTED ME
A FORTNIGHT'S LEAVE.
I WISH TO CONSULT YOU...
IN THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE...
UPON A FINE POINT OF HONOR.
GOOD-BYE, MAJOR.
DON'T I KNOW YOU WELL?
YOU DO.
YEAH, I DO KNOW HIM WELL.
D'HUBERT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ARMAND.
LAURA.
I COME TO LUBECK,
AND THE TOWN IS HUMMING
WITH YOUR NAME.
WHY WEREN'T YOU KILLED
AT ELSHINGHAM?
THAT WAS MY LAST NEWS OF YOU.
IT WAS A HARD DAY
FOR THE REGIMENT.
BUT NOTHING CURES A DUELIST.
HOW IS MARTIN?
MORE NEWS GONE ASTRAY.
HE DIED OF TYPHUS...
IN THE EPIDEMIC LAST JULY.
I'M VERY SORRY.
WERE YOU MARRIED?
I NEVER HEARD.
YES.
RIGHT AT THE END, POOR BOY...
FOR ALL THE GOOD IT DID.
A WIDOW'S WEEDS AREN'T MUCH HELP
TO A LADY OF THE GARRISON.
SO NOW I BEG...
AND STRIKE UP FRIENDSHIPS.
LAURA, GO BACK TO FRANCE.
THERE'S ONLY GRIEF TO BE GOT
FROM FOLLOWING SOLDIERS.
MARTIN SAID--
HE SAID,
"GO TO THAT FOOL ARMAND.
HE'LL TAKE YOU ON AGAIN."
THIS TIME, HE'LL KILL YOU!
WE THOUGHT ON HORSEBACK.
ON HORSEBACK?
AS A COMPLIMENT TO THE CAVALRY.
FERAUD HAS AGREED.
THE REGIMENT EXPECTS IT.
THE REGIMENT EXPECTS IT?
I SEE.
WE'RE NOW FIGHTING THIS DUEL
AS A COMPLIMENT TO THE CAVALRY.
ARMAND, LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU ARE A MAN OF REPUTATION.
A FAMOUS FIRE-EATER.
IT BRINGS YOU RESPONSIBILITIES.
YOU MUST THINK OF YOURSELF
AS FIGHTING ON PARADE.
FERAUD HAS BEEN BOASTING
ALL DAY...
BUT THE BETTING STILL HOLDS
AT EVEN MONEY.
I'M GOING
TO BE KILLED...
RESPONSIBLY ON HORSEBACK...
AS A COMPLIMENT TO THE CAVALRY.
THAT'S A USELESS SORT OF TALK.
GILLES...
I'M NOT FANATICAL ENOUGH
TO PERSEVERE IN THIS ABSURDITY.
IF HE SO EARNESTLY
DESIRES TO KILL ME,
HE WILL KILL ME.
DAMN IT, KILL HIM.
THAT'S ABSURD.
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.
THE COMBAT SHOULD BE
WELL ATTENDED.
I HEAR THAT LEBRUN
HAS GIVEN A BREAKFAST PARTY.
I HOPE THE WEATHER
IMPROVES FOR THEM.
DO YOU THINK SO?
LET ME TELL YOU MY IDEA.
Man: GENTLEMEN...
PREPARE TO ADVANCE!
CHARGE!
LA!
LA!
Man:
CAPTAIN FERAUD HAS TAKEN
A SLIGHT CUT
ACROSS THE FOREHEAD.
AND UNTIL THE BLOOD HAS STOPPED,
HE CAN'T SEE.
I REGRET THE DUEL
MUST BE DISCONTINUED.
Narrator:
FERAUD WAS POSTED TO SPAIN.
D'HUBERT REMAINED
IN NORTHERN EUROPE.
SIX YEARS LATER,
THE EMPEROR'S GRAND ARMY...
REGROUPED FOR ARMAGEDDON.
LISTEN, ALL OF YOU!
THAT WOODS STINKS WITH COSSACKS.
I WANT SOME VOLUNTEERS.
LISTEN!
VOLUNTEERS.
ALL OF YOU!
VOLUNTEERS.
I'LL COME WITH YOU.
PISTOLS NEXT TIME?
BY TOMORROW, WITH LUCK,
WE SHALL BE ACROSS THE NIEMEN.
I THINK WE CAN RISK
A LITTLE CELEBRATION.
SCHNAPPS?
DID YOU EVER SPEAK
TO NAPOLEON?
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I ONCE DELIVERED HIM
AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE.
DID HE SAY THANK YOU?
I SUPPOSE HE DID. I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS VERY NOISY AT THE TIME.
WAS IT RIGHT
TO SEND HIM TO ELBA?
WELL, HE COULDN'T SHARE A PALACE
WITH KING LOUIS, COULD HE?
WELL, WHY NOT?
Woman:
GILLES! HILAIRE!
GO ON.
DO WE HAVE TO GO?
HOW IS YOUR LEG TODAY?
PROGRESS IS SLOW.
COME.
SIT AND REST HERE.
I HAVE PLANS FOR YOU.
LEONIE, MY LIFE IS YOURS.
IT'S MY AMBITION TO BE KNOWN
AS THE OLD GENERAL
WHO LIVES WITH HIS SISTER.
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I FEARED.
IT IS THEREFORE MY AMBITION
TO SEE YOU MARRIED...
AS SOON AS IS DECENTLY POSSIBLE.
KEEP QUIET AND PAY ATTENTION.
THE HEIRESS FROM VALMASSIQUE--
THE ESTATE ACROSS THE RIVER--
IS A SWEET CHILD CALLED ADELE.
HER PARENTS ARE DEAD,
AND HER UNCLE
HAS BECOME THE DEAREST
FRIEND OF MINE.
IT WILL BE THE EASIEST THING
IN THE WORLD TO ARRANGE...
AND IT WILL SUIT YOU ADMIRABLY.
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING--
"SHE IS AN UGLY GIRL,
AND SHE WILL MAKE ME MISERABLE."
I ASSURE YOU, SHE IS FAR MORE
BEAUTIFUL THAN YOU DESERVE...
AND SHE WILL MAKE YOU
VERY HAPPY.
YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO SPEAK.
WHAT COLOR IS HER HAIR?
RAVEN-COLORED.
I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS
AT THIS TIME.
I AM LOOKING FOR
THE CHEVALIER DE RIVEROL.
GENERAL D'HUBERT, I BELIEVE.
I HAVE NOT HITHERTO
BEEN PRIVILEGED
TO MEET A GENERAL
OF BONAPARTE'S ARMY.
GENERAL OF BRIGADE, SIR.
AND ONLY RECENTLY PROMOTED.
A MERE IMP OF SATAN.
I CANNOT CLAIM
TO BE ONE OF HIS DEMONS.
YOU JEST WITH ME, SIR.
IN A NEIGHBORLY WAY.
LET ME MAKE YOU
A PAIR OF BOOTS.
IN A NEIGHBORLY WAY.
I WOULD ESTEEM IT AN HONOR.
GOOD BOOTS ARE NOT AN HONOR.
THEY'RE A PLEASURE.
ABOUT THE TIME YOU WERE LEARNING
TO BE A SOLDIER...
I WAS LEARNING TO MAKE BOOTS.
I'VE SUPPORTED MYSELF
AS A BOOTMAKER.
NOW THAT I'M AN ARISTOCRAT
ONCE MORE...
I HAVE TO DRUM UP TRADE.
SLOTH IS THE CURSE
OF THE ARISTOCRACY.
THE CHEVALIER FOUND YOU
VASTLY WELL READ...
AND HE SAID YOU HAD
A VERY GOOD LEG.
I SOUND LIKE A HORSE.
MY GOD, I'M LUCKY
HE DIDN'T LOOK AT MY TEETH.
I DO HATE THAT SWEARING.
DON'T YOU DARE DO IT
IN FRONT OF ADELE.
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
YES, YOU HAVE.
DON'T SULK. YOU HAVE.
ISN'T THIS MARRIAGE-BROKING
GETTING OUT OF FASHION?
NOTHING SENSIBLE
GOES OUT OF FASHION.
THEY'RE ALL COMING OVER TOMORROW
FROM VALMASSIQUE.
MEDDLE, MEDDLE, MEDDLE.
NONSENSE.
GENERAL D'HUBERT,
MADEMOISELLE DE VALMASSIQUE.
LET ME LOOK.
VERY HANDSOME FELLOW.
THEY HAVE GOLDEN EYES, YOU KNOW.
AND JEWELS INSIDE THEIR HEADS?
SO I BELIEVE.
WERE I A YOUNG MAN AGAIN...
RATHER THAN AN OLD,
LAME CREATURE...
I'D ASK YOU TO MARRY ME.
WELL, DON'T YOU WANT
TO MARRY ME NOW?
MY DEAR, WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT'S EXPECTED OF US, DON'T WE?
IF I WERE TO NEGLECT
TO MAKE YOU A PROPOSAL...
NO BLAME WOULD BE
ATTACHED TO YOU.
I THINK PERHAPS
YOU MIGHT BE SAVED FROM A...
SAD, DULL LIFE.
IF YOU NEGLECT
TO MAKE ME A PROPOSAL...
MY UNCLE WILL GO MAD.
DAMN IT, YOU WERE NOT PUT ON
THIS EARTH TO CODDLE YOUR UNCLE.
I HAVE HEARD YOU DO SWEAR
MOST TERRIBLY.
NONSENSE.
I'M A TEMPERED MAN.
TEMPERED IN MY SPEECH.
I LOVE YOU.
ADELE...
MY DEAREST ADELE...
IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY...
HAPPY BEYOND EXPECTATION
IF YOU WOULD BECOME MY WIFE.
YES.
IT WAS A FIASCO.
NONSENSE.
SHE ACCEPTED YOU.
WHAT ELSE COULD SHE DO?
NOTHING, I SHOULD HOPE.
IT WAS A PROPER,
SETTLED ARRANGEMENT.
OH, ARMAND...
IN MARRIAGE, EVENTS OF THAT KIND
ARE NOT IMPORTANT.
A GOOD MARRIAGE
SETTLES DOWN QUIETLY...
LIKE MOSS.
I'VE NEVER HEARD A BAD
WORD SPOKEN ABOUT MOSS.
MOSS?
LEONIE, AN UNKIND PLOT
HAS BEEN LAID AGAINST HER.
VERY WELL.
IF SHE'S GOOD AND BIDDABLE,
SHE'LL SETTLE DOWN.
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR.
SHE'S YOUNG.
SHE HAS THAT MAGIC.
YOU ARE IN LOVE?
YES, I'M IN LOVE.
WELL, THEN...
I CAN'T BE BOTHERED WITH YOU.
GO AND PLAY BILLIARDS.
NO CHEATING.
GO AND PLAY BILLIARDS.
SURELY YOU WILL NOT TURN DOWN
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BRIGADE.
THE EMPEROR IS OUR HOPE
AND STRENGTH.
WE BELONG TO HIM.
I HAVE ENTERTAINED
THE NOTION THAT...
I MAY BELONG TO MYSELF.
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT YOU
DO NOT LOVE THE EMPEROR.
BY WHOM?
BY GENERAL FERAUD.
HE KNOWS YOU WELL,
I BELIEVE.
GENERAL FERAUD HAS MADE
OCCASIONAL ATTEMPTS TO KILL ME.
THAT DOES NOT GIVE HIM THE RIGHT
TO CLAIM MY ACQUAINTANCE.
AND IT IS ALSO SAID
THAT HE FOUGHT YOU...
IN DEFENSE
OF THE EMPEROR'S HONOR.
THAT IS IMPERTINENT TRASH!
YOU HAVE MY ANSWER
TO MARSHALL GROUCHY.
I SHALL WRITE
TO CONFIRM IT AT ONCE.
GOOD DAY.
COLONEL, DO YOU SOMETIMES
MEET WITH GENERAL FERAUD?
NOW AND AGAIN.
ASK HIM WHAT THE HONOR
OF THE EMPEROR
HAS TO DO
WITH MADAME DE LIONNE?
MADAME DE LIONNE?
I THINK THAT WAS
THE LADY'S NAME.
HE SHOULD REMEMBER
BETTER THAN I.
TELL HIM TO DRIVE ON.
DAMN HIS IMPUDENCE.
THAT WAS
THE LADY'S NAME, SIR.
MADAME DE LIONNE.
YES.
GET YOUR BACKSIDE
OFF THAT TABLE.
FINE WOMAN. A CULTIVATED WOMAN.
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE EMPEROR.
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
THE GENERAL WAS SUGGESTING...
AN ILLICIT ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN
THE EMPEROR AND THIS WOMAN.
THEN WHAT WAS HE SUGGESTING?
WHAT?
OUT WITH IT.
SIR, I TOOK HIM RATHER
TO IMPLY THAT THIS LADY...
NOT THE EMPEROR, WAS THE PRIME
CAUSE OF YOUR QUARREL.
I HAVE CALLED HIM OUT NEAR
TO HALF A DOZEN TIMES.
THE CAVALRY KNOWS.
WOULD I HAVE DONE THAT
FOR SOME PETTY NONSENSE?
SHE WAS A LADY I HELD
IN HIGH ESTEEM.
HER SALON
WAS VERY WELL KNOWN IN...
STRASBOURG.
YES, NOW I RECALL
SOMETHING ELSE.
HE SAID TO ME
IN A PUBLIC STREET--
I HAVE IT BURNT IN MY MIND.
HE SAID TO ME...
"FOR ALL THAT I CARE, THEY CAN
SPIT UPON NAPOLEON BONAPARTE."
WHO WERE THEY?
THEY, THEY!
WHEN DID THE EMPEROR
NOT HAVE ENEMIES?
D'HUBERT IS A TURNCOAT!
THAT IS A FACT!
I SAY MORE. I SAY HE NEVER
LOVED THE EMPEROR! NEVER!
HE SAW A FAIR DEAL
OF CAMPAIGNING.
WHEN YOU MEET HIM, TELL HIM
I WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF IT...
AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY.
TO THE EMPEROR. GOOD LUCK TO HIM
AND TO THOSE THAT LOVE HIM.
Narrator:
BUT IN LESS THAN 100 DAYS,
NAPOLEON WAS DEFEATED.
AND I OFFER YOU
ANOTHER TOAST.
LET US GIVE THANKS
FOR THE SAFE RETURN...
OF HIS SACRED MAJESTY,
LOUIS XVIII.
GOD SAVE THE KING.
All: GOD SAVE THE KING.
AND DEVIL TAKE THE OGRE...
TO ST. HELENA.
THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE, IT SEEMS
A FIT AND PROPER PLACE FOR HIM.
COME, SIR.
YOU'RE A ROYALIST NOW...
LIKE THE REST OF US.
WHERE ELSE
WOULD YOU WISH HIM TO BE?
ONE CELEBRATION AT A TIME, SIR.
DON'T YOU THINK?
NO, I DO NOT.
THE BOY'S A ROYALIST.
AND I CAN GIVE YOU
MORE GOOD NEWS.
HE HAS BEEN SUMMONED TO ATTEND
UPON MARSHALL ST. CYR IN PARIS.
HE WILL HAVE A COMMAND
IN THE KING'S ARMY.
SO TELL US. WHAT FATE
WOULD YOU CHOOSE FOR THE OGRE?
I BELIEVE THE EMPEROR
CHOSE HIS OWN FATE.
IT WAS HIS HABIT TO DO SO.
I LEARNED MY TRADE
IN HIS SERVICE,
AS DID MARSHALL ST. CYR.
THE KING'S ARMY WILL HAVE
MORE REALISTS THAN ROYALISTS.
I HAVE JUST AGREED TO TERMS
WITH THIS LADY...
AND I'M MUCH TOO TIRED
FOR FURTHER QUESTIONING.
WELL DONE.
GOOD DAY, COLONEL.
D'HUBERT, ISN'T IT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU TOOK CARE
TO PLAY SAFE, EH?
VERY SPRUCE YOU LOOK TOO.
VERY TAME AND SPRUCE.
FOUND A NICE PLACE
WITH HIS MAJESTY, HAVE YOU?
NOW, GABRIEL FERAUD WAS RIGHT.
POOR DEVIL.
HE ALWAYS SAID
YOU WERE A SLIPPERY FELLOW.
HOW IS GENERAL FERAUD?
YOU DON'T KNOW?
IT INTERESTS ME VERY LITTLE.
IN FACT, I DO NOT KNOW.
FERAUD WAS ARRESTED.
THEY HAVE HIM
ON THE BUTCHER'S LIST.
HE'S TO GO BEFORE
THE SPECIAL COMMISSION?
YES.
NOW, THERE WAS A MAN
WHO WOULD RIDE
STRAIGHT AT ANYTHING.
HE ENDS UP AT THE MERCY
OF THAT SEWER RAT.
FOUCHE.
HE'S AS GOOD AS DEAD.
COME A LITTLE CLOSER, PLEASE.
I'M ALL ATTENTION.
I BELIEVE YOUR EXCELLENCY
HAS CHOSEN A LIST OF OFFICERS...
TO BE TRIED FOR TREASON
BY THE SPECIAL COURT.
I...
AM THE PRESIDENT OF
THE COMMISSION
THAT CHOSE THEM, YES.
I'VE COME TO PETITION
THAT THE NAME
OF GENERAL GABRIEL FERAUD...
BE REMOVED FROM THAT LIST.
I HAVE LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION--
MARSHALLS ST. CYR AND MacDONALD.
HAVE YOU INDEED?
BY ALL ACCOUNTS,
HE IS A RABID BONAPARTIST.
SO IS EVERY TROOPER
AND GRENADIER IN THE ARMY...
AS YOUR EXCELLENCY KNOWS.
GENERAL FERAUD
HASN'T THE BRAINS
TO MAKE HIMSELF DANGEROUS
TO ANYONE.
RATHER, HE COULD NOT
CONCEIVABLY HURT THE STATE.
HE HAS A BUSY TONGUE.
HE TALKED HIMSELF
ON TO OUR LIST.
WE COULD NOT KEEP HIM OFF IT.
I AM SOMETHING OF A VIRTUOSO
IN SURVIVAL.
YOU WILL BE AWARE OF THAT,
I THINK.
BESIDES,
I DESPISE THESE NOBODIES...
WHO OFFER THEIR NECK
TO THE BLOCK.
AT LEAST HE'S IN MY CONTROL,
BECAUSE IF IT WERE NOT...
MY OWN MEN WOULD MOST CERTAINLY
BE ON IT.
OUR NEW MASTERS
AND THEIR LADIES, BLESS THEM...
ARE OUT FOR A DEAL OF BLOOD.
PLEASE BE SEATED.
YOU HAVE AN HONEST
SOLDIER'S FACE, GENERAL...
BUT YOU HAVE COME HERE
TO INTRIGUE WITH ME.
IS THAT NOT SO?
HAVE YOU NOT COME HERE
TO INTRIGUE WITH ME?
IS THIS FELLOW
A RELATION OF YOURS?
NO.
INTIMATE FRIEND?
NO, NOT EXACTLY.
WE'VE HAD A...
LONG ASSOCIATION.
MYSTERIOUS.
STILL YOU HAVE
TWO MARSHALS AT YOUR BACK.
YES, THERE'S YOUR MAN.
FERAUD, GABRIEL FLORIAN.
HE WILL LIVE IN THE PROVINCES
UNDER POLICE SUPERVISION.
YOU REALIZE THAT, OF COURSE.
BUT HE WILL LIVE.
TAKE A PEN, MY DEAR FELLOW,
AND CROSS OUT THE NAME.
I CAN'T DO EVERYTHING FOR YOU.
YOUR EXCELLENCY, I MUST BEG YOU
TO KEEP MY INTERFERENCE
A SECRET.
MOST PARTICULARLY
FROM GENERAL FERAUD.
GENERAL FERAUD, ALIVE OR DEAD,
IS NOT WORTH A MOMENT'S GOSSIP.
THERE. GIVE ME YOUR HAND.
SIR, KICK FOR THE GENERAL.
THERE.
PERFECT DISCIPLINE.
THAT'S NOT A GRENADIER.
MOST LADYLIKE,
I ASSURE YOU.
HE'SNOT KICKINGYOU.
GENERAL.
THE FELLOW IN THE CAVALRY
YOU CALLED OUT SEVERAL TIMES--
D'HUBERT, WASN'T IT?
"GENERAL D'HUBERT, WHO'S BEEN
ON SICK LEAVE IN THE SOUTH...
IS TO TAKE COMMAND
OF THE FIFTH CAVALRY BRIGADE...
AT REIMS."
SAME FELLOW, ISN'T IT?
GOOD DAY.
GOOD DAY.
GOOD DAY.
SIR, I WONDER,
COULD YOU DIRECT US...
TO THE RESIDENCE
OF GENERAL ARMAND D'HUBERT?
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT WITH HIM?
I WANT A QUIET WORD
WITH HIM.
CONFIDENTIAL,
YOU UNDERSTAND.
THIS PLACE IS QUIET ENOUGH.
YOU AREN'T THE GENERAL,
ARE YOU, SIR, BY ANY CHANCE?
YES, SIR, I AM.
I THOUGHT SO.
MET YOU ONCE AFTER RATISBON.
WELL, SIR,
ALL WE NEED FOR THE PRESENT
ARE THE NAMES OF YOUR FRIENDS.
WHAT FRIENDS?
WE ARE THE FRIENDS
OF GEN. FERAUD.
WE'LL NEED TO WORK
PRETTY SHARP.
POLICE SURVEILLANCE.
THEY KEEP US BOTTLED UP
AT VATAN.
DAMN THEIR EYES.
SLIP OUT, SLIP BACK.
NO ONE THE WISER.
RISKY, OF COURSE,
BUT HONOR BEFORE EVERYTHING.
HONOR FIRST.
I COULD HAVE YOU
BOTH CARTED BACK
WHERE YOU COME FROM IN IRONS.
I SWEAR TO GOD, I COULD WHISPER,
ONLY WHISPER...
AND YOU'D BOTH BE DEAD
IN A DITCH BEFORE MORNING.
THIS IS ROYALIST COUNTRY.
THIS IS MY HOME.
WE HAVE PROCEEDED ON
THE ASSUMPTION
THAT YOU WERE
A GENTLEMAN.
YES, DAMN YOU.
DAMN YOU, I AM!
VERY WELL, THEN.
WE'D LIKE TO KNOW
YOUR FRIENDS' NAMES.
I HAVE NO FRIENDS STUPID ENOUGH
TO TAKE PART IN SUCH A FARCE.
I SUPPOSE I COULD ACT FOR HIM.
HE COULD ACT FOR YOU.
NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL
A STEADY FELLOW.
USED TO TAKE
A STEADY FELLOW
TO COMMAND A BRIGADE.
I DON'T SUPPOSE GENERAL FERAUD
WOULD ACCEPT AN APOLOGY.
OUT OF THE QUESTION.
YOU COULD DECLARE YOURSELF
UNFIT TO BE A SOLDIER
AND RESIGN YOUR COMMAND.
THAT MIGHT DO IT.
IT WOULDN'T DO.
THE GENERAL HAS RECEIVED
TOO DEEP AN INJURY.
I SEE.
I WILL MEET YOU TOMORROW
AT SUNRISE, HERE.
SABERS, WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE.
PISTOLS.
PISTOLS?
Adele: ARE YOU COMING
TO BED NOW?
I SHALL BE LATE.
I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO.
MY DEAR BOY.
I'M VERY SORRY.
DID I DISTURB YOU?
NO.
I WAS AWAKE.
I PROMISED THESE
FOR TOMORROW MORNING.
A TRADESMAN HAS TO KEEP
HIS WORD.
YOU OUGHT NOT
TO TIRE YOURSELF.
OH, I'M AN OLD MAN.
AWAKE AT ODD TIMES.
ASLEEP AT ODD TIMES.
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE UP.
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?
NO.
I HAVE SOME WORK
TO DO BEFORE MORNING
TO KEEP MY WORD.
MAY I?
YES, DO.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD DAY, SIR.
GOOD DAY TO YOU.
POOR GROUNDS, SIR.
NOT SUITABLE AT ALL.
OH, I THINK IT WILL DO.
WE CAME HERE TO KILL EACH OTHER.
ANY GROUND IS SUITABLE FOR THAT.
I SUGGEST THE GENERAL AND I
ENTER THE RUIN
FROM OPPOSITE SIDES...
ALONE AND SEEK EACH OTHER OUT.
TWO SHOTS EACH.
FIRE AT WILL.
IS IT AGREED?
I'LL CONSULT WITH THE OFFICER
WHO IS ACTING
FOR GENERAL FERAUD.
EVERYONE HEARD ME.
YES! I HEARD YOU.
WHICH SIDE?
EAST SIDE, GENERAL.
FORWARD.
SIR, I MUST
OWN MYSELF AT A LOSS.
I'M NOT FANATICAL ENOUGH
TO PERSEVERE IN THIS...
ABSURDITY.
LA!
GO ON. KILL ME.
NOW!
IS HE DEAD?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I WAS SO WORRIED.
I'M SORRY.
I HAD TO WORK LATE,
AND THEN I WENT FOR A WALK.
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?
D'HUBERT: YOU HAVE KEPT ME
AT YOUR BECK AND CALL
FOR 15 YEARS.
I SHALL NEVER AGAIN DO
WHAT YOU DEMAND OF ME.
BY EVERY RULE
OF SINGLE COMBAT,
YOUR LIFE NOW BELONGS TO ME.
IS THAT NOT CORRECT?
I SHALL SIMPLY
DECLARE YOU DEAD.
IN ALL OF YOUR DEALINGS WITH ME,
YOU WILL DO ME THE COURTESY...
TO CONDUCT YOURSELF
AS A DEAD MAN.
I HAVE SUBMITTED TO YOUR
NOTIONS OF HONOR LONG ENOUGH.
YOU WILL NOW SUBMIT TO MINE.
