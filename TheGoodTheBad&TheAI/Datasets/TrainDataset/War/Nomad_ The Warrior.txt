Man's voice:
For hundreds of years,
a great Asian region
bordered by Russia and China
has been home
to my people, the Kazakhs,
nomadic tribesmen roaming
from one pasture to another.
Since the time
of our legendary ancestor
Genghis Kahn, hordes of foreign invaders
have tried to conquer this land
and put an end
to our peaceful way of life.
Of all those who threaten
the lives of my people,
than the fierce
Jungar tribesmen from Mongolia.
Man's voice: The Jungars
brought war and destruction.
Our tribal leaders could not unite
against this deadly enemy.
So many fled from the horrors of war
that it became known as
hoping to see the fulfillment
of the prophecy that one day
a warrior descendent of Genghis Kahn
would rise up and unite all Kazakhs
have always believed
I would see this come to pass,
and I have searched far and wide
for the promised child.
Surround him.
Man: Are you the one
they call Oraz the wise?
Yes, I am Oraz.
The Great Khan of all Jungars, Galdan
Ceren, commands us to bring you to him.
You may tell your Great Khan
that I am not a Jungar,
and I do not have to obey his command.
Such words can cause a man's death.
However, my orders
are to bring you in alive.
- Take him.
-
Man: You are wise, Oraz.
You know that if we return without you,
we could lose our heads.
That would be unfortunate.
I would not wish
your children to curse me.
I have found him, Great Kahn.
So you are Oraz.
I have heard much about you.
It is said that you understand
the languages of all animals.
- Is this true?
- That is only given to God.
Although you won't deny
that you understand horses.
People say that as well.
Perhaps then you will
choose a horse for me,
the finest of the herd.
Oraz: The chestnut stallion
with the white streak,
that is the best horse,
a horse fit for a Great Khan
who makes the earth tremble.
Do you know what awaits you
if you are wrong, wise man?
- На!
-
Hey, Kazakh.
By God, you're right.
The horse you chose
is fit for a great ruler.
You are right, Kazakh. You're gifted.
And for this,
I will make you the master of my stables
and pay you your weight in gold.
Oraz: Gold cannot replace freedom,
nor does it bring happiness.
Beware of your words, Oraz.
Your path may be a perilous one.
My path has already been
determined by the stars,
and I must follow it.
You speak with such
certainty about the future.
How brightly will my star keep burning?
You know yourself even stars fall
from the skies,
and new stars are born.
Wise one, this new star-
I must know, tell me his name.
I will know that when I find him.
Oraz: Whatever perils
awaited me in my path,
"О Creator,
when will You send my people
the fearless warrior
who will unite all of our tribes
and suddenly, I knew
that the savior of my people
Danger! Danger,
Great Kahn!
Oh, great Galdan,
I've had a terrible vision
of a child born to a Kazakh sultan
who will one day cross your path
and end your golden reign.
You must hunt down this wolf cub
and kill him at once.
So the Kazakh was right.
Sharish, find this Kazakh child
- and kill it.
- Yes, my lord.
- На!
-
- As-salaam-alaikum.
- Alaikum-salaam.
The child of the prophecy.
Are you looking for someone, Oraz?
I have already found him.
Prepare for a Jungar attack.
Jungars!
Jungars! Protect the carriage.
Give me the child. Hurry.
Hey, Kazakhs!
Leave him! I will kill him myself.
Where is the child?
There is no child here.
Sultan.
Ah.
I need to talk to you.
Talk.
Sultan: I'll listen to you.
Jungars attacked the caravan
that's bringing your wife here.
I know.
They've all been killed,
my wife and my son.
Your son lives.
I was able to save the boy.
My boy.
How will I repay you, Oraz?
I'm used to traveling light, Sultan.
I cannot let you go
without some reward.
Ask me, what do you wish?
Give me your son.
How can your tongue
speak such words, Oraz?
I haven't let the Jungar know
that your son is alive.
There is no safer place
in the world for him than with me,
here in my palace.
Somebody told the Jungar
about the caravan.
They were looking for him.
You ask for that
which is most precious to me.
Go and raise him a good warrior.
Remember, keep your back straight.
Keep your heels down.
Feel the rhythm of the horse.
Feel his spirit.
The horse is a Kazakh's best friend.
He is your wings.
You must learn to take good care of him.
Oraz: I gathered them
from all parts of the steppe.
/ picked only the best,
each from a different tribe.
They all worked hard
to become true warriors,
that one of them
was a son of Sultan Wall.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
- How many eyes does a nomad have?
- Two.
Four.
Two in front and two behind.
Tell me your names and tribes.
- Barak, Agai tribe.
- Zar, Ermek tribe.
- Azamat, Tursyn.
- Kairat, Kuntu tribe.
- Mansur, I'm a Kazakh.
- Bolat, Ermek tribe.
- Ere, Uzbek.
- I'm Erali, a Kazakh.
- Eren, Alighe tribe.
- You said you were a Kazakh.
Don't you know the name of your tribe?
Mansur and I say Kazakh.
These boys are the hope of our nation.
You have trained good students.
Well done. Let's move on
to our next lesson.
You are growing older
and older, my friend.
I ask you, О Great One,
in the memory of our deceased ancestors,
that our land be free
of our enemies and be reborn.
Our ancestors roamed
across this great steppe.
Once, long ago, the nomads
led by the great Attila
defeated Rome,
the mightiest of empires in the West.
In the East, they took China.
But, most of all, they loved their land,
and they always came back.
And the Kazakh roamed
from south to north,
after the spring, together
with their herds and flocks.
Oraz: No one has yet written
the true history of our people.
Only the elders tell of our warriors
and their great victories.
I want you to know
which people you belong to
and to swear loyalty to each other.
Our colt was born
on the night of the new moon.
Mansur: He's a good horse, Gahar.
What's his name?
-1 call him Moonchild.
- That's a good name.
Why are you looking at me?
You're the one who's looking.
No, I'm not. It's you.
Hey, Kazakh, come out and fight.
Or are you a coward?
Mansur, don't you recognize us?
- Erali, is that you?
- Scared you, didn't we?
I'm not scared of anything. Let's go!
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Straight...
the mighty Jungar army
invaded our land once again.
Honored Oraz, Sultan Wali requests
that you accompany him
to Abulkhair's camp.
That's enough.
I'm gonna beat you.
Perhaps.
Man: Gather, everyone.
О Almighty, let the horses be strong.
Let the land be prosperous.
Let my people's spirit rise.
May our enemies be overcome.
Let the game begin.
- Amen.
- All: Amen.
Yes!
If we do not reach an agreement soon,
our homeland will disappear.
That is why I've called
the tribes together.
Tell us what you are suggesting,
honored Abulkhair.
One of us should be
declared as the leader,
and an alliance must be formed.
I suggest we unite with the
Russians to the west.
I submit to no one.
Abulkhair, I'm certain
if we form an alliance,
we will lose our freedom.
The Kazakhs have
always been a free people,
subject to no law
but God's and our own.
If we are to die, let us die free.
Honored Barak,
no one doubts your courage,
but we must join together
or be destroyed by the Jungar armies,
- as the prophecy decrees.
- It's nonsense!
- It's an insult.
- Wait, listen to Abulkhair.
Abulkhair: Now what?
Mansur, are you asleep?
- No.
-1 need to talk to you.
My heart is bursting.
I have not been able to sleep all night.
Something's happened to me,
something I have never felt before.
What? What is it?
I feel- I feel dizzy
as if I am high above
the ground looking down.
And your knees tremble,
and the stars are falling,
and you walked along the bank
of the river and stood in the rain
- and wanted to shout out loud.
-Yes.
I now realize the kind of woman
the mother of my children should be.
In other words, you are in love.
Yes.
It happened on the swing.
She was next to me.
Her eyes and her voice.
Why did I not notice it before?
- As-salaam-alaikum.
- Alaikum-salaam.
I see sadness in your eyes, my son.
You should look into my eyes.
You will see an even greater sadness.
Our hopes for uniting
the Kazakh peoples...
have collapsed.
You and Erali are like my two hands.
And now much is expected of you.
Oh, misery!
I bring terrible news.
Darkness falls over the land,
a curse on the reign
of Galdan, the Great Kahn.
I bring news, my lord, terrible news.
Great Galdan,
О ruler of the steppes,
my master and protector, your wisdom
is boundless, and your reign is just
and truly magnificent, but the child,
the one from the prophecy,
the Kazakh, has not been destroyed.
He lives. Woe to us all.
He will bring ruin to the Jungars.
Your mighty star will be extinguished,
unless- you must find this Kazakh
and put an end to his life.
Now this Kazakh will die.
Но!
I haven't seen Moonchild in ages.
- He's grown.
- Yes, we have all grown up.
Here.
You dropped it from the swing.
You can keep it if you want.
I can't.
Why?
Because my friend loves you.
I know.
He is like a brother to me.
Me too, but I'm not your sister.
You have the scent of the moon.
Does the moon have a scent?
Black flag-
something happened.
Gahar: Protect him, Almighty.
Oraz: The Jungar army
was approaching Turkistan,
laying waste to our land,
killing the men,
It would not be long
before they destroyed
We cannot leave Turkistan to the enemy.
If we survive, we can rebuild the city.
Now we must think about saving lives.
And who would lead us into battle?
Who could unite the tribes?
You have a son, Sultan.
His time has come.
Where is he, Oraz?
When will I see him?
How will I recognize him?
You wanted your son
to grow up to be a warrior.
Warriors are recognized in battle.
I will come back.
You go with them. We will find you.
Mansur: Moonchild,
take good care of her.
Look after your sister.
Did you talk to her?
No, I did not.
Did you?
We will let fate decide.
Our earth oil burns well.
The children and the others
are leaving the city.
Only those who
carry weapons will remain.
There are ancient
hidden tunnels under the city.
Meant for escape?
We can all vanish without a trace.
Do the Jungars know about it?
Unfortunately, often they know more
than we need them to know.
- Here, give her to me.
- Thank you.
Stay with your brother.
Zenep, Zenep, I'm going back.
Why?
Whatever happens,
I want to be with them.
What about us?
You're safe now. The gorge is there.
Gahar, Gahar!
Kasim, Kasim!
Stop her. She's leaving us.
- Gahar: Why are you following me?
- Man: Mansur ordered me to.
Gahar: Well, I order you
to stay at the porch.
-1 will not let you go alone.
- Please, Kasim.
-
-
Sharish: Where are you going and why?
-1 will not tell you.
- Of course you will.
I will sooner die.
- He's still a child.
- Who is he to you?
He's my brother.
Do you want to save his life?
If you marry me, I will let him live,
and you will bear me a real warrior.
Your brother will stay with me.
If you harm yourself in any way,
he will be tortured to death
cursing your name.
Take her to our camp.
Woman: To be the wife
of a great warrior like Sharish
is an honor that very few
women can boast of.
На!
It's good to cry.
A woman's tears wash away
her sadness, like a long rain.
Aww...
Hurry and prepare her.
She must be ready when my son
returns from his victory.
Man: We cannot take
this city with swords alone.
We must ask Galdan
for stronger weapons.
No. I will take the town myself.
The Kazakhs will never surrender.
I suggest you make another proposal.
I propose a fight:
One against one.
You win, we leave.
We win, you surrender.
There will be a duel
between two warriors.
If the Kazakh wins, they leave.
If the Jungar wins,
we will surrender without a fight.
I think we should accept it.
Did they give the name of their warrior?
- It's Sharish.
- Sharish!
May I speak, Teacher?
You taught us to fight any opponent.
- And today we are all ready.
- Soldiers: We are ready!
You'll be satisfied with me, Teacher.
Bless me.
I believe you, Erali.
But Mansur will fight Sharish.
It was Sharish that killed your mother.
Man: О Almighty,
help our warrior prevail over his enemy.
Let the spirit of his grandfather Ablai
help him defend his people.
- Amen.
- All: Amen.
Did you pray, Kazakh?
For you are about to die.
Am I? You tried this 20 years ago.
-
-Sharish: Ha! Ha!
-
- Hy-ah!
Hoo-ah!
На!
Erali! Erali!
- What's wrong?
- The Jungars have captured Gahar.
Gahar? We have to free her.
Don't tell Mansur.
Forgive me for not being able
to call you my son for so long.
I'm proud of you.
I did my duty.
I avenged my mother.
Tell me about her.
I will.
I promise you.
You mother was a noble woman.
My son.
Oraz: Messengers were sent
to the tribes of the great steppe
to announce that
a new leader had arisen.
Hope began to stir
in the breasts of our people.
And they gave their
new leader a new name-
-
-
Ablai will see no one.
I am Erali!
So be it.
Erali...
I'm leaving.
What happened?
I must go.
Erali, we have to be together.
I need you.
Did you know from the beginning
that you were the Sultan's son?
No, I didn't.
And it makes no difference to us.
You were a brother to me.
And you are still a brother to me.
Well, if I am still a brother to you...
then you will understand.
I didn't tell him anything, Teacher.
You did the right thing.
People need a leader.
He mustn't leave the city.
Your noble heart knows its course.
I do not have a noble heart.
It's just that I love her.
Erali: Goodbye.
Forgive me, my boy.
Why didn't you stop him, Teacher?
Oraz: I cannot change his destiny.
He was born to help you
achieve your mission.
I don't understand.
What is my mission?
You were chosen by the stars
to become a warrior
who will unite all Kazakhs.
I shall be leaving you tomorrow.
Why?
There comes a time when a young eagle
must be thrown out of the nest
onto the rocky mountain...
to see how he flies.
Is there anything else I need to know?
Be aware of betrayal.
Great Galdan!
Sharish has been
struck down in battle!
Great Khan!
The Kazakhs send us this.
Open it.
They killed him?
A new Kazakh warrior has appeared.
They call him Ablai.
Ablai is Mansur!
The wolf cub I told you about.
I warned you to kill this child.
So, he does exist.
Silence! I will avenge him!
I will avenge him.
What news do you bring?
This is the time we spoke of.
Mansur/Ablai's voice:
О hallowed tree of my childhood,
and I pray for the safety
of my dear friends...
-
-
Man: Do not kill him!
Galdan wants him alive.
Man: These new weapons
he brought are like thunder itself.
- Sanji.
- Yes, lord?
Can you use these on the Kazakhs?
Yes, Galdan. Easily.
-
-
The enemy is ours!
- Victory!
-
It has always been
the custom of the steppe
to treat one's host with respect.
We Kazakhs put our hand upon our heart
when crossing a stranger's threshold.
But how am I to do that
when it is tied behind my back?
I see that you respect
the customs of the nomads.
But where is it written that a warrior
is captured away from the battlefield?
It is I who captured you!
So I will cut your head off
like you did my brother's.
You brother was an enemy of my people.
And I killed him in a fair fight.
I will honor the commandments
of the nomads.
Genghis Khan's captured descendant
cannot be executed.
But he can be forced to face our trials.
If you pass, I will let you go.
But if you do not pass,
you will perish in our prison.
It's your choice.
Moonchild!
Hey! Hey, where did you get that horse?
It was my father
who gave the horse to me.
It belonged to the Kazakh girl.
Take care of him. He's a good horse.
Give him some yellow grass.
He likes that best.
Hy-ah!
How did that man know my horse's name?
- What are you talking about?
- The prisoner.
Moonchild recognized him too.
That can't be.
- It's impossible.
- He called him Moonchild.
What else did he say?
- He told me he was a good horse.
- Would you like to prove that he is?
- How?
- Tomorrow...
Mansur/Ablai's voice:
I have let myself be captured.
О Almighty, help me defend my honor
in the face of the enemy.
Soldier: Get up.
Get up! Time to fight.
Man: Come on, pay up.
Let's go. You too.
The Kazakh won.
He won again.
He's unbeatable.
- Isn't that your horse?
- Yes, it's my horse!
Untie him.
Moonchild. God protect him.
Mansur- please.
You proved that you are
a brave and skillful warrior.
Before you, no one has
ever survived this test.
According to our laws,
-1 must now set you free.
- No! No!
He must be killed!
Otherwise, the spirit of Sharish
will never rest peacefully.
I respect your grief,
but revenge has blinded you.
If we break our own laws,
our ancestors will turn away from us
and the bond between the living
and the dead will be broken.
What choice do I have?
The prisoner must die in a duel.
And there is one who can defeat him.
Huh?
- Where is the prisoner?
- Over there.
Where are you going?
I have food for the Kazakh.
No! You cannot pass.
Get out of here!
Get up, Kazakh!
Listen to me.
Your time has come.
This is your last fight.
If you win, great Galdan
will set you free.
Who are you?
I am Hocha, Galdan's daughter.
You were magnificent the other day.
Just as you were
when you defeated Sharish.
I am honored to hear such praise
from one as beautiful as you.
Unfortunately, you are doomed.
They will not let you live
even if you win the fight.
You could lose your head
for telling me this.
I have already lost my head.
I have long waited for a warrior
as strong and as brave as you.
I know a way to save you.
You must marry a Jungar woman.
If you marry me,
you will be a prince of our people.
Thank you, but I cannot accept.
Your opponent has
already been brought here.
He has never known defeat.
Tomorrow, you will
lose your head for certain.
Man: You will never see
your opponent's face.
And he will never see yours.
Put it on.
Begin.
Damn the evil!
No!
Curse you, Kazakh!
I knew it was you—
from the first blow.
Don't show your tears to the enemy.
Do not blame yourself.
We have done what
we were destined to do.
Gahar is here.
Save her.
No!
Bury him with the honor he is due.
It will be so.
I promised you your freedom.
And you shall have it- tomorrow.
Show him to the tent for honored guests.
Tonight, we will celebrate his victory!
More, my poisonous friend.
I need enough venom to kill a horse.
О Almighty One,
help me to take his life.
- Is there enough?
- Yes, I think so.
For you, honored warrior.
Mansur! It's poison!
-
-
Get on, quick!
Gahar: Come on, Moonchild!
Mansur/Ablai's voice:
Did you know that this would happen?
How can it be that birds
from the same flock,
like best friends that
grew up to become brothers,
Someone must give his life
so that another can prevail
- Why are you looking at me?
- No, you are looking at me.
I am not.
You remember I told you
you had the scent of the moon?
Do you know what I really wanted to say?
I wanted to say...
I love you.
-
-
I sent messengers to all the tribes.
- And the troops?
- Maybe they are late.
What is wrong with us, Father?
We Kazakhs are not helping
each other in this time of need.
My son-
It takes time.
Tribes are trying to gather
their warriors even now.
Yes.
I hope that you're right.
I'll stall for time.
Honored Ablai, we filled
the tunnels as you ordered.
Very good.
What were you doing there?
I want to fight the enemy too, Master.
You're too young.
Go back to your family.
I don't have a family.
The Jungars killed them all.
- What do they call you?
- Erali.
Erali, come and stay with me, hmm?
Mm-hmm.
Man: О Almighty,
hasten the tribes to our rescue.
Grant that with our help we may survive.
The Kazakhs have sent a messenger.
Tear him to pieces!
Do it!
-
-
That is our fate
if the tribes do not unite.
I give them until morning to surrender.
Mansur/Ablai's voice:
I am the only one who knows
But this battle can only be won
with the help of all tribes
Honored Ablai,
Sultan Barak is coming.
But he's two days away.
The river is flooded.
He's trying to get across.
Get some rest.
Don't worry.
I saved it.
With this, no one can beat you.
Take care of our child.
Khan: Raze the city to the ground!
Take no prisoners!
As for Ablai, I command you
to bring me his head.
They will kill all of us.
Honored Ablai,
we are ready to attack.
- We have to wait.
- What?
Until they are closer.
Son, we could all escape
through the tunnels.
There is no escape.
I ordered them filled with earth oil.
Honored Ablai!
- The Sultan is sending men—
- How many?!
I don't know-
He is—
We'll fight to the death.
All great spirits of Kazakh warriors,
help us today
in this fight for our land.
Why are we fleeing?
We have them outnumbered
by thousands!
Cowards! Stop running!
Fight to the death!
All of you! Stop! We are Jungars!
Man: The tribes are here!
Reinforcements have arrived!
Let us fulfill our destiny.
- Amen.
- Amen.
На! На!
Stay and fight! Cowards! Traitors!
Fight to the death!
To the death!
Fight! Kill Ablai!
Bring me his head!
Oraz: The battle
by the great walls of Turkistan
Blood flowed like rivers
from both sides.
my people finally
came together as one,
as our forefathers had under
Genghis Khan many years before.
Boy: Let me go!
Man: Shall I kill him, Ablai?
Kazakhs don't kill children.
Bring him along.
This sword belonged to the great Khan,
defender of our land.
You are his descendant.
And now that you have
defeated the Jungar...
the Kazakh people
are ready to follow you as one.
I will be worthy of their trust.
All Kazakhs!
All: Ablai! Ablai! Ablai!
Ablai! Ablai! Ablai!
Man #1: Who are you?
Man #2: Messengers with a special trust.
Grandfather! Grandfather!
Come here, my boy.
Ah...
- What is in the sack?
- Open it.
It is the face of the earth.
Here are the Tian Shan Mountains.
Here live the Indians and the Afghans.
And this is...
Ka-za-khia. It is immense.
-Who sent this?
- Ablai Khan.
"From this day forth,
all Jungars and enemies of our people
must know that from the-"
Mansur's/Ablai's voice:
"From this day forth,
must know that from
the TianShan Mountains
to the Aral Sea lies a land
that has been inhabited
We will greet our friends
with open arms,
but to our enemies,
we will show no mercy.
