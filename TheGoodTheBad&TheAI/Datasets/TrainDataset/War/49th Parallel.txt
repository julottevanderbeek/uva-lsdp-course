Gun crew!
Get to those stations!
Fine work, Hirth.
Magnificent,
So the curtain rises on Canada.
Stand by! Stand by!

Stop motors!
Find the captain.
Question him.
Kuhnecke!
- Yes,
What in the devil's name are you doing?
Where's your camera?
Hang on, boy.
Man the gun.
Yes, we'll make it.
Come on, all together.
Stop!
Where's your captain?
The old man's dead.
He went down to the cabin to get the ship's papers.
He must've got caught when she rolled.
Your first officer?
- Jackie's dead too, isn't he?
- Yes.
Your second officer.
- Here.
- Come on deck.
- The ship?
- The
- Your destination?
- Montreal.
Your cargo?
Crude oil.
- How many tons?
- Three thousand.
That's a lie. You were carrying a full cargo —
- Is that correct?
- If you say so.
Action stations!
Prepare to dive!
- Flood five.
- Flood five.
- Depth, 30 meters.
- Thirty.
Here come the boys!
Give 'em a cheer!
Only a fool would imagine
we could raid enemy ships for supplies now.
Outgoing ships will be detained,
incoming ships heavily convoyed...
at least for the next few days.
We must find a spot where the enemy
is least likely to seek us out...
which is not being patrolled every day...
where they'll never think
of looking for us.
Hudson Bay.
Too many damned icebergs about.
- What's our position?
- Three miles off Point Amour.
If we go up, we risk the patrols,
but we'll make better time.
If we stay below,
we risk the ship.
I'm going up.
Action stations!
Where are we?
The North Pole?
Belle Isle Straits.
There's a lot of ice coming down.
- Fifty degrees.
- Fifty degrees,
Ah.
Good.
I can see the opening dead ahead.
Take a look here.
Yes,
Those are the cliffs he mentions in his notes.
Stand by.

- Will you go in?
- Yes.
Canada.
you have your orders.
Leutnant Kuhnecke,
Your mission is
to bring back food and fuel.
Over that hill you will find
a Hudson's Bay trading post.
If the men there are armed
and are foolish enough to offer resistance...
Jahner!
Take this flag.
As soon as the post is captured,
you will hoist it and I shall bring the ship in.
Do not forget, you are the first of
the German forces to set foot on Canadian soil —
Today, Europe.
Tomorrow, the whole world!
At ease.
Follow me.

It's her, all right. U-37.
It's theJerry, boys.
Carry out attack.

Okay, kid.
- Down, all of you!
- Get below! Crash dive!
And now let Papa try.
We're hit!
- Five.
Swine! Filthy swine! Devils!
Jahner!
- Hello, Johnnie.
- Hey, what's going on here? Who are you?
Somebody's fond of potatoes
around here.
This one, boss, him no eat potatoes
one whole year, Johnnie.
Stop calling me "Johnnie." And my hot water!
Who's been using my hot water, eh?
This one, boss. Very dirty boss.
Him no take bath one whole year, Johnnie.
I know that voice.
##
Johnnie!
Albert!
You old walrus!
By golly, it's dandy to see you!
- When did you get in?
- One half hour ago.
I find the water on the stove
and the dinner cooking and I say...
"Johnnie, you're in luck,
Your friend Albert is expect you!"
- What do you think of my whiskers?
She is dandy, huh?
- Oh, manor grand!
Give me a scissor and your razor quick!
I cut 'em!
Oh, sure, Johnnie. I'm hopin'
you're gonna stay for a while this time.
Sure thing. I stay till the boat come.
And wait till you see my skins.
I had the best year I never had.
And now I'm gonna get so busy
doing nothing.
Yes, sir, I'm gonna do nothing
like she's never been done before.
Trois Rivieres,
TrapperJohnnie Barras is anxious
to send a message...
to his father, Napoleon Barras
of, eh —
And his mother, and his eight sisters
and six brothers —
to tell 'em that he's arrived safely
this evening at Wolstenholme Post...
after a successful 11 months
hunting and trapping.
-
-  Hudson Bay House, Winnipeg, speaking.
-  Nice work, Johnnie!
This is Ed speaking.
- Hiya!
Good night, Wolstenholme.
Good night.
Good night, Winnipeg.
Good night.
I've been answering that question
till I'm fair sick and tired of it.
Not a soul comes through this post
that doesn't ask it, huskies and all.
where is ship?
- Behind the hill!
Come on. Sit down.
Well, what's the news from home, eh?
Some good, some bad.
Everyone is well.
That is good.
Business is slow.
That is bad.
My father say it is because
of them war rumors.
But he tell me no worry.
This Hitler is only bluffing.
You look to me as I go mad.
Of course, I was forgetting.
You can't have seen a paper in over a year.
What do you mean?
- Has it happened, then?
- Sure it's happened. Bigger than the last.
- Who fighting?
- Who starting first?
- Oh, the Germans, of course.
They marched in on the Poles
in September 1939.
- The Poles?
- Sure.
I thought all the poles
was in Canada!
No, no, Johnnie.
They've given Poland a terrible time.
Wiped out Warsaw.
And those poor refugees —You know, the women
and children who tried to get away—
they machine-gunned them down.
The Germans are ordinary men,
same as you and me.
I wouldn't do a thing like that. Would you?
Well, you can't tell me they do.
That's all newspaper talk
to try and bring us in.
A wee bit late, Johnnie, my lad.
We  in.
Canada, in the war?
Sure she is.
Didn't you hear the bombing tonight?
Bombing?
Was that bombing?
Sure. One of our planes went across.
Maneuvering, I suppose.
Yi-yi-yi-yi.
So, Canada, she in the war.
Anyhow, you can't tell me
French Canada got mixed in it too.
- I certainly can.
But that beat me!
I don't see what for French Canada
had to go to defend a bunch of Poles!
I don't get that at all.
I don't see what that mean to us.
Anyhow, one kind government...
much same like 'nother.
Yeah, you're right there.
We're all the same.
Don't get you nowhere.
Anyhow, we needn't
worry about it out here.
That suit me.
- What about a wee drink, Johnnie, eh?
-  That suit me too.
##
- Well, here's the skin off your nose.
- And off yours too, you old walrus.
Ay-yi-yi.
I won't sleep well tonight.
- Never do first night in real bed.
- ##
I was just the same
when I was trapping.
Oh, but you get used to it
in a couple of nights.
##
Dogs are noisy tonight.
Seem like your and mine
getting to know one 'other.
##
Aye, the wind is blowing up.
##
-
- A regular Montreal concert.
- Window! Door!
- Hello.
- Move out.
- Johnnie!
- Stay where you are.
- Door locked,
- No one else here?
- Only this.
- Search him. Kranz and Lohrmann,
search the other two.
You've ammunition and rifles here.
Where are they?
They're in the cupboard.
Kranz, your rifle.
Do not smash cupboard.
Cupboard's not locked.
- Where are the rifles?
- Better tell him.
- In the store.
- Which is the store?
Big building outside
with the company sign.
Vogel. Kranz.
What sort of crook are you anyhow?
What's the game?
Sure we hear there war on!
You —
- German.
- Yes! German! We are German!
Okay. Why yell about it?
You German.
I'm Canadian,
he Canadian and he Canadian.
My father fight against you last time. We give
you one good licking then, and we do it again.
Johnnie!
Don't any of you guy ever laugh?
The English tell us we've no sense of humor,
which means simply that our humor
is different from theirs.
Ah. I tell Nick.
He appreciate that.
- Nick?
- My servant, who your man kick
when he can't kick back.
The Eskimos
are racially as low as Negroes.
- What's the matter with Negroes?
- They're semi-apes, only one degree above theJews.
Who says so?
Those are the führer's own words,
from
Ah,
I make my living trapping animal.
But if I was meet half-ape, I wouldn't kick him
in the stomach as you did that husky in there.
Please don't abuse our kindness. We're trying
to be friendly, but you're making it difficult.
Okay, okay, okay.
##
Do you have to
waste my batteries?
- I want you to answer a few questions.
- Let's hear them first.
What transportation have you
with the outside world?
Transportation? I'll have to walk
to the railway, or else wait for the boat.
- When does the next boat arrive?
- If the weather's good, she'll be here this July.
If the ice closes,
it'll be theJuly after that.
- I want the truth.
- You callin' me a liar?
- Yes.
- ##
You ask me to believe
that you've only one ship a year?
Believe it or not,
it's all the same to me, my wee man.
- Where's the nearest railway?
- Churchill.
Churchill.
- Aha! You'll soon find out!
-
- Lake Harbor.
You seem to know all about it, eh?
- What strength is it?
- Uh, 30 men. Or is it 25, Albert?
Or two.
Where you get him?
- How 'bout this for a map?
Where'd you get it?
- Did you ever meet a missionary called Malotte?
- Malotte! Sure! You remember him, Albert?
- A flying missionary.
- I mind him.
You remember that time his airplane was lost
and all the people pray for his safety?
- He was a good missionary.
- He was one grand fellow.
And an even better mapmaker.
Oh, so that was it.
The spyin' blackguard.
I would never have believed it,
a man of his cloth.
Oh, and good.
Good priest like Malotte too.
And a good German.
In a report from the far north,
Cape Ross reports heavy slop ice from —
Come in, C-Y-7-B.
C-Y-7-B.
That's  call signal.
Who is it?
Oh, just a friend of mine.
An American from Grand Rapids, Michigan.
- He plays chess with me.
- Chess?
- Why?
To pass the time!
He don't often get
such pleasant company here.
Board's over there on the table by the radio.
We play three nights a week.
First night we've missed
in nearly two years.
C-Q-ing C-Y-7-B.
Try again in 15 minutes.
If still missing,
will report to Winnipeg.
- What is he going to report?
- That an accident might have happened to me.
- He's got to do something about it.
- It's the head office of our company.
- What company?
Hirth.
Tell me, uh...
do you really march around in Berlin
doing this?
- Yes.
- Oh.
Why?
You seem to forget that I'm a high party member,
one of the first million in 1930.
You didn't even join till 1936.
One of the first 70 million — that's you.
And I'm a practical man too.
I'm not a dreamer, an idealist, like you.
It's all a question of experience.
I'm an engineer. I understand ships, radio,
planes, and I understand human nature.
I tell you, I'm right, Hirth.
They must play chess!
Our position is too dangerous to allow
one of these men a free hand with the radio.
- Free hand? With my gun at the back of his head?
- That makes no difference.
Do you want that noisy American butting in
and causing trouble? He's going to notify Winnipeg.
They'll have heard about our submarine being
bombed, and they'll put two and two together.
I'm right, Hirth.
They must play chess.
-  I know what I'm doing. Watch me.
You haven't lost this one yet, have you?
- Are you ready?
- Aye, I'm ready.
- Pawn B-7 to B-5.
-
-
-
Why did my wife have to go to a double feature
the one night I had you on the run?
But you come to the wrong man.
I won't guide you
to the railroad, me.
- You never make it anyhow.
- Why not?
This is one big country.
But very few people.
Everyone know everybody.
You can't make a goose step through it
without the police find out.
- But no one has seen us.
Ah!
If one husky dog
have the smell of you...
his boss know
from the way he howl...
that there is stranger in district.
One Eskimo might find your track.
Maybe have.
Most likely that Eskimo is on his way
to Mounted Police right now.
Perhaps, perhaps.
But you must help us.
After all, it's your own interest,
now that your country has surrendered.
My country? Surrender?
At 12:30 on the 17 th ofJune, 1940...
France laid down her arms.
France? Ah!
I'm Canadian!
Certainly.
You are a French-Canadian.
But after the war, the führer intends to
liberate your people from the British tyranny.
How?
French Canada will be free.
will be free.
I  free!
Or, I was plenty free
till you guys got in.
I mean the freedom of your people,
an oppressed minority.
The freedom to speak their own language,
to have their own schools and churches...
to govern their own affairs.
Here you will find it written
in the führer's own words.
Perhaps you've read it.
Uh, I have no room in my pack
for any book.
I know my Bible.
That's enough for me.
This  the Bible. You must get a copy.
It will explain everything to you as it has to me.
You better look up
how to get out of Canada, then.
Maybe she don't tell you that, huh?
Ah!  funny.
Maybe, uh, your führer
ain't so smart as he think.
Don't he know that we French Canadians
have always our own school?
And church.
And the right to speak as we want.
And run our own affair, by golly.
No doubt you have certain privileges,
but I don't feel —
Let me ask you one question.
Well?
How about them, uh...
Poles?
How 'bout the French?
Do you let them run
their own affair?
That is different.
The whole new order in Europe —
Okay, okay.
You said enough.
Hello! Hello!
Russell speaking.
Say, my wife's just brought in an extra.
The whole front page is covered with news about
that submarine your flyers knocked off up there.
Tell him the headline reads
"Nazi U-boat —"
Then take a back seat and  read it.
Hello! Hello! Is that you, Mac?
This is Maude speaking.
"Nazi U-boat sunk in Hudson Bay."
That's the headline.
"According to an official report...
"the squadron leader claimed
that several direct hits by medium bombs...
- How come you didn't know about it?
-  Why didn't you tell us?
-
-
- Get your rifles.
- Come out.
-
-
- You can't leave him there like that.
Dirty lot of murderers.
-
- All quiet,
- Good.
Can't have heard the shot.
- Johnnie?
-
Johnnie.
Johnnie, my son.
It's nearly 1:00.
It'll be three, four hours
before there's anybody about.
If anybody should come to the post,
we'll see they don't get away.
Kranz, Lohrmann,
get him into the other room.
- What about the radio?
- Dead.
I wonder if that American in Michigan
got anything.
Idiot!
- Well, that should do it, Vogel, eh?
Herr Leutnant.
- Shut up!
Herr Leutnant?
I've got it! Wake him up! Quickly!
- Jahner.
- What is it?
- What kind of a plane?
- An emergency plane from Churchill!
- Johnnie.
The company's sending a plane.
- Who can handle a plane?
- I can.
- Anyone else handle a plane?
- No,
- No,
- You don't doubt that I have the experience.
- How many flying hours?
- Enough.
It'll have to be you then.
What about our clothes?
We can't go like this.
- You mean our uniforms?
- Don't be a sentimental fool.
Can't expect to escape
in these outfits.
You're right, for once.
Men, this is our one chance of escape.
Our only one. We must be ready for it.
We must have new clothes, money,
food, rifles, ammunition.
- Where do you keep the money?
- There is none.
- Don't lie to me. You sell things here.
- Not for money. It's exchange, barter.
Plenty of coats,
What's the trouble at the post?
What's happened to the factor?
Nothing happen at the post.
My son go to white man yesterday.
No come back yet.
Anybody else at the post?
TrapperJohnnie.
Stay one day.
I'm a German officer.
I warn you not to resist.
- Run, Les!
- Aim low.
Kuhnecke and Lohrmann,
get the boats loaded.
Jahner! Vogel!
Report to me when ready!
Hey, you.
Give him some water.
It's behind me.
You're a Christian, aren't you?
No, I'm not.
Rosary.
What's he trying to say?
He wants his rosary.
What's the good of that to him?
When —
When...
we win...
the war...
we...
send you...
some...
missionaries.
All ready,
Contact!
I can't take off!
We're overloaded!
Throw something out!
Jahner.
That'll do!
Still no use!
Everything'll have to go!
- Throw out the rifles!
- How low is the gas?
- It's all right.
Are you sure we have enough? Our maximum speed
seems to be about 145 kilometers an hour.
A hundred and sixty.
there's a note here.
- Can't risk it.
- Seems a shorter course.
Yes, but longer over the sea.
Some of the magnetic variations up here
are as much as 40 degrees.
By taking 269 degrees...
we can pick up the bush railway
down the coast as far as Lake Winnipeg.
But we'll need 15 flying hours.
- Do you hear?
- I'm not deaf.
Well, have we enough gas,
or haven't we?
Yes!
- Are we out of gas?
- Can't be!
Emergency tank.
Had to switch over, that's all.
- I suppose the emergency tank is full.
- Of course.
When we filled up at Wolstenholme,
did you check the emergency tank?
Did you check
the emergency tank?
What difference does it make
whether I checked it or not?
- Well, did you or didn't you?
- Very well then! No!
- You've got us into a mess!
- Don't shout at me!
I'm trying to take control!
We'll make a forced landing if we have to.
Forced landing? What good is that to us?
We're 200 kilometers from the border!
Well, I can't think of everything, can I?
I can't help it if I make a mistake sometimes!
Anyway, you're supposed to be in command!
Why don't you handle the thing yourself?
I wish I could!
- We're going to crash! What should we do?
- Nothing! Hang on!
There's a lake ahead!
- All right! I'm not blind!
- Parachute!
- Sit down!
- We'll never make it! Can't you lift her a little?
- Leave me alone, can't you!
- Any orders,
- Jump!
- No! Sit down!
Hold on tight, everybody.
I'm gonna try something!
That's better. Better.
- Throw something out!
- What?
A cushion! Anything!
I can't see the surface!
- What is —This isn't —
- I can't see!
For God's sake,
tell me what to do!
Out! Out!
- I'll get out,
- Out! Out!
Vogel! Vogel!
All right,
He's dead.
So that's Kuhnecke.
Look out!
It's a woman!
##
- The girl has a German newspaper.
- Why not?
There are half a million of us in Canada.
Vogel, go speak to her. See what you can find out.
Don't try to be too clever.
Keep as near to the truth as you can.
- Hello.
- Mmm.
Why, you're only a kid.
I thought you were much older in that getup.
I'm 16.
Are you looking for work?
Yes. How did you know?
You don't look like a hobo.
- Reaping started?
- Just begun.
- Are you on your own?
- Oh, those. Those are my pals.
- I thought they were your pals.
- Why?
- Seasonal workers always travel in gangs.
Well, these are my pals.
- This is —
- Anna.
Anna. She's 16.
It isn't true. I shouldn't lie.
I shall be 16 the day after tomorrow.
It's only a difference
of two days.
Yes, but Peter says there's no difference at all
between a small lie and a big lie.
- Who is Peter?
- Oh, so you have a leader.
Aren't you coming to the settlement?
There isn't another for eight miles.
I told her we were looking for work.
We should be glad to,
but, uh, there are four of us.
Don't worry. When 111 people sit down for supper,
four more won't make any difference.
Thirty-nine brothers,
Hmm. What are you? Mormons?
Mormons?
No. Hutterites.
I didn't mean we were all one family.
We're only brothers and sisters in God.
Hurry up, boy.
You are a slow boy.
Anna, more bread for our guests.
We're sorry about the bread.
Mmm.
I know a bit about baking.
If you don't mind my saying so,
you ought to get a new baker.
- We had a good one,
but he went to Small Springs.
- Mmm. Better pay?
Pay?
Oh, no one gets paid here.
- Doesn't anyone get paid anything?
- No.
Well, what do you work for, then?
Just your keep?
No. For us all.
What, all these people
work for nothing?
- Yeah.
- What sort of work?
Whatever suits them best.
Well, what do you mean?
They don't choose themselves, do they?
- Haven't you got a leader of the community?
- Yes. There he is over there.
Where?
Which is your leader?
There.
Third from the right.
Well, doesn't he tell the people
what sort of job they've got to do?
Oh, no.
We tell him what  want to do.
Then how can he be your leader?
How do you mean?
Well, anyone works
at whatever job they like, then.
Yeah, that's right.
If somebody can make shoes, he makes shoes.
If he wants to be a blacksmith,
he works in the forge.
If somebody feels he can preach,
well, he preaches.
Well, what's your specialty?
I'm... the baker.
When you sell your stuff in Winnipeg,
what happens to the money?
We buy new tractors, build houses,
found new settlements.
We just founded a new one
over at Small Springs.
And if someone leaves you and then
wants to come back, don't you punish them?
- Punish?
- Yes.
Don't you send them
to a camp or something?
Camp? Why a camp?
No, we just take them back
because our religion tells us to.
- The Hutterite religion?
- The Christian religion.
- ##
- Is it one of your rules to sing like this?
We haven't any rules. We sing because
we like to. It's good for the digestion.
##
Well, good night.
The leader will look after you.
- Thank you.
- What's the salute?
The what?
Don't you give the leader
a salute?
- Good evening, friends.
- Good evening.
On behalf of my friends and myself,
I have to thank you for your kindness...
in giving us food and shelter.
You're welcome.
I hear you come from up north in the woods,
or down north, as we call it here.
Yes.
- Just come out?
- Last week.
Are you Germans?
I ask, are you Germans?
Yes.
Are you ashamed of it?
Of course not.
I'll show you where to sleep.
Anna, I thought you would have
told them all about us.
We mostly discussed birthdays.
Well, it's quite an event with us,
the 16th birthday.
It means that one has grown up at last.
Come in, please.
This house
belonged to Hugo Waldner...
one of our brothers
who has gone to the new settlement.
- At Small Springs?
- Yes.
You see, we are like bees.
If we get too many,
we send out a swarm.
So the house is empty
and at your service.
Good night.
- Sleep well.
Hmm.
That's what I call a busy girl.
It's nothing.
I make 14 beds every night.
That's a lot of work.
We have a lot of men who have no mothers
and who aren't married yet.
- So somebody has to make their beds.
- Quite right.
- Where do you sleep?
- In Peter's house.
- In Peter's house?
- Poor Peter. Why not?
- Because he has a mother to look after him.
No. She was drowned.
Drowned?
In the sea.
When we left Germany...
we went to England...
because we had to wait
until we got a permit to come to Canada.
We got our permit
after war was declared.
Was your father with you?
Wait a minute.
I want to hear about her mother.
Her ship was sunk.
I think so.
Don't you know?
- Was there a big explosion?
Shut up, you two.
You and your questions.
Oh, leave that.
- Run along now.
- I'll take her home.
All right, you take her.
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night.
Chins up.
- Do you think they are friendly,
- Friendly? Yes.
But you saw how their leader
tried to draw us out.
"Are you Germans?
Are you ashamed of being Germans?"
- That in a country with which we are at war.
- There can only be one answer to that.
Our agents have done their work well.
Yes. This religion may be
nothing but a cover.
I bet they sing the "Horst Wessel" song
better than hymns.
We shall see that tomorrow.
Shut the door.
In a few years time, it may be the basis
of compulsory lectures to the Hitler Youth.
The ships we sank,
with women and children aboard...
the lifeboats we shelled —
mmm, we were good at that.
What we did to the Eskimos
at the post...
the unarmed men
we shot in the back.
You forget, Vogel, we're at war.
We can't expect to win
without the methods of total warfare.
Men, women and children — they're all
our enemies and must be treated as such.
Did you never read what Bismarck said?
"Leave them only their eyes to weep with."
"Leave them only their eyes
to weep with."
Did he say that?
A great German.
You know, Vogel,
I'm worried about you.
You're a good fellow,
but you don't discipline yourself.
You could be just as good a Nazi as he is
if you tried.
- Are you listening, Vogel?
Herr Leutnant.
- Then think it over.
Herr Leutnant.
- And get out of bed and turn out the light.
Herr Leutnant.
Vogel, I —
- Either of you seen Vogel?
- No,
- Well, get dressed at once.
-  Good morning, friend.
- Good morning.
He's asking for you.
Oh? All right.
Well? Aren't you going?
Well, I can't go
till I've got this lot ready.
What shall I tell him?
I'll be along in a minute.
Ah.
Now, that's what I call bread.
Cheer up, David.
It took me seven years.
- I didn't want to give it up. I had to.
- You see, we all had —
Good morning, friend.
Mr. Vogel is the best baker
we've had here in 15 years.
Congratulations, Vogel.
It was a good idea.
Round the barn!
What's the news in Winnipeg?
The market was good for geese.
People are asking for Hutterite geese.
I don't like that, Andreas.
No?
For 300 years our brethren
have wandered from place to place...
from country to country...
because of the jealousy of others.
This is a good country, Andreas.
- I met Frau Habermann.
- Yes? Oh, her trial was on today, wasn't it?
Her husband and her eldest son, Eric,
are to be interned. She is free.
Bad luck...
just at harvest time.
It wasn't a good day for the trial.
Papers are full of stories about those Germans
who landed from a U-boat down north.
They seem to have acted like wild beasts,
killing and stealing.
- What's Frau Habermann going to do?
- I had a talk with her.
- She needs help on the farm.
- It'll be difficult.
We'll talk it over. Tell the others
we'll have a meeting tonight, yes?
Air's heavy.
I'm afraid we're going to
have a storm tonight.
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late, Peter.
Barbarina, there's an electric storm
playing all around us...
frightening the animals
and your chickens.
- Move over, Philip.
- Andreas.
- Huh?
- One of our guests is speaking.
- Eh? What? Oh! Good!
We're discussing the Habermanns.
I was about to say...
you have one clear choice.
Where there is a question of blood...
where one is governed
by the deepest of racial instincts...
then every other consideration
is swept aside.
Men like yourself—
German, or of German ancestry—
conscious of the sacred duty
that binds us all together...
and in the knowledge that he
who doesn't forget his people...
will not by his people be forgotten.
There is a new wind
blowing from the east...
a great storm
coming across the sea...
Let those beware who would have
the temerity to stand in its way.
They will go down
before its irresistible impulse...
and be crushed out of existence!
why need I use
these parables of speech any longer?
I mean, all of you here tonight —
yes, you, brothers —
I call you brothers
and proudly acknowledge you as such.
You who formed a little stronghold
of our people here in Canada...
you will have your share
of the happiness and prosperity...
that is waiting for us all
when the storm is over and the sun rises —
that mighty sun —
What sun are you
talking about, friend?
I am talking of
the greatest idea in history—
supremacy of the Nordic race,
the German people.
I am talking of the being whose name
I am certain lives in every heart...
whose name hangs on all our lips...
whether we can shout it to the world
or only whisper it in one another's ears.
Germans!
Brothers!
I ask you to join with me
in paying homage to our glorious führer.
I don't ask where you come from
or what brought you here...
although you've left us
in no doubt as to your beliefs.
Someone has given you,
no doubt deliberately...
a completely false impression of us.
We are only one amongst
many foreign settlements in Canada.
There are thousands of them
in this part of the world.
And they have been founded,
some recently, some 80 years ago...
by people who left their homes
in Europe because of famine...
because of starvation...
because of racial
and political persecution...
and some, like ourselves,
because of their faith.
But all have found here in Canada...
the security...
the peace and tolerance
and understanding...
which, in Europe...
it is your führer's pride
to have stamped out.
You call us brothers.
Yes. Most of us are Germans.
Our names are German.
Our tongue is German.
Our old handwritten books
are in German script.
But we are not your brothers.
Our Germany is dead.
However hard this may be
for some of us older people...
it's a blessing for our children.
Our children grew up against
new backgrounds, new horizons.
And they are free...
free to grow up as children...
free to run and to laugh
without being forced into uniforms...
without being forced to march
up and down the streets...
singing battle songs.
You talk about a new order in Europe.
The new order...
where there will not be one corner...
not a hole big enough for a mouse...
where a decent man can breathe freely.
It is against our faith to hate.
We only hate the power of evil
which is spreading over the world.
You and your Hitlerism...
are like the microbes
of some filthy disease...
filled with a longing
to multiply yourselves...
until you destroy everything
healthy in the world.
No.
We are not your brothers.
What do you want?
I am come to tell you that
you can make your own beds.
I don't want to work for you.
You're Nazis, aren't you?
Aren't you?
We're not allowed to hate anybody.
But I hate you.
I believed you'd escaped
from an internment camp.
I should tell the police about you.
You killed my father...
because he said your führer
was the Antichrist.
You drowned my mother.
I hate you.
I hate you!
So you're going to tell
the police about us, are you?
Little girls should be seen
and not heard.
- That will do.
- What's the matter with you?
- Vogel.
Come along, Anna.
I'll take you home.
we can't let them go.
- I'd like to see what you're
going to do about it.
- Vogel!
- Yes,
Have you forgotten who you are?
Herr Leutnant.
- Let the girl go and shut the door.
I'll take her home,
Is that you, Anna?
Yes, Peter.
I brought Anna home.
She's all right.
We're going now,
perhaps in a few minutes.
I only wanted to say that
you've been kind and I like it here.
You like my bread,
and I like the way you live.
Being with you has made me feel
like it used to be at home.
I'd almost forgotten
what it was like...
baking bread,
doing my real work.
That's how it used to be seven years ago
before everything changed.
The life I've been living
seems to have no sense in it now.
Well, I'd better go now.
Please don't go.
- Are they still talking?
- Hush, child. Go to sleep.
How can a man like you, Vogel —
I mean, you're a simple,
good human being.
How can you get mixed up
with such a lot of gangsters?
What can you do?
When you're a boy,
you like playing soldiers.
When you're a young man, you can't
get work unless you belong to them.
When you're an old man,
you're anxious not to lose what you've got.
But there are thousands
of men like you, Vogel...
men who don't like
the way things are going.
I suppose so.
I suppose they don't know
themselves. I didn't know.
It's as if a blind man said
he doesn't know the sun shines.
- I suppose so.
- Why don't you stay with us, Vogel?
- Do you mean it?
- Of course I mean it.
Even if you know who I am,
where I come from—
I don't care who you are
or where you come from.
- I know you.
- Thank you, Peter.
- It will mean internment.
- What's it matter?
I'll come back after the war.
This is your home.

You are accused of desertion
and treachery to the Third Reich.
The sentence will be carried out
immediately in the name of the führer.
"Investigations by the R.C.M. P
have resulted in finding the remains
of a Canadian Airways sea plane...
- Give me the glasses.
- What for?
- Food.
- You can't eat them.
I can sell them.
- They're his.
- Come on, come on.
They belong to the fatherland.
It wouldn't let us starve, would it?
Congratulations, Lohrmann.
No field glass has ever
had a better end.
We shall view the future
better through these.
-  How much did he give you?
- Seven dollars.
Well, what are you waiting for?
You saw what the bulletin said.
They're watching the border.
But they don't know there are only three of us.
They still think there are five.
The police aren't fools.
They'll find out soon enough.
If we're caught, it won't matter
whether there are three or five or 10 of us.
We're going to change our plans.
We're going to Vancouver.
Vancouver?
AJapanese ship leaves
Vancouver in a month's time.
- Is it far to Vancouver?
- About 2,000 kilometers.
- We can never get as far as that.
- The führer has never admitted the word "can't."
Neither should we.
Our one consideration
must be how to get to —
- How to get home.
Doesn't matter how we do it,
but we will get home.
That's how he works.
He says that it's Germany's
destiny to rule Europe.
Doesn't matter how she achieves
that destiny, but she will achieve it.
He gave me this.
These Canadians give everything away.
The road west is plain enough.
Follow the River Assiniboine for 50 miles.
Do we start now,
No. No, we sleep tonight
in the railway station.
Tomorrow we'll catch a bus
outside the city limits, then walk.
He wanted us to fly to Vancouver.
Said it would save a lot of time.
-  What did you say,
- I said we had plenty of time.
is plenty of kilometers.
Those are the Three Sisters Mountains.
Today's Indian Day.
It's the biggest crowd of the year.
There will be thousands of Indians.
You should stop over and see it.
I have an appointment in Vancouver.
You say these three men were here?
Well, they were right here.
- Can you describe them?
- Well, let me see, now.
- There's only one that
I would remember right well.
- Corporal.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Attention please.
They are not ordinary aliens,
escaped from Kananaskis Internment Camp.
They are survivors
from a German submarine...
Each one of you,
look closely at your neighbor.
These are descriptions of the three men.
One, who appears to be the leader...
There is no very good description
of the second man.
He may be carrying a bulky rucksack.
The third man is short and dark.
He wears no hat.
He has a tweed jacket and a bow tie.
He carries a parcel wrapped
in oilcloth and tied with thick string.
He is described as being
nervous in his manner.
I must ask all of you to stay
exactly where you are...
and not talk or move.
All of you, as citizens, can help
to bring these men to justice.
Each one of you,
look closely at your neighbor.
it's a trail.
Hmm, come on then.
Lost?
- Yes.
- That's a difficult trail on foot in those outfits.
- Yes.
- Any plans?
- Plans?
Well, it'll be dark in an hour.
The moon doesn't rise till 11:00.
A lot of grizzlies on that trail.
- Grizzlies?
You wouldn't like 'em.
And they wouldn't like you.
I see.
- Ah, dinner. You're just in time.
George will be pleased.
Tricky things, aren't they?
The great thing is just to sit still.
- On holiday here?
- Yes, on holiday.
How do you find the lodge?
They used to do you a very good
lobster thermidor with a red Bordeaux.
They still do you a lobster,
but no more red Bordeaux.
- A nuisance, isn't it?
- Hmm?
Of course one knows one half of humanity
is trying to wipe out the other half, but...
up here among the mountains
and the spruce forests...
one sees it in perspective.
So that it —
it seems almost unimportant.
You've chosen a very beautiful place
for your holiday.
Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it?
Actually, I'm here to work... on a book.
- Oh, so you're a novelist?
Then I — I suppose
you were at Banff today.
For Indian Day? No, no, no.
That's just for tourists.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Ship ahoy!
Well, gentlemen.
Welcome to my humble tepee.
And tell Bob
two more for dinner. Well.
It must be very pleasant
roughing it up here in the mountains.
Yes, I rather like
pigging it occasionally.
I hope you won't mind
taking potluck with me.
Here, have a cigarette.
Ah, I see you're looking at my Picasso.
It's nice, isn't it?
Here.
How do you feel about Matisse?
I picked these up about a year ago,
and I can't bear to be parted from them.
How do you like it, hmm?
- Excellent.
-
I don't think you two are
really interested in pictures.
Well, my motto is,
wars may come and wars may go...
but art goes on forever.
Ah, you like reading, don't you?
Have you seen Hemingway's latest?
Here. I'm going to
show you one of my pets.
There. Thomas Mann,
This is the German edition.
This is wonderful stuff.
By the way, do you speak German?
Have you read this book?
Thomas Mann is very good, I believe.
I'm so sorry. Of course,
you'll want a bath after your long climb.
I'm afraid I can only offer you a shower.
Come on. I'll show you the way.
- Thank you very much, Mr. —
- Scott.
Philip Armstrong Scott. Come on.
Philip Armstrong Scott.
Ah, hot water.
I feel completely confident tonight.
If we'd twice as far to go,
I wouldn't worry now.
What could these
weaklings ever do to us?
The man's country's at war
and look at him.
I tell you, Lohrmann,
they're rotten to the core.
There's no fight in them.
They're soft and degenerate all through.
No, I'll have cold.
Yes, I've discovered some rather
amusing things during my researches.
Blackfoot tribal customs,
for instance, closely resemble those...
of a certain modern
European tribe.
I'm gonna read you
something about that.
Where are we?
"From the earliest age, their small boys
were trained in the arts of war...
"which they considered to be
the only pursuit worthy of a man.
"Their smaller neighbors lived
in constant danger from them.
"They also believed in first
terrorizing their opponent...
by covering themselves in war paint
and beating loudly on their tribal drums."
Well, doesn't that sound
familiar to you?
Familiar?
- Well, what price Goebbels, eh?
- Very similar.
- Yeah, you see, don't you?
And listen to this.
This is wonderful.
Come here, sit down.
Uh, oh, yes.
"When a tribal leader really
desired to drive a point home...
"he used that most terrible of all
public speaker's weapons: Repetition...
constant and unutterably
wearisome repetition."
Old man Hitler himself.
- What's wrong?
- I think he found it a little warm in here.
I'm so sorry.
- Well, rather stuffy in there, eh?
- A little.
Lovely night, isn't it?
The moon's just out.
- We're not the only ones up, I see.
- The men, eh?
- When do they go to bed?
Oh, pretty early as a rule.
They please themselves.
You must be rather tired yourself.
How about a nightcap
before you turn in?
- Thank you.
- Yes.
Well. Interested?
Have a drink?
Well, happy dreams.
Ah, I thought you'd find it a bit chilly.
We're 6,000 feet up here, you know?
- So you think you'll escape the war, Mr. Scott?
- Hmm?
- That's not a very nice way of putting it.
- But you'll do your best to escape it.
Do you mean I'm —
I wonder if I am.
I don't think I'm a coward.
I've never really been in any great danger.
I don't exactly know how I'd behave.
- I can imagine how you'd behave.
I said, "I can imagine how you'd behave."
Well, you are an extraordinary fellow.
You're certainly frank.
So you despise my mode of life, eh?
I imagined you'd been thinking,
"Here's a nice, decent sort of chap.
Amiable.
Full of interesting conversation."
And instead of that,
you think I'm —
Go on, what do you think I am?
This ought to be enlightening.
If you were a real man,
you'd have struck me across the face
when I suggested you were a coward.
Instead of which, you talk about it.
Well, why not?
I may write about the customs
of red Indians 200 years ago...
but I don't have to behave like one.
After all, we've been given
reasoning powers and the gift of speech.
Why don't we use them
instead of hitting each other?
Come on, have a cigarette.
I don't think you're even a coward.
I don't think you're a man at all.
You must've had too much to drink.
You both better get to bed.
Is this gun loaded?
Of course it's loaded.
Then put your hands up.
- What do you mean?
- It's quite plain. Put them up.
Well, well, well.
This is a new experience.
So I've been entertaining gangsters.
Well, what do you want?
Money or what?
You don't believe
we'd shoot you, do you?
Such a thing couldn't happen
to Mr. Philip Armstrong Scott.
Anything unpleasant must be
kept as far away as possible...
as far as the war,
Suppose I was to tell you that
the war is right here in this tent?
I don't suppose you've heard of
the U-boat that was sunk in Hudson Bay
and the six Germans who escaped.
So that's who you are — Nazis.
Well, that explains everything.
Your arrogance, your stupidity,
your bad manners —
Get over there by your books!
Oh, dear. Do I have to be tied up?
Excuse us, Mr. Scott.
We still employ savage, tribal methods.
They get results.
The best thing that's
happened to us is meeting you.
You've put the heart back into us.
There are only two of us now.
Two out of six brave men.
There are millions like us in Germany.
Any more of your sort here,
you don't stand a chance of
winning this war. We'll see to that.
- Get the clothes out of there.
- Well, they won't suit you.
Not much there, I'm afraid.
- Thirty-three dollars.
- Do I get a receipt?
Interesting.
So far, I don't feel the least afraid.
No sign of trembling.
Pulse appears to be quite steady.
Mouth a bit dry perhaps.
Here. Rifles.
Ah, you feel happier now, don't you?
Look out.
Wars may come and wars may go,
but art goes on forever, eh?
Stop!
Thomas Mann.
Yes, I have read this book.
We kicked this swine
out of the Reich years ago.
Think yourself lucky
we don't burn you too.
Well, I never would've believed
that grown-up men...
could behave like
spiteful little schoolboys.
Have I said something to annoy you?
Then, I forget,
anything reasonable annoys you.
- Open your mouth.
- One question, please.
When Hitler's making a speech,
just exactly what are your rea —
Damn them horses.
Stampeded again.
- There. There they go.
This way.
Who's been leaving a saddle out here?
Confound it!
Here's another one.
Boss must've gone crazy.
You've made a fine mess of things.
You've roused the whole camp.
The horses were your idea.
I knew they'd give trouble.
- You forget yourself, Lohrmann.
- Save your breath, Hirth.
Hirth! Not that way!
- Who are you talking to?
- You're not my superior officer now.
- Obey orders and follow me!
- Orders be —
All right.
Come on, George. Art! Art!
-
- What's happened, Boss?
- A holdup. Those two fellas —
- No!
- Yes.
-
- Oh, there's one of them.
- Good old George.
- Looks like he's lost it.
- Confound it.
He's got it, the old bloodhound.
Come on.
- Which one of them two is it, Boss?
- I don't know. Did you see, George?
All right, George?
I forgot to tell you, Art.
He's got my Colt, too.
See that hole?
That's gonna cost him seven bucks
before I let the Mounties get him.
That means he's got four shots left.
- Okay, Boss, but I don't think
you ought to take any—
- Let me stay with you, Mr. Scott.
- The papers say these men are killers.
- Yes, the Canadian papers.
The Nazi papers call them heroes.
Two brave Nazis
against 11 million Canadians.
Say, Mr. Scott.
Mr. Scott.
One.
- Two.
- Three.
- Four.
That's the lot.
All right, you can fetch him out now.
You all right, Boss?
Well, you can't expect me to capture
an armed Nazi without getting hurt a little.
- Yet —
- Here. Let me have a look at that.
The boss has knocked him cold.
Well, he had a fair chance.
One armed superman...
against one unarmed decadent democrat.
I wonder how Dr. Goebbels
will explain that.
"wherever you may be
on the North American continent...
"I hail you as the paladin
of the Third Reich...
"and the upholder of the honor
of the great German people.
"By express order
of the führer himself...
"you have today been invested
with the iron cross, first class.
Heil Hitler."
"Flash: Lethbridge, Alberta.
Mounted police pick up
trail of escaping Nazi.
"At Lethbridge Airport, Kenyon Field...
"it's been established that a man
resembling the wanted man...
"The hearts of all sympathizers with
the German cause go out to
"One man against 11 million.
"They know that even now,
the odds are not too heavy...
"when the one man represents
the might of the Third Reich...
and the 11 million,
a collapsing democracy."
"Forty-eight hours have elapsed
and still Lieutenant Ernst Hirth...
"the only surviving Nazi
from the U-37, is at large.
"The whole world's eyes
are on southern Ontario.
The question of the hour is:
Where is Hirth?"
You'll be okay here. I'll let you know
when you get to the falls.
Yes.
You needn't be afraid of me.
I won't split on you.
I'm not afraid.
Looks like you got a nice private car.
Have a cigarette.
Sit down.
Thank you.
- Comin' from Toronto?
- Yes.
- Livin' there, maybe?
- No.
- Quite a place, Toronto.
- I didn't see much of it.
- Are you from the west?
- Well, I've been there.
- Vancouver?
- Yes.
That must be a beautiful city, Vancouver.
I didn't stay there long either.
- You don't stay long anywhere, do you?
- Well, I travel about a good deal.
Travel about.
That's a lot of fun.
When I was a kid, I had the big idea
to see the whole of Canada.
But things don't work out
the way you think.
I save a bit of money,
and what do I do?
Put it in my pocket and
start off down the road...
my own boss, with the whole
of Canada in front of me?
Not on your life.
I buy a bit of land up Beamsville way.
And that keeps me so busy,
that's about all of Canada I see.
Have a shot of Ontario wine.
Catawba.
I send the grapes to the winery
from my own farm.
- Sherry-type.
- Thank you.
Got a kick like a mule.
Where was I? Oh, yeah.
Sometimes I think I'll take a holiday.
But do I take a holiday?
Not a bit of it.
- I take a wife.
Say, were there any M.P.'s around
while you've been here?
- M.P.'s?
- Military police.
- Are you in trouble with the police?
- Not exactly what you'd call trouble.
I just don't wanna
meet 'em, that's all.
- Are you a soldier?
- Well, that's a matter of opinion.
That's what I joined up to be.
The government said,
"We want men to fight the Nazis. Join today."
So I joined.
I figured they were in a hurry.
That was 387 days ago.
Four divisions and a lot of drafts
have gone overseas...
and what's Number B-987642 doing?
Guardin' the Chippewa Canal.
Who'd wanna steal it anyway?
Well, I guess I better climb
back into my battle rompers.
Do you think your government
have treated you badly?
I enlisted to knock hell out of the Nazis.
I'm about as close to getting my hands
on a Jerry now as I was at the beginning.
Holy mackinaw,
beef, three times a day.
Haven't tasted parsnips
since I joined the army.
- I'm fond of parsnips, too.
- Why are you afraid of the police?
Who's afraid of the police?
I just overstayed my leave eight days.
That is a serious offense in wartime.
- You're a deserter.
Deserter, my royal Canadian foot.
I'm just independent.
You're a deserter because
you have a legitimate grievance
against your democratic government.
Say, where did you pick up
those five-gallon words?
You have a good suit.
Sure, it's a good suit.
Paid 25 bucks for it two years ago.
- It's a very good suit.
Just now, most of the boys
are wearin' these.
Yes.
- Well, I'm a son of a —
- Stand up.
Put your hands up.
Stand over there.
Unless you're anxious to be shot,
you won't move.
I'm perfectly ready
to kill you or anyone else.
Yeah, I can see you are.
- Fourteen drums of carbide.
- Don't move.
- Who's movin'?
Nine cans germicide.
Okay.
Everything checks all right.
Okay, then seal her up.
Now look what you done.
I am a deserter now.
- What do you mean?
- They're taking us clear out of the country.
- Out of the country?
- Into the States. We're crossin' the border now.
Into America?
Heil Hitler.
- You dirty Nazi.
- Yes, I'm a Nazi. Heil Hitler.
- One of them off the U-boat.
- Quite right, my friend.
In two minutes,
I shall be across the border.
Once there were six of us.
Now I represent them all.
Field Marshall Göring has said...
"It doesn't matter as long as we have
only one plane and one man left,
so long as victory is ours."
- Do you hear that?
We've beaten these dirty democracies,
these weaklings.
I tell you, we've something inside us...
something beyond the dim, muddied
minds of you in the democracies.
that unite me with every German Aryan?
When I step on American soil,
I shall not be alone.
-
- It is not the Canadian people we're against.
It's your filthy government,
the whole democratic system.
You don't like it any more than I do.
You don't like the job they've given you.
- You don't like the food. You said so yourself.
- Why, you spoon-fed louse.
I can grouse about the food and the C.O.
And anything I blame please.
And that's more than you with your
Gestapo and your storm troopers
and your Aryan bourgeois.
Aw, nuts.
What's the good of talkin' to you?
We own the right to be fed up
with anything we damn please...
and say so out loud when we feel like it.
And when things go wrong,
we can take it.
We can dish it out too.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- You check and I'll mark.
Go on and wrestle some boxes.
It'll be good for you.
Yeah, sure, sure.
Hey.
Who are you two?
- I'm Andrew Brock,
Canadian Active Service Force.
- You don't look it. And you?
- We're on American territory?
- Yes.
I am Ernst Hirth, a German citizen. I demand
to be taken to the nearest German consulate.
Don't do it. Send him back.
He's an escaping Nazi.
He slugged me.
That's my uniform.
- Hey, this gun is loaded.
- No.
By your American law,
you must take me to my consul.
- Is that right?
- I'm afraid it is.
- He's one of that gang off
the German submarine, the U-37.
- On the level?
I am  of the German Navy
and also a German citizen. And I demand —
You've got to send him back.
He's not just an escaping Nazi. He's important.
The whole German nation is waiting
to see if he can get away with it.
- I know. I read the papers.
- Hey, couldn't we sort of—You know?
- You mean?
- Yeah.
No.
- By your own law, you must take me to my consul.
- Sometimes I think we got too many laws.
- Don't let him pull that law stuff!
- You know better than that, soldier.
I'm a customs inspector.
This is for the immigration department.
My job's inspecting and checking
on freights and imports.
Listen, Captain. What would you do
if he were an illegal shipment of... cheese?
- At least he's a Nazi.
- He's not on the manifest, is he?
- I said, "He's not on the manifest."
- No.
- No.
- No, he's not.
- The American law —
- Aw, shut up.
- How do you check?
- Same way. Two unlisted items.
But your law refers to freight,
not to persons.
This is a freight car,
and you're freight.
- Tell the engineer to return this car.
- Okay.
- Check.
Thanks, Colonel. Thanks a million.
We've all got to do our duty, soldier.
- I'll send your gun back to the Mounties.
- Okay. I don't need it.
I protest. You cannot do this.
It's illegal.
Sonny boy, I've done it.
Hello, Macaulay? It's Eddie speakin'.
We're sendin' back car number 8772.
Gee, you guys are gettin' careless.
There's two items not in the manifest.
- Now, either list 'em or take 'em off.
Put 'em up, Nazi.
No, not that way. This way.
'Cause I'm not askin' for those pants.
I'm just takin' 'em.
