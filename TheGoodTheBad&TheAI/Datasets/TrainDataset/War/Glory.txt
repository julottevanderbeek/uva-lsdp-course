One! One!
One, two, one!
"Dear Mother.
I hope you are keeping well...
You mustn't think that any of us
are going to be killed...
for they are collecting
such a force here...
The Massachusetts men
passed through here this morning.
How grand it is to meet the men
from all the states, east and west...
as the old fellows did
in the Revolution.
But this time we must make it
a whole country...
for all who live here,
so that all can speak.
many of my regiment
had never seen a Negro.
Now the roads are choked
with the dispossessed.
whose poetry is not yet written,
but which will presently...
be as enviable
and as renowned as any.
Last night we heard
of yet another defeat.
I am honored to be part
of such a splendid company.
They have made me captain,
of which I am enormously proud.
You would think it strange to see me
giving orders to a hundred men...
Thank you for sending
my volume of Emerson.
His words come home to me
like truth...
'A deep man, ' he says, 'believes
that the evil eye can wither...
that the heart's blessing
can heal...
and that love
can overcome all odds. '
Charge!
Company, forward!
Charge!
Company, forward!
- Charge!
- Fire!
Fire!
Aim!
Fire!
Stand. Fire!
Steady, boys!
- Forward!
- Fire!
Forward, men!
For God's sake, come on!
Robert, come on!
We must fall back!
No! Forbes!
Forbes!
Charge!
Fire!
You all right there, Captain?
Please! Not my leg!
- Where's the chloroform?
- Stop!
Stop!
No! Wait!
- No!
- Hold on!
So it's your neck?
The surgeons are busy,
but I'll fix you up.
- Let me know if I hurt you.
- Stop!
Ah, this is nothing.
- Heard the latest?
- What's that?
I heard it from a friend
who's a dispatch rider...
who got it from one of Stanton's clerks
in the War Office.
He says Lincoln is gonna issue
an emancipation proclamation.
Gonna free the slaves.
- What?
- Maybe not in the border states...
but he will free some, anyway.
My God.
He said he would have done it sooner,
only he was waiting for a big vicfory...
which is, I guess, what this is.
Oh, my God!
Please don't cut anymore, please!
Please!
This might hurt you, Captain.
I'm sorry.
Dashing.
- Robert.
- Thomas.
Captain Shaw.
I was so proud when I heard.
They had no choice.
All the other officers are dead.
- And Forbes?
- Impossible, as always.
He's here somewhere.
How about you?
Working for your father,
helping him with the resettlement...
for the Freedmen's Relief Association.
There's a shortage of housing.
Robert! Are you all right?
Yes. I'm sorry.
Darling, there's someone
who wishes to meet you.
General Hunter rounded up
a bunch of slaves...
called them contraband
and put them in camps like cattle.
The War Department decided
to issue them pikes rather than guns.
Ot course they deserted.
So would I.
Robert. Governor,
you know my son Robert.
- Good to see you again.
- Governor Andrew.
Robert, have you met
Frederick Douglass?
Mr. Douglass.
I understand you were at Antietam.
A great and a terrible day.
I could use your help.
The governor is proposing to raise
a regiment of Negro soldiers.
No. It was not just my idea.
Mr. Douglass...
We will offer pride and dignity...
to those who have known
only degradation.
- Colored soldiers. Just think of it.
- Wonderful.
I've submitted your name
to be commissioned colonel...
of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry.
Thank you, Governor.
That's...
It's a wondertul idea.
Excuse me.
Well done, Shaw.
- Splendid job, young man.
- Bravo, Robert.
What's the matter?
Too much punch?
I know how much you'd like to
make colonel, but a colored regiment?
You know how popular that would be?
Handing out guns
to a thousand coloreds?
Hey, Robert.
What's wrong?
I'm gonna do it.
You're not serious.
- I want you to come with me.
- Me?
And you?
Can you picture me
in charge of a regiment?
Picture me in charge of anything.
I would be honored to have you.
Then you're an idiot.
Rob, is it true?
There's to be a colored regiment?
So it seems.
Then I am your first volunteer.
Present arms!
How do we look, Colonel?
We gonna whup the Secess'?
When do we get the blue suit?
Yeah, the blue suit.
Ready to whip them Rebs.
When are we gonna get to fight?
Are we really gonna get to fight
this time?
Attention!
Morning.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw.
I am your commanding officer.
It is a great pleasure
to see you all here today.
It is my hope that the same courage...
spirit and honor...
which has brought us together...
will one day restore this Union.
May God bless us all!
Form companies?
We will commence
with forming companies.
Company officers, take charge.
You recruits will report
to your respective officers...
by the letter of your company
in alphabetical order...
which is in the top left-hand corner
of your muster sheet.
- Good book, brother?
- Yes, it is, actually.
Name's Searles. Thomas Searles.
Jupiter Sharts, sir.
What it about, that book?
It's a collection of essays...
Fourier, Emerson...
all the transcendentalists.
It got pictures?
- Teach me?
- Yes, I'd be happy to.
Look at what's walking in here!
I'd rather have a hog
than a nigger.
- At least you could eat the hog!
- Getting dark mighty early around here.
Show us a little dance,
nigger boys!
Sergeant of the Guard,
post your sentry.
Yes, sir!
Wait, no. That's my space, nigger.
I sleep better close by the door.
I prefer a space
with more reading light.
Oh, I like it when niggers
talk good as white folk.
I'd be happy to teach you.
It would be my pleasure.
Look, snowflake, I ain't got nothing
to learn from no house nigger.
I am a free man,
as was my father.
Good. Move your free black ass
before I bust it up.
- Hey, hold up, buck.
- Nobody said nothing to you, pap.
It's all right.
I'll be fine over here.
- Mm-hmm.
- Excuse me.
Wonder when they gonna
give us the blue suit.
Ain't no blue suit for the black
soldiers. Blue suits for the whites.
Well, we soldiers now.
Where you from, field hand?
South Carolina.
You ought to know better, boy.
Hey, would you quit that?
Say, boy, quit that drumming.
What's your name?
I said what's your name, boy?
- Can't you see that he's mute?
- He what?
He's mute.
You mean this child can't talk?
Hey, come over here, hon.
Dummies and field hands.
Ain't that a bitch?
What about you, buck?
Whereabouts you from?
I'm from around Tennessee.
Ran away when I was 12 years old,
and I ain't never look back.
What you doing since then?
I run for president.
I didn't win though.
Boy.
Major? Forbes.
That's you.
- Thomas.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- You know Charlie Morse.
- Thomas Searles.
- Captain.
So how was your meal?
The remoulade was a trifle tart...
but the souffle for dessert
more than made up for it.
And your comrades?
Charming. Extraordinary
conversationalists, every one.
Major Forbes!
- A word, please.
- Oh, excuse me, Thomas.
Yes, Robert?
I won't permit
that kind of fraternization.
- It's only Thomas.
- He's an enlisted man.
You're right, of course.
I've sent for help.
These men need a proper teacher.
For God's sake, you march like
a bunch of crippled old goats!
We're gonna be here day and night
till we get this right!
One, one. Company, halt.
About-face!
You are ugly Mexican-African
fucking whores!
We're gonna work on this
day and night, gentlemen!
Forward at the half step. March!
One! You half-wit black bastard.
Is it true they cut your balls off
at birth?
I'll work on you
till I get you broken.
Company, halt!
Do you not know your right
from your left?
No, sir.
How many here do not know
right from left?
Jesus, have pity.
This is your front!
This is your rear!
This is your right! And this...
Now you're learning, boy-o.
Company, forward march!
One!
- Two!
- One! Two!
You bloody Hindus, get it right!
Stop. Start it again.
In each rank! Count!
Left. Left, right, left!
Right, forward, march!
Left. Get your goddamn hand
out of your pocket!
Bonny Prince Charlie!
Are you a gentleman?
Are you a member of congress
or something?
Or are you the bloody
prince of Africa?
Don't look at me!
Look straight ahead!
I'll heat your ass up, boy-o!
The Irish are not noted
for their fondness for the coloreds.
What about the uniforms?
Still no word.
Rifles?
See to it.
You're a big buck, aren't you?
You've got a lot to learn!
You haven't had a master like me!
"Dear Mother.
The men learn very quickly.
Faster than white troops,
it seems to me.
They are almost grave
and sedate under instruction...
But the moment they are dismissed
from drill...
every tongue is relaxed
and every ivory tooth is visible...
and you would not know from the sound
of it that this is an army camp.
They must have learned this from long
hours of meaningless, inhuman work...
There is no doubt
that we will leave this state...
as fine a regiment
as any that has marched.
They've done it.
Assemble the men.
Attention!
Attention!
Battalion!
In accordance with
President Lincoln's wishes...
you men are advised...
that the Confederate Congress
has issued a proclamation.
It reads:
"Any Negro taken in arms...
against the Confederacy...
will immediately be returned
to a state of slavery.
Any Negro taken in Federal uniform...
will be summarily put to death.
Any white officer taken
in command of Negro troops...
shall be deemed as inciting
servile insurrection...
and shall likewise be put to death."
Full discharges will be granted
in the morning...
to all those who apply.
Dismissed.
It you're not here in the morning...
I understand.
Still want that blue suit, nigger?
- Good morning, Major.
- Sir! Formed and ready, sir.
How many are left?
Attention!
Battalion!
Glory hallelujah.
Company, halt!
You're not dismissed, boy-o!
Get up!
You'll fall out when I say
and not before. Understand? Get up!
Sergeant Major.
- Sir!
- At ease, Sergeant.
I have no doubt
that you are a fair man, Mulcany.
I wonder if you are
treating these men too hard.
You disagree.
- You may speak freely.
- The boy's your friend, is he?
We grew up together, yes.
Let him grow up some more.
- I see.
- Will that be all, sir?
Dismissed.
.57 caliber Enfield rifle musket.
Best in the world here, boy.
Sharts.
One, one, nine, one, one.
Can you handle that?
I can knock something down
with this.
Trip.
One, two, one, nine, two.
- Beautiful.
- Hawkins.
One, two, one, eight, six.
- Jefterson.
- Yes, sir!
Robert.
Finally.
There's a rumor going around...
that we're to be used
only for manual labor.
I can't believe the things we hear.
It's not true, is it? I mean,
about not being allowed to fight.
The men are living for that day.
I know I am.
- Fletch.
- Don't bother about him.
- He's just ignorant.
- Excuse me.
For God's sake, come on!
- Good shot!
- Do that again!
Give him your weapon.
Do that again.
- One dime he can't do it.
- Dime on each of you!
That's a bet!
Go on, boy.
Go ahead, Sharts.
- That's a dime on each of you!
- Double or nofhing!
Attention, company!
Attention, company!
As you were.
Front and center.
You are a good shot, Private.
Thank you, sir.
Squirrel hunting.
- You ever killed a man?
- No, sir.
- But you're handy with a gun.
- Yes, sir.
Reload.
Faster.
Faster.
Discharge your weapon.
Discharge your weapon.
Do it!
Now, do it again. Only this time,
I want it done quickly.
A good man can fire three aimed shots
in a minute.
Major Forbes, give me
your Colt revolver.
- What?
- Your gun.
Give it to me.
Faster.
Reload.
Quickly. Faster!
Faster! Load.
Do it! Do it!
Teach them properly, Major.
Yes, sir.
Attention, company!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Good morning, Major.
You're up early.
I want to talk to you.
Certainly.
If you wouldn't mind
getting down from your horse.
- Better?
- Why do you treat the men this way?
How should I treat them?
Like men?
And what about Thomas?
Why are you so hard on him?
He's not a very good soldier.
I'm getting these men ready for battle.
Robert, they're already as good
as the Seventh ever was.
They march well.
They're disciplined.
- No thanks to you.
- I beg your pardon?
You heard me.
Who do you think you are,
acting the high-up colonel?
You seem to forget I know you
and so does Thomas.
If you don't believe in
what we're doing here...
maybe you shouldn't be part of it.
Part of what?
Huh?
Left, right! Little finger
along the seams of your trousers?
Marching is probably all
they'll ever get to do, Robert.
It is my job...
to get these men ready.
And I will.
They have risked their lives to be here.
They have given up their freedom.
I owe them as much as they have given.
I owe them my freedom...
my life, if necessary.
Maybe so do you, Cabot.
I think you do.
Develop! En garde.
Thrust! Develop!
You're not at dancing school!
Take his head off!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What have we here?
Bonny Prince Charlie
and his toy bayonet.
You're not reading now.
Go on. Get over!
- Now stab me.
- What?
Stab me.
Come on. Stab! Not tickle.
Hit me!
Come on! You prissy schoolgirl!
You're the worst soldier
in this company! Hit me!
No shame, son. Get up.
- I said get up!
- Nigger forgot to duck. That's all.
Sergeant, deal with that man.
I'll tell you a wee secret, son.
Learn to keep your mouth shut.
Save it, son.
Save it.
Carry on, Sergeant Mulcany.
Robert.
I'd like to speak to you
for a moment in private, it I may.
Enlisted men wishing to speak
to their commanding officer...
must first get permission.
You understand, Private?
Yes, sir.
En garde! Thrust! Develop! Recover!
You better put some oomph
into that, boy-o!
Oh, my, my, my.
Some things never change.
I guess the whole world
hate the nigger.
Boy, if you don't quit
that drumming in here...
Honey, why don't you take your drum
on outside and practice?
That Colonel Shaw, he a hard man.
He a swell.
Just a nigger-beating swell.
But he in the same boat
with us.
Secess' come, take him, kill him too.
Huh. Not him.
He a swell.
He just a boy.
He a weak white boy.
Beating on a nigger
make him feel strong.
Ain't that right, snowflake?
You know, he ain't never been
to no West Point.
Onliest reason he in charge
is 'cause his mommy and daddy fixed it.
Ain't that so?
You thought he was different,
didn't you?
Hmm?
What you think now?
You just thought you was so smart,
didn't you?
You in the real school now, though,
ain't you?
What you gonna do? Cry?
Yeah. He sure enough learning now,
ain't he?
Attention, company!
Forward, march!
Right face.
Oh, shit.
Man say there's a farm,
ain't but two or three miles from here.
Said the lady over there
give him biscuits and gravy.
She said, if he bring his friends,
she feed them too.
- Don't even think about it.
- What you say, Buck?
Biscuits and gravy sound good to me.
Maybe get myself some real shoes.
I'm telling you, boy.
They find out, they liable to shoot you.
Nigger, is you a old man or old woman?
I forget.
All right.
Collard greens.
Corn bread.
Come on. Dream.
I'm waiting on you.
"Dear Mother. News today
of the defeat at Fredericksburg.
If things continue to go badly,
I wonder if I might not end my days...
as an outlaw leader
of a band of fugitive slaves.
Try as I may,
I don 't know these men...
I am placed in a position where,
if I were a man of real strength...
But I am afraid I shall show
that I'm not of much account.
I don't want to stand in their way
because of my own weakness.
I miss Christmas on the Shaw Island
and the smell of the sea."
It's Thomas.
I just wanted to say...
I wanted to say...
Merry Christmas, Robert.
Merry Christmas, Thomas.
You're Shaw, aren't you?
Merry Christmas.
Kendrick, division quartermaster.
This sorry piece of work is Haggis.
He writes vouchers.
Pleasure.
- How's it going down there?
- Oh, very well. Thank you.
That's all right. Brass are all up
to Division, planning the next disaster.
You're among friends.
How much longer do you figure
they'll last?
I hear they're deserting
ten at a time.
Oh, you're misinformed.
We haven't had a single incident.
I figure the nigs never had it so good.
Three square a day,
a roof over their heads.
They gotta know nobody's
gonna let them fight. Am I right?
Yes, of course.
It there's anything you need...
a bottle for the cold nights...
Actually, I put in a requisition
for shoes two weeks ago...
and I haven't heard anything.
Well, provisionally speaking...
we're extremely limited as to footwear.
That kind of item has to be reserved...
for those units
whose fighting readiness...
supersede yours.
You understand.
Yes, I understand.
- Excuse me.
- Stop by tomorrow.
I have got the most delicious
local jam. Myrtle berry, isn't it?
- Blueberry.
- Right, right.
Nice meeting you, Shaw.
Twit.
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?
We've caught a deserter.
Oh, Lordy, this is bad.
They ain't gonna shoot him, is they?
Lt'll be all right...
won't it?
Re-form your ranks!
- Re-form your ranks!
- Form your ranks!
Fall in.
Quiet in the ranks.
Quiet in the ranks!
Untie his hands
and take off his coat.
The prisoner is in position, sir.
What is this?
The prisoner is to be flogged
before the entire regiment.
Robert, not with a whip.
Not on them.
- Excuse us, Sergeant Mulcany.
- At your pleasure, Colonel.
Never question my authority
in front of ofhers.
Well, I is sorry, massa.
You be the boss man now,
and all us chilluns must learn to obey.
Major Forbes, stand at attention!
Sergeant Mulcany.
You may commence.
Proceed.
Attention.
Mr. Rawlins.
This morning I...
It would be a great help
if I could talk to you...
about the men from time to time.
That's all.
Shoes, sir.
The men need shoes.
I know. I've been after
the quartermaster for some time.
Now, sir. Now.
The boy was off trying to find hisself
some shoes, Colonel.
He wants to fight...
same as the rest of us.
More, even.
All of the men, like this?
Yes, sir. Most of them.
Good atternoon, Colonel.
Change your mind about that bottle?
I want 600 pair of shoes
and 1,200 pair of socks...
and anything else
you've been holding out on us.
- You piece of rat filth.
- I'd love to help you.
- But we just don't have any.
- Not for niggers, you don't.
- Not for anybody.
- I see. Pity.
I'll just look and see
that you haven't misplaced them.
Son of a bitch!
- Damn it! You can't...
- Can't I?
I'm a colonel, nasty little cuss.
You really think you can keep
without proper shoes
because you think it's funny?
Where would that power come from?
All right. Calm down.
Look, have a drink.
Hey, you barefoot men!
Get over here!
Shoes!
Have a pair.
Here's a pair there.
One pair of shoes here.
Here's another pair.
One pair per customer.
Steward, is there anything you need?
- No, sir.
- Keep me informed.
Yes, sir. I will.
Shoulder arms!
Sir.
From the War Department.
Can anything be done?
- They've got families.
- I know.
We'll protest this
through channels later on.
- Attention, battalion.
- Yes, sir.
Attention, battalion!
You men enlisted in this regiment...
on the understanding...
that you would be paid
the regular army wage...
of $13 a month.
This morning I have been notified...
that since you are a colored regiment,
you will be paid $10 a month.
That ain't fair.
They said 13.
Regiment, fall out
by company to receive pay.
- Where you going, boy?
- To get paid.
Ten dollar a lof of money.
Hey, pop, you titting to lay down
for this too?
Fall in!
Hey. Come on.
Where's your pride, now?
Make your mark right here.
I can write my name.
- Then do it.
- They gonna give us but ten?
You gonna go for that?
A colored soldier stop a bullet
just as good as a white one!
And for less money too!
Yeah! Uncle Abe got hisself
a real bargain here!
- What you say, boy?
- That's right, slaves!
Make your mark.
Get your slave wages!
All you good colored boys,
sign up.
That's right. Tear it up!
Tear it up!
If you men will take no pay...
then none of us will.
Let's hear it for the colonel!
Attention, battalion!
Eyes right!
Eyes front!
Eyes...
right.
Man, I forgot how hot
it was down here.
Welcome home, boy.
Don't worry about it, buck.
Take a good look.
It's all a memory
now that the North man come.
Now that we come.
Colonel Shaw?
Edward Pierce, special assignment
from Harper's Weekly.
- Harper's Weekly?
- Serving an entire nation.
A million loyal readers want to know
what happens when the 54th sees action.
A million and one.
Well, you'll want to see this.
Attention, company!
- Rawlins, front and center.
- Sir!
Mr. Rawlins, this regiment
was formed with the promise...
that only white ofticers
would be commissioned to lead it.
Nothing was mentioned, however,
about noncommissioned ofticers.
Therefore, in recognition ot initiative
taken not only for yourself...
but on behalf
of the entire regiment...
you are hereby awarded the rank
of sergeant major.
Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
- Hip, hip, hooray!
Congratulations.
I ain't sure
I'm wanting this, Colonel.
I know exactly how you feel.
Mama, they're coming home!
They're coming home!
That's right. Ain't no dream.
We run away slaves,
but we come back fightin' men.
Go tell your folks how kingdom come
in the year of jubilee!
Left! Up tight up there!
- Who are these ragamuffin?
- Contrabands right out of the fields.
- Hey. Hey, old man, where from?
- Massachusetts.
Oona march better than we.
Oona march like the buckra soldier.
- I beg your pardon?
- He says we march like white soldiers.
Even talk like the buckra soldier.
- Where you from?
- Oh, round about here.
We were slaves in the field when
the Yankee man come. Say we soldiers.
How you like the army, contraband?
We love it.
We thank the Lord every day...
for the good vittles
and these beautiful clothes.
Tell true, old man.
This year, every day like Christmas.
- Like what?
- Like Christmas.
My country, 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Land where my father died
Land of the pilgrims' pride
From every mountainside
Let freedom ring
Splendid.
They've been working for weeks
in anticipation of your arrival.
We're all very excited
to have you here, Shaw.
- Thank you, sir.
- Lincoln's idea.
Hired a group of New Englanders to teach
our colored how to read and write.
Just your sort of people,
I should think.
Your regiment should enjoy
their stay here.
Yes, I'm sure we'll have a fine time,
but that's not why we're here.
Yes, well, can't promise you
much action.
Just having the coloreds around seems to
have scared the bejesus out of the Rebs.
- Colonel Shaw?
- Excuse me.
I'd like you to meet
some of our instructors.
Dr. Thorpe of Salem.
- It's my pleasure, Colonel Shaw.
- A pleasure.
Dr. Rogers of Philadelphia.
- I know and admire your parents.
- You do, sir? Why, thank you, sir.
Shaw, meet Colonel Montgomery.
He's your brigade commander.
- Colonel.
- Honored, sir.
Colonel Montgomery's
a real jayhawker from Kansas.
Contraband regiment
is his brainchild.
You didn't think yours were the only
coloreds around, did you, Colonel?
I did actually.
Well, I'm sure they'll do just fine.
Have they seen any mischief?
No, sir.
I'm hiking a company over
to the Georgia coast in the morning.
We'll be foraging for supplies.
I could use a hand.
That is, it you think
your men are up to it.
- They are indeed, sir.
- Good. Very good.
- A pleasure.
- Good night.
Beg to report, Colonel, sir.
The troop is fed
and bedded down for the night, sir.
Very good, Corporal.
Pass the word along to "A" Company.
We'll be going into action
in the morning.
Very good, sir.
Your men march handsomely, Colonel.
My compliments.
Thank you, sir.
I am surprised at how well
you handle them.
See, I am from Kentucky originally.
We owned a few ourselves,
so it comes naturally to me.
- You are from Boston, are you not?
- Yes.
It is impossible
to imagine Boston with slaves.
Company, halt!
- Halt!
- Shoulder arms!
Town's clean, sir.
Ain't no Rebs here, just some women.
Well, all right!
You hear that, boys?
Let's clear her out!
What are you doing?
Liberating this town
in the name of the Republic.
The musket, Massa Colonel?
Never shoot it. Shoot now?
Yeah, I don't see why not.
Go ahead.
Shoot the lady, boys!
Don't shoot!
We ain't Secess' here!
That man is a civilian.
That man is Secess',
and Secess' is all the same, son.
Look around. You really think anybody's
gonna put these boys into real combat?
Do you?
They're little children, for God's sake.
They're little monkey children.
You just gotta know
how to control them.
Please, let go! Oh, God!
You see what I mean?
Children!
- Animal! Leave her alone!
- Hey, boy!
Take your hands oft the white lady!
That would not have been necessary
it that Secess' woman hadn't started it.
They'll never learn.
Secess' has got to be
swept away by the hand ot God...
like the Jews of old.
And now I'll have to burn this town.
Nigger soldiers! Nigger soldiers!
Tell your men to set torches
and prepare to fire the buildings.
I will not.
That is an order.
You will do it or face charges
for disobeying your superior officer.
It is an immoral order, and by articles
ot war I am not bound to obey it.
Well, you can just explain that
at your court-marital...
after your men
are placed under my command.
First squad, second platoon.
Fall out to set torches.
Prepare to fire the town.
First squad, second platoon!
Fall out!
Right face!
Forward march!
The colors, Sergeant Major.
Change the colors.
What you lookin' at,
biscuit eaters?
You think you better than me?
You think you my judge?
You ain't nothin'!
Despite my many requests,
it has become clear...
that we are to be
used only for manual labor.
The men 's good humor
darkened by idleness and despair.
Why keep drilling if they're never given
the opportunity to prove themselves?"
Attention!
as well as to
the General Staff in Washington.
But I feel that only a letter
directly from you to Lincoln himself...
I am sure you both pray,
as I do...
that all this
has not been in vain."
Look like we're goin' the wrong way.
Hey. Hey, come on now.
Buck up, boys!
Hey, buck up now! Come on!
Someday they're gonna
let the 54th get into it, see?
And all your troubles
would be over, huh?
Come on now. Cheer up! Hey!
- What'd you say, boy?
- "Boy"?
- Let me tell you...
- Shut up, Trip...
Would you get up off me, snowflake?
See, let me explain
something to you.
The way I figure, I figure this war
would be over a whole lot sooner...
it you boys just turn right on around
and head on back down that way...
and you let us head on up there
where the real fightin' is.
Them men dyin' up that road.
It wouldn't be nothin' but Rebs dying,
it they let the 54th in it.
- Listen...
- Hold it!
As you were, Trip! As you were!
You men move on.
Stripes on a nigger.
That's like tits on a bull.
You're lookin' at a higher rank,
Corporal. You'll obey and like it.
- Make me.
- I'll make you.
- What the hell is goin' on here?
- Attention!
You! Yes, you. What's your name?
I'm putting you up on charges.
- Ain't no cause for that, sir.
- What's that, Sergeant?
It's just a soldiers' fight, sir.
- All right. You men move along.
- Front step! Forward! March!
Move it!
You men get back to work.
Back to work! Let's go!
- We'll see you again.
- Go dig a latrine.
Go strum a banjo, boy.
Come on.
I've got the guard.
Let me use your looking glass.
Thank you.
Yeah, button up that collar.
Suck in that gut.
Tuck in them big black lips.
Lighten your skin.
Shrink up that nose.
I don't have to listen to this.
Where you goin', boy?
- Let me by.
- Let you by?
Let you by?
Let me tell you something, boy.
You can march like the white man.
You can talk like 'em.
You can learn his songs.
You can even wear his suits.
But you ain't never
gonna be nothin' to him...
but an ugly-ass chimp
in a blue suit.
- Oh, you don't like that, do you?
- No.
What we gonna do about it?
Want to fight me, boy?
Huh? What you gonna
do about it?
You want to fight me, don't you?
Don't you?
- Come on, nig.
- All right! All right!
Get your hands off me,
gravedigger.
Goddamn it. Does the whole world
gotta stomp in your face?
- Nigger, get your hands off me.
- Ain't no niggers here.
So the white man give you
a couple of stripes...
next thing you know, you hollerin'
and orderin' everybody around...
like you the massa himself.
Nigger, you ain't nothin'
but the white man's dog.
And what are you?
So full of hate
you wanna fight everybody...
'cause you've been whipped
and chased by hounds.
That might not be livin',
but it sure ain't dyin'.
And dying's what these white boys
been doin' for goin' on three years now.
Dyin' by the thousands.
Dyin' for you, fool!
I know, 'cause I dug the graves.
And all the time I'm diggin',
I'm asking myself, "When?
When, O Lord,
is it gonna be our time?"
Time's comin' when
we're gonna have to ante up.
Ante up and kick in like men.
Like men!
You watch who you call a nigger.
It there's any niggers around here,
it's you.
Smart-mouth, stupid-ass,
swamp-running nigger.
It you ain't careful,
that's all you ever gonna be.
You men go on back to business.
Ah, Shaw.
Sit down.
Well, Colonel,
what can I do for you?
You can give me and my regiment
a transter to combat command.
Couldn't do it, Colonel.
You're much too valuable
to my operations here.
May I sit?
Thank you. Major.
I've written a letter
to my father...
asking him to press Governor Andrew
and President Lincoln.
But I don't have to wait
for all that, do I?
Colonel Montgomery, would you
bring that ashtray over here?
But valuable to your operations here,
do you say?
Your foraging,
your depredations?
Yes, I've become quite a student
of your operations in this region.
Thirty-four mansions,
I think it was, pillaged and burned...
under Colonel Montgomery's expedition
of the Combahee.
Four thousand bales of cotton
smuggled through the lines...
with payment to parties unknown...
except by you.
False quartermaster requisitions.
Major Forbes here has seen the copies.
Yes, indeed.
Along with confiscated valuables
shipped north as personal baggage.
Shall I go on?
Can you?
I can report you
to the War Department.
Oh, yes. I can do that.
Let you take your regiment
out to fight?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Show what they can do.
- When?
- You are bright-eyed, aren't you?
When?
Just as soon as
I can write the orders.
Major.
Double-quick!
All right, company, in a line.
Double-quick!
All right, men, form a firing line.
Over here.
Form a firing line right here!
Front rank, kneel!
Steady, boys!
Firing by battalion!
Aim!
Charge!
Fire!
Cease fire! Recover!
Here they come!
- Reload!
- Reload! Load!
- Load it! Load it!
- Quickly, men!
- Ready!
- Ready!
- Aim!
- Aim!
Get ready. Get ready!
Fire!
- Reload!
- Reload!
Quickly!
- Fire at will!
- Fire at will!
Pour it in!
Charge!
Look out, boy! Look out!
Fire!
They're turnin' tail!
Run, you Rebs!
Deploy skirmishers, Captain.
Re-form your ranks!
Re-form your ranks!
Fall in! On the double!
- Form Company.
- Thomas!
How do, Colonel?
Hurts, doesn't it?
Well, I'm extremely jealous.
You'll be back in Boston before me,
sitting by the fire...
reading Hawthorne,
cup of decent coffee.
I'm not going back.
Thomas, listen to me.
You're shot. You have to go back.
Robert, promise me...
that you won't send me back.
Promise me!
All right. All right.
Colonel Shaw!
- What is all this?
- You haven't heard?
Lee was turned back in Pennsylvania
at Gettysburg...
now Grant's taken Vicksburg,
and all on the Fourth of July.
- My God!
- Yeah!
It looks like it'll all be over
by Christmas.
- So, how did they do?
- Splendid. Just splendid.
- Any casualties?
- Forty-two.
Give me the details.
I'll wire it in.
I don't think we got
a prayer of making the paper.
I'll talk to you later
in your tent.
As you were.
- Trip, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
You fought very well
yesterday, Trip.
Sergeant Rawlins has recommended
that you receive a commendation.
Yes, sir?
Yes, and I think you should bear
the regimental colors.
Well...
It's considered quite an honor.
Why not?
Well, I'm...
wantin' to say somethin', sir,
but I...
Go ahead.
All right. See...
I ain't fightin' this war
for you, sir.
I see.
I mean, what's the point?
Ain't nobody gonna win.
It's just gonna go on and on.
- It can't go on forever.
- But ain't nobody gonna win.
Somebody's gonna win.
Who?
I mean, you get to go on back
to Boston to a big house and all that.
What about us?
What do we get?
Well, you won't get anything
if we lose.
What do you want to do?
I don't know, sir.
It stinks, I suppose.
Yeah, it stinks bad.
And we all covered up in it.
Ain't nobody clean.
Be nice to get clean though.
How do we do that?
We ante up and kick in, sir.
But I still don't
wanna carry your flag.
No one will ever take Charleston
without first...
silencing the forts
which protect its harbor.
And the first one that must
be taken is that, Fort Wagner.
Wagner mounts a ten-inch Columbiad...
three smoothbore 32-pounders...
a 42-pound Carronade...
a 10-inch Coast Mortar
and four 12-pound Howitzers...
plus a garrison
of about a thousand men.
As many of you gentlemen
may be aware...
for the last four days
our navy has weakened Wagner...
with a constant barrage.
Headquarters has determined a time
for our attack.
We will proceed with a direct
frontal assault tomorrow at dusk.
The problem, gentlemen,
is the approach.
The ocean and the marsh
leave only a narrow strip of sand...
a natural defile, through which we can
only send one regiment at a time.
Our best hope is that that leading
regiment can keep the Rebs occupied...
long enough for reinforcements
to exploit the breach.
Needless to say, casualties
in the leading regiment may be extreme.
General Strong.
The 54th Massachusetts...
requests the honor of leading
the attack on Fort Wagner.
It's Colonel Shaw, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
You and your men
haven't slept for two days.
That's right, sir.
And you think they have the strength
to lead this charge?
There's more to fighting
than rest, sir.
There's character.
There's strength of heart.
You should have seen us
in action two days ago.
We were a sight to see.
We'll be ready, sir.
When do you want us?
O Lord, O Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
He packed in the animals
two by two
An ox, a camel and a kangaroo
Packed them in that ark so tight
I couldn't get no sleep that night
Grown-up sons
Shem and Ham
Tell me about God's master plan
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
- Tomorrow we goin' to battle.
- All right.
So, Lordy, let me fight
with the rifle in one hand...
and the Good Book in the other.
- Yeah!
- Amen!
That if I should die
at the muzzle of the rifle...
die on water or on land...
I may know that You,
blessed Jesus Almighty, are with me.
With Jesus!
And I have no fear. Amen.
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, we stand before You
this evenin'...
to say thank you.
We thank You, Father,
for Your grace...
and Your many blessings.
Now, I run off...
and left all my young'uns
and my kinfolk in bondage.
So I'm standing here this evening,
Heavenly Father...
to ask Your blessings
on all of us...
so that if tomorrow
is our great getting-up mornin'...
if tomorrow we have to meet
the Judgment Day...
O Heavenly Father,
we want You to let our folks know...
that we died facin' the enemy.
We want 'em to know
that we went down standin' up...
Yes, Lord!
Among those that are fightin'
against our oppression!
We want 'em to know, Heavenly Father,
that we died for freedom.
We ask these blessings
in Jesus' name. Amen!
- Trip! Come on!
- No, I ain't...
You better get
your butt up there, boy.
Just say what you think.
Just say what you feel. Go on now.
- Come on.
- Preach it, brother.
Go on. Let it out.
I ain't much
about no prayin' now.
I ain't never had no family and...
killed off my mama.
This feels funny.
- Come on.
- It's all right.
Come on now.
You're doin' fine.
Well, I just...
You know, y'all's... y'all's...
Y'all's the onliest family I got.
Well, that's all right.
And, uh...
- I love the 54th.
- All right.
Ain't much matter what happens tomorrow,
'cause we men, ain't we?
- Yes, sir!
- Amen!
- We men, ain't we?
- Yes, sir!
Shit.
All right.
- Attention, company!
- Attention, company!
Battalion, halt!
We ready, Colonel.
Left! Left! Left, right!
- Give 'em hell, 54th!
- Give 'em hell, 54th!
- Ready! Fire!
- Ready! Fire!
- Ought to be quite a show, Pierce.
- Best seat in the house.
I wonder if you might
do something for me.
I have some letters here.
Personal things.
Certainly, Colonel.
Also, if I should fall...
remember what you see here.
- Ready!
- Fire!
- Reload!
- Fire!
You men are relieved!
Report to the rear as stretcher bearers.
- Do it now!
- About-face!
Forward! March!
You go on, honey.
We be by directly.
Colonel Shaw!
It this man should fall...
who will lift the flag
and carry on?
I will.
Huzzah!
I'll see you in the fort, Thomas.
- Fix!
- Fix!
Bayonets!
- Shoulder!
- Shoulder!
Arms!
- Charge!
- Charge!
Bayonets!
At the quickstep!
Forward!
March!
Double-quick time!
March!
Steady, boys!
Charge!
Charge!
Come on!
Forward! Forward!
Keep your ranks!
Take cover in the dunes!
Take cover!
Company commanders, we'll wait here
and advance under cover of darkness.
Get down over there!
Get down!
Company commanders!
Order your men to wait here!
Get down!
- Sergeant Rawlins!
- Sir!
Pass the word along!
Forward on my command!
Forward on my command!
- Ready on the colors, men!
- Forward on my command! Ready!
- Charge!

Forward, men! Forward!
