Ow. Ow!
I don't believe this.
Here I am, on the verge
of one of my biggest deals--
the Augean Stables
manure concession--
I get attacked
by crazed flying insects.
Salmoneus, it's just a bee
sting. It won't kill you.
How do you know?
What if I'm allergic?
I could swell up and die.
I have to admit,
that does look pretty swollen.
I happen to be big-boned.
Look, maybe Palamedes
can help us.
I hear his daughter
studies medicine.
Now you're talking!
I could use
some professional help.
No argument there.
Ow! It's starting to throb.
Well, I'm not gonna
touch it for ya.
Get that tapestry down!
You!
Got it.
The king's command. Come on.
Let's pick up the pace.
And clear away those candles.
Bring that down.
Be quick about it.
Straighten it out.
This is crazy.
Rededicating Aphrodite's
temple to Hera?
What King Augeus wants,
King Augeus gets.
We'll see about that.
You know, someone
ought to put that nutcase
out of his misery.
You keep talking about
our king like that, and
both of us will hang.
I'm not afraid of that wacko...
or General Machus.
You two!
Back to work!
Less cackle, more Spackle!
Why isn't that
statue of Aphrodite
knocked down yet?
To be honest, General,
we're scared.
If Aphrodite finds out
we destroyed her statue,
our love life could suffer.
Better believe it,
hammerhead.
You won't have a life
if that statue's still standing
when the king gets back.
General Machus, we know King
Augeus hasn't been well,
but... he has to realize--
Watch your mouth!
Now, back to work!
When I return, I want
to see her on her back.
Hey, you watchyourmouth!
Citizens of Elis, it would
be unwise to forget...
that, by the king's command,
this temple
now belongs to Hera.
Don't bet on it.
My people,
I have good news.
No longer are you
to be enslaved by the land.
I decree that from
this moment forth...
you'll be free to live life
as you choose,
be masters of
your own fate,
answering to no one.
Now go.
Start your new life.
Go.
- Go, go, go, go!
-
-I said, go!
-
-
- Go, go, go, go.
Here we are, my beauties.
Sorry dinner is so late,
but grain is getting scarce.
Ah!
The livestock's gone!
- Is there a problem, Palamedes?
- What's happened
to the livestock?
Ah!
I've decreed that all dumb
animals should be set free.
Could you tell me
where they're exercising
their newfound freedom?
Who knows?
It's their choice.
I have looked out for you
since we were kids, Augeus.
We have talked about this.
You're not supposed to meddle.
I can do whatever I like,
stable master!
- And I'm not Augeus!
-
I am Zeus, King of the Gods!
Hah! Hah!
This is the story
of a time long ago,
a time of myth and legend,
when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,
and they plagued mankind
with suffering.
Only one man dared
to challenge their power--
Hercules.
Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,
a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.
He journeyed the earth,
battling the minions
of his wicked stepmother, Hera,
the all-powerful
queen of the gods.
But wherever
there was evil,
wherever an innocent
would suffer,
there would be... Hercules.
-
-
Hail!
I can't tell you
how much it would mean to me
to get your endorsement...
on this Augean Stables manure.
I agreed to introduce you
to the stable master,
that's all.
We're talking about
one of your 12 great labors!
This will immortalize you.
Think of it-- your likeness
on every sack of freshly--
That's not exactly the way
I want to be remembered.
Okay, we lose the likeness.
How about your signature
in the corner?
A meeting with Palamedes,
that's it.
Aw! Ow.
I wonder what's
going on over there.
Andrea, come with me quickly.
Ow.
Ready? Pull.
Oh, man!
- Uh-oh.
- I told you we should've
just knocked it over.
-Now what do we do?
-What does it matter? We're just
going to melt it down anyway.
I'll melt you down.
- Whoa! Wait.
- Herc, what are you doing here?
I could ask you
the same thing.
I'm looking for King Augeus.
That creep had the nerve
to rededicate my temple to Hera.
- I oughta fry him like a fish.
- Um, Hercules,
who're you talking to?
That's, uh, Aphrodite.
Aphrodite--
What's she wearing?
-  Should I
give him a cheap thrill?
- No--
- Hello again, stud muffin.
- Hello again, Voluptuous Ones.
Um, last time we met,
you promised you'd
rock my world.
Oh, you're gonna have
to rock it yourself, baby cakes.
I'm on a mission.
It boggles the mind--
Augeus dumping me for cow-face.
That's the problem.
See, his mind is already
a little... boggled.
- I don't think he's
doing this out of spite.
- Then you better talk to him.
If he doesn't stop,
I'll show him what
spite is all about.
Later.
Oh, yeah.
I'm her stuff mutton.
She wants me like
Charon wants coins.
Help me. I--
Yes, sir.
Wait a second.
That copper--
Melting the--
Candlesticks
are in a separate box.
Hercules, how do you feel
about commemorative coins?
Salmoneus,
let's find Palamedes.
A special offer!
With every sack of manure,
a free Hercules coin!
Maybe not free.
Oh, suitable for framing!
Amaze your friends!
Confuse your enemies!
He's not in the house.
Palamedes!
Palamedes.
What happened?
Uh, Hercules--
Wait, wait, wait!
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Hercules.
Welcome back.
I-- Who's your friend?
Salmoneus is the name.
Manure is the game.
I want to talk to you
about the possibility--
Now isn't the time.
Time is dinars, Hercules.
From the look of things,
he might not have much ti--
I'm sorry.
Palamedes,
who did this to you?
King Augeus.
Huh?
He thinks he's Zeus.
I caught one of
his "lightning bolts."
Come again?
He's painted these rocks
silver and-- Ah!
I get the picture.
That explains the temple.
He must think Hera is his wife.
But why are the stables empty?
Poor fool wanted
to free the livestock.
We depend on
those animals for food.
I have to...
get after them--
No, no, no. You rest.
I'll... take care of it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You mean, every cow,
bull, heifer, gone?
Don't worry.
I'll bring them back.
I hope so!
No cow, no cow flop!
I'll be ruined!
The--
Oh. Oh.
It's kind of... late
for a lunch break,
isn't it, General?
When the people
learned of your decision
to free the livestock,
they left the temple
in protest.
And you just
let them go?
I couldn't kill them all.
Why not?
Defying the will of Zeus
is punishable by death.
You-- Your Highness, I appeal
to you. Let the people
return to the fields.
The harvest is nearly lost.
And now, without the herds,
we may all starve!
What is this
"Highness" stuff?
Oh. Oh, you doubt
that I am Zeus?
No, Sire--
uh, m-mighty Zeus.
All I want is what is best
for the kingdom.
I decide what's best.
Now, assemble the troops.
We ride into the city
after I speak with my queen.
We have to travel
to the next village.
Ooh.
Bee sting still
bothering you?
A little.
I don't have time
to think about that.
I gotta get to that temple,
make a deal for the statue and
find a forge to melt it down.
Ah, ah, ah! I would think
twice before messing around with
anything of Aphrodite's. Okay?
Besides, I need you to keep
an eye on Palamedes while
I go look for the king.
Whoa! What happens if that wacko
shows up here, huh?
Ow! Ow! What--
Sorry.
Hercules.
Uh, Melanippe.
Wow, you, uh, look, uh--
I-It's been a while.
Uh--
Father?
What happened?
Oh, he had a run-in
with the king.
I was afraid something
like this would happen.
He'll be all right.
He's just resting.
Oh. Uh, by the way,
this is Salmoneus.
And he'll be staying here
while I go look for Augeus.
You're studying medicine,
aren't you?
Yes.
Maybe you could take
a look at his bee sting.
See ya.
So, bee sting?
Where is it?
Oh, it's...
nowhere you could--
I-It's not--
Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow!
Oh.
These people don't
understand how hard it is
to run a universe!
I'm surrounded
by incompetents!
Ex-squeeze me?
If you're looking for Hera,
you got the wrong address,
honey.
Who--
Oh. Aphrodite!
- Well, if it isn't
Daddy's little girl!
- As if.
Young lady, if you
expect to get the reins
to the chariot tonight,
you're gonna have to wear
something a little more...
presentable than that.
Very cute, Clueless,
but I'm here to reclaim
my temple.
Oh, I'm sensing
a little hostility
in the atrium.
I'll tell you what.
Daddy's late for
a town meeting.
You behave yourself,
and when I get back, we'll have
a nice, long talk about it.
Okay?
Herc was right.
That guy is definitely
two bunnies shy of a hutch.
Now, hmm.
What this place needs
is just a little bit more... me.
Mmm.
Much better.
No!
Say the word.
The word is "don't."
You all right?
Yeah.
What's going on here?
King Augeus ordered
the old man killed
to punish the people...
for abandoning their work
at the temple.
And you obeyed him?
He's the king.
We follow orders.
Hah! Whoa!
What's the meaning of this?
Why wasn't that man killed?
Great Zeus, perhaps the arrival
of your son, Hercules,
forced a delay.
He really thinks he's Zeus?
Humor him.
My boy!
You're looking... well!
Oh, let's say we toss
the old lightning bolt around...
once I'm done
with this business, huh?
I-I-I-- You know, maybe,
uh, some other time. I--
I-- Actually, I'm surprised
that the King of the Gods...
would stoop
to killing a lowly mortal
just to make a point.
Oh, perhaps
you're right, son.
I haven't been feeling
like myself lately.
Mm-hmm.
Cease all extermination
of the peasantry!
Wise decision, King Augeus.
- What did you call me?
- Uh, I meant Zeus.
Uh-huh. Teach my general
some manners.
Come on, Augeus.
This is ridiculous!
Ah, my son needs a lesson too!
Get them!
Well, what are you waiting for?
Do you wanna loseyourheads?
-
- Wait!
Aah!
All right!
Aah!
Give it to him!
All right!
-
- Let's bring him down!
- Have you forgotten
that I'm your general?
- Oh!
That's the way!
- You want a fight?
I'll give you a fight!
- I got him!
Will you speak with respect
to your elders?
You all right?
Yeah.
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Easy.
Augeus, what's going on?
This isn't like you.
You'll pay for
this... humiliation!
Out of my way!
I'm still King of the Gods.
Well?
Augeus was always a bit off,
but he was harmless,
so people put up
with his eccentricities.
Let's get outta here.
Lately, he's got worse.
Now he's downright dangerous.
I hate ya!
Look at yourself.
Is that any kind of appearance
for the... King of the Gods?
No wonder they don't...
respect you.
Who-- Who are you?
Why, Zeus, don't you
recognize your wife?
Hera?
Is that you, my queen?
Throw it.
Th-Throw it?
Yah!
How does it feel to possess
that kind of power?
Good. Real good.
The powers are
yours to keep,
but on one condition:
You must kill Hercules
by sunset.
So be it.
You did it!
We can't thank you enough
for returning the livestock.
Well, I'm glad
I could help out.
Hercules.
There's mutton
for dinner tonight.
Can we have a word?
Sure.
Um, we... have a request.
Okay.
We... want you
to kill the king.
I can't do that.
I know you have a problem,
but that's no way to solve it.
You saw what he did
to Palamedes and
the old man at the well,
and next time
somebody could die.
Augeus is still a human being
and not totally responsible
for his actions, and--
Look. I'll speak to him
on your behalf.
Maybe I can persuade him
to step down.
I hope so,
because if he refuses,
the people are ready to revolt.
You're looking happier.
I got my temple back
looking the way it should.
It's important to have
one's priorities in order.
Mm-hmm.
- Hercules.
- Hey, Palamedes.
Shouldn't you be resting?
The villagers have asked me
to talk to you.
They have a problem.
Oh, I know, I know.
They want me to kill Augeus.
- Actually, it's Aphrodite
they're angry with.
- They wanna kill me?
Uh, this might not be
the time to--
For generations we've
worshipped her faithfully,
but she's done nothing
to help us with the king.
Maybe we should
discuss this later.
We're all give, give, give,
and Aphrodite's all
take, take, take.
And then when we need her help,
she's never around.
Look, pal,
you people were ready
to throw me over for Hera,
and now you want my help?
Forget it.
I'm outta here.
That was Aphrodite?
Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.
Don't tell me she heard.
Every word. Hmm.
Uh--
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm?
Uh, could you hurry,
please?
I'm getting a nasty draft.
This won't take a minute.
- Very attractive.
- Salmoneus!
I mean the bowl!
It's really nice work.
Oh. It was made for me
by a local craftsman
for my birthday.
Whoa!
For a warmhearted girl,
you got some cold hands there.
Ah, ah, ah.
How does that feel?
Ah.
That's incredible.
The pain is gone.
Thank you.
Oop.
That's cold.
Has your friend ever tried
to engrave something,
say, like a coin?
I don't know.
Why do you ask?
I have an idea that could
make me-- him, you, us,
all of us, a lot of money.
I'm not that
interested in money.
I just want to help people.
You're so sweet,
and you've led
such a sheltered life.
Aphrodite.
My humblest apologies.
Get up.
I'm not gonna waste you.
We have to talk.
Can't you do something
about this smell?
Sorry, but, uh,
itisa stable.
Whatever.
Anyway, those things you
said about me to Hercules,
was that some sort
of a bad joke?
I can't lie to you, Aphrodite.
It was the truth.
What are you people,
weirdos?
How can you hate
the Goddess of Love?
No one hates you, Aphrodite.
The people just feel
you've neglected them,
and, to tell the truth,
you have.
Let's see you try
to keep the whole world
in bed and out of trouble.
You're right.
We probably expect
too much from you,
but maybe if you worried less
about your temples and more
about the people who worship--
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've offended you again.
Yeah, but... it takes
a lot of guts to tell
a goddess when she's wrong.
I respect that.
Now, this smell--
I'm starting to gag.
Pardon me.
Have you seen the king?
Uh-uh.
Thanks.
Hercules, any luck
finding Augeus?
No. No one has seen him
since he wandered off
yesterday.
Well, if I know the king,
he'll turn up.
Let's check the village
one more time.
You know, when we were
younger, he looked up to me
like an older brother.
Seemed like I was the only one
who could reason with him.
Now I don't think anyone can--
not me, not even you.
Well, someone needs
to talk to him.
Yeah.
Actually, I... just had
a nice little talk myself...
with... your sister.
A very lovely woman,
I might add.
Most men would agree.
I was referring
to the beauty in here.
Really? Well, then you're
one of the few who's bothered
to get past her good looks.
General!
Still no sign
of the king, General.
Keep looking.
Recruit the townspeople,
if necessary, but find him!
Right away. Come on.
I never should've
let him go.
Miss me?
Sire, you're all right.
Yeah, fat lot you care.
Standing by while
my own son disgraced me!
You'll pay for that.
Y-Your High-- Zeus,
what Hercules did to you
was an accident.
What I do to him won't be.
Watch. Yah!
Ah!
Ah! It's good to be...
King of the Gods.
It helps people to have
beautiful things.
He might not be interested.
He's a craftsman, an artist.
And I respect that.
With the money he's gonna make,
he can open up his own gallery.
What we do, see, is melt down
Aphrodite's statue--
Whoa-oh!
Whoa! It's okay with her.
It was broken anyway.
Mint the coins, have your friend
draw Hercules's image on them.
Hey, could he do a charcoal
rendering on a burlap sack?
I'm not sure.
How about forging
his signature?
Forgery?
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong word.
I meant an interpretation
of his signature.
-
-
Sorry!
- You guys all right in there?
- We're fine!
We're just discussing
the economics and aesthetic
value of commemorative coins.
-
-
Yeah, right.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
No dessert till you finish
your vegetables, young man.
Augeus, wait.
I'd hoped we could be
one big, happy family.
But for me to stay
King of the Gods,
Hera needs you dead
by sundown.
Hera, huh?
Figures.
That explains the backhand.
Hercules?
Hercules, what's wrong?
Palamedes, get out of here!
What's happened?
Where's Melanippe?
Smokin'!
Hold on, Hercules!
We're coming! Hold on!
- Palamedes?
-
Palamedes.
Father!
I'm sorry. He's dead.
Hercules?
I don't get it.
How could Augeus throw
real lightning bolts?
Hera gave him
the powers of a god.
She wants him to kill me
by sundown.
Aphrodite?
Wait.
You can see her?
Yeah.
This time Hera's gone
too far, giving that
crazy king those powers.
Please. Please.
My father didn't
deserve this fate.
You're a goddess.
Isn't there something
you can do to help him?
I'm sorry.
If you want to marry a prince,
that I can do,
but this is totally
out of my league.
How can you just let him
die like this, after all
we've done to honor you?
Please.
Please, can't you
bring him back?
Okay.
Hades owes me one.
I can call in a marker.
But this is a one-time deal.
You understand?
This aura will keep his spirit
from going to the other side,
but it's only good
until nightfall.
- But there's--
- I'm sorry.
It's the best I can do.
Don't worry.
Hercules will find a way
to bring him back.
Won't you?
Yeah.
Aphrodite.
Uh, are you crying?
Can't a goddess have
a little privacy?
I didn't realize Palamedes
meant that much to you.
He respected me...
for what he saw
below the surface.
Well, he's a special man.
I've just never seen
you like this, at least
not over a mortal.
Do you think
I don't have feelings?
Maybe you don't know me
as well as you thought you did.
Maybe not.
I'll leave you alone.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna see if I can find
a way to revive Palamedes...
and stop Augeus before he
destroys the whole kingdom.
Maybe I can help.
I could keep the king busy
while you work on Palamedes.
That's a good idea.
Just remember, that aura
only works until sundown.
What is it with
gods and sundown?
This time,
right down the middle!
-Sire!
- Oh, for the love
of me, what now?
- The troops are ready to march
on the city, as you commanded.
-
Good. It's time my subjects
gave me the respect I deserve.
I'm afraid they're gonna
have to learn the hard way,
like General Machus here!
Daddy!
Aphrodite.
Shouldn't you be at...
goddess finishing school
or something?
Expelled.
Bad attitude.
Actually, I've been thinking
that, with Hercules gone,
we should really be spending
some more time together.
So... I'm moving in.
Moving in?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Here?
Sire! The troops
are waiting!
Uh, tell 'em to,
uh, stand down.
You're right, kitten.
Family comes first.
Lovely, aren't they?
You're doing excellent work.
Excellent.
Now, as soon as you emboss
the rest of these, the market
for commemorative coins...
will be... open.
Speaking of which,
when am I gonna be paid?
Keep your tunic on.
I'm good for it.
I'm short of cash right now.
How do you feel about
taking manure in trade?
You gotta be kidding, right?
Kidding? This is
no ordinary manure!
I'm talking about the stuff
Hercules cleaned out of
the Augean Stables in his youth.
So you wanna pay me
with cow dung?
I'm not talking about cow dung.
This... is a piece
of history.
This is the stuff
of legends... and gods.
Holy--
Exactly. You can't put a price
on something like this.
And for your efforts,
I'm willing to part with,
shall we say, four bags.
You're lowballing me.
Five bags.
My final offer.
Salmoneus, have you seen
that copper arm from
Aphrodite's statue?
It's over there.
We melted it down.
That's all right. Thanks.
Where are you going
with that?
Don't worry.
It's for a good cause.
I paid good money for that!
And then she told me that she
said that I never said that,
which is totally
not true.
So I told Athena to tell Artemis
that if she didn't return
the sandals she borrowed,
I was going-- Oh!
Augeus!
Hera?
Is there a problem,
my queen?
Hercules is still alive,
you idiot!
Alive? Oh, no, no, no,
that's impossible.
He plots your destruction
while we speak.
Why do you think
she's here?
Why... are you here?
Aw, Daddy,
uh, you have been enjoying our
little father-daughter chats,
haven't you?
She's playing you for a fool!
That's not true... entirely.
I'm afraid, kitten,
you give me no choice.
You always take her side!
This time, your son
will come to you,
and I expect you
to finish the job!
Consider it done,
my queen.
Ooh.
You sure this
is gonna work?
Nope, but it's worth a shot.
I've seen lightning do
a lot of strange things,
and I'm hoping a strong enough
blast might revive Palamedes.
Uh-huh. And you really think
you can control lightning
with a piece of copper?
Old buddy, you've taken
too many blows to the head.
And where do these
lightning bolts come from?
You're gonna let Augeus stand
there and throw them at you?
Yeah.
Excuse us. We need
to get inside the temple.
- The temple is closed.
- Please. This is important.
I'm sure it is,
but the only way you're
getting inside that temple...
is over our dead bodies.
Uh, you might want
to rephrase that.
They could
use more training. Hmm.
Busted to prison guard.
That's a long drop
from general.
Aphrodite, please.
I don't want any more trouble.
Oh? Well, then you
shouldn't be wearing this.
Pucker up.
- Sorry about that.
Are you okay?
- Never better.
I don't mean to be a pest,
but the last time I checked,
it was getting dark.
We have to move him
to the center of the atrium.
What do you mean, we?
Uh, help.
Mm.
It won't... budge.
How many times
have I told those kids...
not to play in the temple?
Hercules, the sun's
almost down.
- Please hurry.
- Yeah. Yeah. Careful!
The statue!
That was close.
-
Whoo! So was that!
- Yeah.
Daddy's home!
You guys keep
your heads down!
No problem.
Okay, Augeus, hit me
with your best shot.
Augeus. Oh, that's it,
young man.
You are grounded.
That tears it.
We're talking big-time
retribution now.
When you see Hades,
tell him Zeus
sends his best!
Aah!
Now who's grounded?
Father!
He's alive! Alive!
Augeus.
Smoke. That stuff'll kill ya.
Hercules, what are
you doing here?
I feel like I've been
run over by a chariot.
Actually, it was more
like lightning, but don't worry.
I know a good healer.
Come on.
Whoa!
Oh.
Palamedes. You're back.
Thanks to you.
We can take care of him now.
Are you sure
he's up to this?
I'm fine.
And I'll help out.
Father and Augeus have
been friends for so long,
it's almost like they're family.
Palamedes. Oh, thank
the gods it's you.
Come on, Augeus,
old friend.
Actually,
the name's Ulysses.
Perhaps you've
heard of me, huh?
I've been thinking about
having a little cruise
around the Mediterranean.
Now, what's the deal?
this work of art.
Not in this lifetime.
It's an original.
The nerve of some people.
What now?
These guys
from Milo, trying to sell me
that statue of Aphrodite.
They think I was born yesterday?
What good is a statue
without arms?
Aphrodite de Milo, ha!
He's right.
They should fix it.
I don't know.
I kind of like it.
By the way, I never
got to thank you.
For what?
For putting that aura
around Palamedes,
giving us a chance
to revive him.
You're the one
who did all the work.
I never would have come up
with that lightning idea.
Well, you helped out a...
little bit there too.
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
Mm-hmm.
We work pretty well
together, big brother.
That we do.
And I got to see a side of you
I've never seen before.
Really?
Which side is that?
Yourinside,
and I liked what I saw.
I'd say you're
quite a piece of art,
with or without arms.
Really?
Really.
You're so cool sometimes!
