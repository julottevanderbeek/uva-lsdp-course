Detail, halt.
Color detail, left face.
Arms at attention!

Ready. Two.

Attention on deck.
Request permission
to come aboard.
Permission granted, sir.
My name is Victor Henry.
You look great.
You smell great.
You haven't even looked at me.
You're smelling fried chicken.
It's been five days.
Dad's here.
Ahh. That's nice.
He's in the backyard with Vic.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Dad!
Dad! Look who's here.
Hey, Warren.
Hey, dad.
I almost visited you
on the Enterprise today.
I'm, uh...
relieving the North Hampton.
The North Hampton?
Why, that's great news.
I can't believe it.
My old man-
skipper of our screen flagship.
Congratulations, dad.
Thank you.
I stopped by
the California shore office.
These just came in.
Okay. Lunch in half an hour, men.
Come on, sprout.
Let's clean you up for lunch.
I'll ride down the hill with you later.
From the Chief Bureau
of Navigation, Captain Victor Henry,
detached commanding officer
of the U.S.S. California BB44,
to relieve commanding officer
of the U.S.S. North Hampton CA26.
I relieve you, sir.
I stand relieved, sir.
Congratulations.
Commander Grigg,
all ship's standing
orders remain in force.
Dismiss the crew from quarters.
Aye, aye, sir.
Crew dismissed.
Hey, Gene.
My father's ship-
new command.
Right 5 degrees rudder.
All ahead 2/3.
Right, 5 degrees rudder,
aye sir.
All ahead 2/3, aye sir.
Sir, rudder's right, 5 degrees.
Engine's ahead 2/3, sir.
Gentlemen, I want to bomb Japan.
I want to strike them at once.
Anyway, as soon as possible.
I want to be able to tell
Churchill when he arrives
that such an air strike
is in the works.
Mr. Secretary of War.
Mr. President, such a token raid
at this stage will be very difficult.
And very costly, sir.
Not a token raid.
I said strike.
I want to hook the Japs,
shake them up,
give them something to think about
besides running wild
with victories in the South Pacific
and East Asia,
disrupt that timetable of theirs.
Mr. President,
with our present bombers,
our closest air base in the Aleutians
is out of range with Japan.
I've been studying maps.
How about striking them
from North China or Siberia?
If these governments will agree,
sure, Mr. President.
The logistics are formidable, sir.
And will take months?
But then we can hit them hard.
How about a carrier strike?
When ordered, Mr. President.
At once?
Zero possibility of surprise,
Mr. President.
Against overwhelming odds.
The Japs know our
carrier strike range...
Their land-based bomber patrols
cover the sea approaches
far beyond that.
Then that sounds like
a suicide mission.
No. I want a surprise-
a jolt to the Japs
and a psychological lift
to our people and our allies,
but a victory.
Those aviators must have
a good fighting chance.
A way will be sought
and found, Mr. President.
Fast.
Fast.
Splendid, General.
Now, gentlemen,
sit yourselves down.
The word from headquarters
for war patrol number one
is that a mess of big transports
have already left the Jap home
islands for the Philippines
escorted by battleships,
carriers, cruisers,
and God knows what else
for an invasion of Luzon.
They'll probably hit the beaches
of Lingayen and Gulf,
and from there,
try to march to Manila.
It looks like Christmas
on patrol for the Devilfish
and most of the squadron.
Guam and Wake look to be goners,
probably be operational
Jap air bases within a week.
So our line is cut.
We'll be patrolling in waters
totally controlled by the enemy.
Our mission is to harass
and, if we can,
prevent the landing of the main
Japanese expeditionary force.
It goes without saying
enemy destroyers
will be as thick as fleas
on a dog's back.
Questions?
Yes, sir.
Are we authorized to sink
unarmed merchantmen and tankers?
Okay. Here are our
orders on that point.
On December 8th, this force received
the following fleet order
from Commander in Chief,
Pacific fleet.
'Execute unrestricted.
Repeat. Unrestricted
warfare against Japan.'
The Devilfish will govern
herself accordingly.
Anything we sight, we sink...
without warning.
Gentlemen, the Japs attacked
Pearl Harbor without warning
in the middle of peace talks.
We didn't throw away the rules
of civilized warfare.
They did.
This isn't the war we trained for,
but it's sure the war we've got.
Any further questions?
Prepare all departments
for war patrol
under way for Lingayen Gulf
Byron.
Sir.
Congratulations on your transfer
to Submarine's Atlantic.
I got the dispatch from headquarters
just now signed by Admiral Hart.
Sorry to lose you.
When can you detach me, sir?
Well, not till after this patrol.
You're needed.
What's his problem?
He disapproved my request,
didn't he?
I changed his mind.
Thanks.
Yeah.
You're wrong to go, you know.
Our war's out here.
Lady, my wife and kid may
be caught in Europe.
What can you do about it?
For starters,
I can be 10,000 miles closer.
Just a little while longer, baby.
Oh, there you are.
Are you enjoying the sun, Professor?
What there is of it.
I altered my dress.
Want to try it on?
Thanks. Yes.
Any news from the rumor department
about getting away, Mrs. Olofwsky?
Just the usual-nothing definite.
We should have been
in Palestine by now.
What are you working on, Professor?
This? Oh, just a diary.
Something to pass time
while we wait for us to sail.
I had hoped it was a new book.
It is a new book, Sarah.
Aaron intends to coin this
into publishable copy
on faith, war, the human
predicament, and what not.
Make all the jokes you like.
When a Jew's journey comes up
heading the book of the month
club selection,
something will have been gained
by all this discombobulation.
Just keep watching for Louis,
while I go with Sarah.
It's perfect, Sarah.
I really do love it.
I bought it in Paris-Spring 1938.
Seems like ages ago.
I'll have to pay you for it.
Whatever you think it's worth.
Yes?
Avram.
Mrs. Henry.
I was looking for your uncle.
Oh, he's up on deck.
Oh.
New dress.
Oh, it's Sarah's.
I'm buying it from her.
We'll talk later, Natalie.
I should be going.
She needs money for her family.
And I started to loathe that
everlasting wool dress of mine.
I mean, truly loathe it.
Good choice.
You look very pretty.
Thank you.
Well, what did you want Aaron for?
In Rome, Mrs. Henry,
did the professor know anybody
at the German Embassy?
German Embassy?
I don't know. Why?
Werner Beck? Why, yes.
I did know a Werner Beck years ago.
What about him?
I have a message.
He's coming from Rome.
He's bringing your manuscript,
the Arch of Constantine.
How could that be?
I left it in my hotel room
when we fled.
I never hoped-
Who is he, Aaron?
He was a student in my
last graduate seminar at Yale.
One of the good
German students- demon for work.
I've not heard from him since.
What is he doing
with my manuscript?
How has he managed
to track us here?
It seems rather ominous.
When he arrives,
if we deny you're here,
the Uberalles will
board to search.
They do anything
the Gestapo wants.
When is he do here?
Very soon now.
You do remember me.
Of course, Werner Beck.
You've put on a bit of weight,
that's all.
Yes. Far too much.
Well,
here's the Arch of Constantine.
I can hardly believe it.
Natalie, do you see?
It seems to be all here.
Oh, Werner, I can't thank you enough.
Thank you.
How did you happen
to come by it?
I found it in your hotel room
at the Excelsior.
How did you know we were there,
that we'd come here?
The Gestapo has a list of all foreign
nationals staying in Rome hotels.
So Uberalles reported
to the Gestapo
that you'd boarded this vessel.
Then you're in the Gestapo?
No, Mrs. Henry.
I'm a foreign ministry officer.
Please, allay your fears.
I took the liberty
of reading the work.
Compared with a Jew's Jesus,
it's a great advance.
It's your finest achievement.
How kind of you to say so, Werner.
Your English has
improved considerably.
Remember the trouble
with your orals?
You saved my career.
Oh, hardly so.
Your child is not well?
He's catching a cold.
Oh, that's too bad.
I hoped you and the professor
would have lunch with me
at the Grand Hotel.
They say it has the finest
dining room in Naples.
Leave the ship?
Surely you're not serious, Dr. Beck.
Why not, Mrs. Henry?
I thought you'd enjoy
some good food and wine.
In a few days, you'll start on
a long, rigorous journey.
A few days?
That's more than I know,
I've come from the Harbormaster.
Oh, that's my affirmation.
Now, I have police passes
for you both.
It's really quite safe for you
to come ashore with me.
There is much to discuss.
Werner, what were you doing
in my hotel room?
Professor,
when Mussolini declared war,
I thought I'd better
offer you my hand.
Now, suppose I withdraw
so you can talk it over.
I hope to see you at lunch.
You're not seriously thinking
of going, are you, Aaron?
I'm certainly not.
What do you think, Rabinovitz?
I don't know.
Well, I've always been
a clumsy old dunderhead,
so I may as well follow my nature.
I'll go and take lunch
with Werner Beck.
Enjoy your lunch.
Maybe some of his Gestapo pals will
join you and make things jollier.
Find out all you can
about our departure.
Natalie, if I don't come back,
at least you'll be rid of
one of your millstones.
Sorry you couldn't join us.
It was a marvelous lunch, Mrs. Henry.
Professor, I'll be
hearing from you soon.
I hope the little baby
is feeling better.
Auf Wiedersehen!
Well, my dear,
I'm back, you see-
like a bad penny.
Thank God.
We must speak to Rabinovitz.
Sure you don't want a nap first?
No. I'm not feeling sleepy.
So, was it an interesting lunch,
Professor?
Rather interesting. Yes, it was.
To begin with,
your Turkish captain betrayed you.
He reported our presence here
aboard last week.
The Harbormaster decided
to notify the Ovra in Rome
about the examination
of the American fugitives
before letting you go,
hence the machination.
And what about leaving?
Still a few more days, he says.
And he gave me this.
Those are the Italian
police regulations
for the American internees
to be sent to Siena
to await exchange there.
As it happens, my home is in Siena.
My staff is still living there.
So...
you've made up your mind.
You're getting off
and going to Siena.
I told Werner it's
entirely up to Natalie.
If she wants to sail with you,
I'll sail, too.
If she goes back to Siena,
I'll go with her.
I see.
Very nice.
And what did Doctor Beck
say to that?
Well, Werner said
that as a mother,
he was sure that Natalie
would decide wisely.
But he asked me to point
out to you, Natalie,
that for us the risks of this voyage
are pointless and intolerable.
This ship is not even seaworthy.
The refugees will be entering
Palestine illegally.
The Syrian mountains are full
of bandits and hostile Arabs.
Why take such chances
when we are bona fide Americans
with our papers in order?
He's trying to keep you here, why?
He's hoping to help his teacher.
Will you ever show
any common sense?
He's a high-placed Nazi.
How can you accept his word?
He's not a Nazi.
He's a professional diplomat.
He regards the party
as a pack of gross opportunists.
The anti-Jewish policy appalls him.
However, all that
is neither here nor there.
I stand by my word.
Whatever you decide,
I'll support you fully.
Come in.
We'll talk later.
I have to fuel
and provision the ship.
What is it?
The Harbormaster
has cleared us to leave.
You'll have to decide, Mrs. Henry.
Come with us, Natalie.
You'll be safe and free-
you and your baby.
How many were there
at the start of the march?
More than 10,000.
How am I to build barracks for
They are nothing
but walking corpses.
There are good specimens, too.
Yes. 1 out of 10.
Maybe 1 out of 20.
Besides, I have to use up
Herr Gruppenfuhrer,
may I speak my mind?
By all means.
For 18 months now,
I've put my heart and soul
into building this new camp.
The point is...
what does Reichsfuhrer Himmler
really want of me?
Maximum production
of war material,
or maximum elimination
of the nation's enemies?
I'm a soldier, Herr Gruppenfuhrer.
I'll do either job.
I cannot do both
at the same time.
But why do you suppose
you were chosen?
The Reichsfuhrer knows you
can accomplish the impossible.
He'll see you're richly rewarded.
Of that I assure you.
Thank you.
What will you use
for the special test?
Zykion-b?
An ordinary insecticide?
So simple.
Standard camp issue for fumigation.
Cyanide base.
You're aware we'll have to process
hundreds of thousands-
eventually millions.
It's the Fuhrer's will.
Will the new material
work on such numbers?
I believe it will.
We have already tested it
on smaller numbers.
Besides, what is
the alternative?
The carbon monoxide
used at Treblinka was preposterous.
I could have told them that.
Messy, wasteful of fuel.
And shooting on such a scale...
the psychological effect
on the execution squads
would be unendurable.
Besides, the Reich
has better uses for the ammunition.
So...
you will be testing on 900 POWs.
And on the camp records-what?
When?
Christmas day.
We won't be ready any sooner.
Anyway, what do Godless Bolsheviks
care about Christmas?
Palm...
Palmer, here!
Hi.
Rhoda.
Oh.
Palmer.
You should have your overcoat.
Honey, it's arctic outside.
I put on long johns in Chicago.
Long johns?
Shades of President McKinley.
So how was your trip?
Fine. It was wonderful.
What is this awful
hush-hush thing you're working on?
Oh, good Lord, Palmer,
you're getting as bad as Pug.
Can't you tell me anything?
If we get it first,
we win the war.
If Hitler gets it first,
he wins the world.
Who'll get it first?
As of now, Hitler-hands down.
Look at this, Rhoda. Christmas.
It's got the country half-paralyzed.
Does anyone remember
there's a war on?
Rhoda.
Oh, Palmer.
Oh, Palmer, dear.
Oh, I'm-I'm afraid
I have some bad news, darling.
Madeline's here.
Madeline? Since when?
She dropped in on me
from New York this afternoon.
How long is she staying?
Just for the holidays.
Oh.
Hi, Madeline and Simie.
I'll fix us a drink.
Well, Madeline,
how nice to see you again.
Simon, this is Dr. Palmer Kirby.
He's a good friend of dad's.
Lieutenant Anderson.
Just back from the sea?
No, I'm at Buord
proving grounds.
New weapons section.
Working on anything exciting?
Nothing I can talk about.
You were scaring me
about radioactive bombs
blowing up the world.
Pure theory, Mad.
Not for this war.
We'll see you later, mom.
Aren't you two
going to eat here?
Uh-uh. We'll grab a bite
before the movies.
Well, have a nice evening.
Bye-bye.
Bye. It's very cold out there.
Good night.
Black. Right?
Yes, that's right.
Oh, Rhoda.
You certainly know
how to spoil a man.
Why, thank you, Palmer.
Palmer, I have something to tell you.
I wrote Pug about a month ago
and asked for a divorce.
Now, darling, listen,
you're free as air.
I'm not sure I ever
want to marry again.
l...
I'm-I'm in such
a terrible turmoil.
When he got to California,
I thought he might ask me to come
and set up house in Honolulu.
I simply couldn't face
leaving you, so I did it.
And now it's done.
What reason did you
give him, Rhoda?
I simply told him
we had been seeing each other,
and I'd fallen hopelessly in love.
It was wrong not to tell him.
Has he answered you yet?
Yes.
A lovely, heartbreaking letter.
Let me see it.
Are you sure that's what you want?
Please. I want to see it, Rhoda.
What's the matter, dear?
Nothing.
I still have a report
to write tonight.
It is awkward, isn't it?
I mean, Madeline
being here and all.
Palmer.
Palmer, uh...
Palmer, take me
to your apartment.
Is that what you really want?
Oh...oh, what do you think, you fool?
Don't you?
Can't you get anything right?
I never said that.
Oh, perhaps I did.
This is going to be
worst than Ceylon.
We're going down
into a bloody inferno.
Looks like a peaceful
little inferno to me.
Where are the 'vast fortress walls,
the masses of cannons,
the swarms of spitfires
and hurricanes?'
That doesn't show, naturally.
Believe me, this little green scorpion
of an island down there
packs a hell of a sting.
I look as if I've
been digging a ditch.
So, Philip Rule is meeting us.
Oh, the swine cabled me in Ceylon.
Damn able correspondent, Philip.
Talky, I finished
with him long ago.
23
Hello, Tudsburys.
Philip, just in time.
How are you, Tudsbury?
Welcome to the
bastion of the empire.
I'm overwhelmed.
Well, don't be.
They grow by the roadside.
Mr. Alistair Tudsbury?
Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham
invites you for a tour
of the island's defenses.
Oh, I accept.
My car will be waiting
for you outside customs.
You do rate
with the high brass, Talky.
Imagine a journalist
receiving that offer.
What happened to your hand?
I went on maneuvers with the Argyll
and Sutherland highlanders.
Got bitten...by a centipede.
It was a nasty brute,
about a foot long.
Didn't know whether to kiss it
or kill it.
Still playing your
Hemingway act, eh?
Nasty, nasty. Come along.
I'll whisk you
through formalities,
then I'll book you into raffles.
What are you sending
to the express?
My sources say our lads
are smashing the Japs.
That's the official line, Talky.
The rumors filtering down
the Peninsula aren't quite so rosy.
Looks peaceful.
This is the residential section.
We are east of Suez.
Where are the British, Phil?
You'll meet them tonight
at the Tanglin Club,
Governor's reception for whites only.
Governor's reception?
For the celebrated Alistair Tudsbury.
You'll get a chance to meet
all the calcified Pukka Sahibs
responsible for sweating and
oppressing half a billion Asiatics
in the name of God
and the British empire.
So, Tudsy, tell me about this U.S.
naval captain Victor Henry.
Who's that?
Oh, come, come.
People talk,
especially the Moscow press corps.
You and this yank lovers?
None of your bloody business.
As long as we're on the subject,
how's the little wife?
God knows.
Last I heard, she was working
in a factory outside Moscow
making tank turrets
out of borscht or something.
The idea of you married,
and to a Russian ballerina.
You always were full of surprises.
It was the only way
into her knickers.
Beautiful girl, Tudsbury,
but prim as an Anglican
Bishop's wife.
A Yank, Tudsy,
and, I hear, over 50.
You must tell me.
What's the appeal?
Among other qualities, Phil,
he's as little like you
as anyone could possibly imagine.
He's decent to the bone.
Ah, the charm of novelty.
This war will be won.
Though it may well entail further
grizzly sacrifices for mankind.
But after what I have seen today,
thanks to the generous cooperation
of Air Chief Marshall,
Brooke Poppum,
this is what I'm going to say tonight
when I broadcast to England,
the empire and the world.
Fortress Singapore is ready.
Fortress Singapore doesn't
expect a tea party
but it is well prepared
for its uninvited guests.
Let the rest of the world be assured
the Japanese will not enjoy,
if they ever
get near enough to taste it,
the bitter brew that awaits
them at Fortress Singapore.
Morning sir.
Good morning Byron.
Good morning Skipper.
Good morning Byron.
How much longer till Lingayen?
I'm taking her down Lady.
Pull the plug
as soon as we are below.
Aye, aye sir.
Clear the bridge.
Let's move it.
Let's get going.
Get going.
Green board.
Bleed air.
Pure air.
Green board,
pressure in the boat.
Very well take it up
one, two, five feet.
Let me know
when you get it.
One, two five.
One, two, five aye.
I relieve you Briny.
I stand relieved sir.
I want you to go forward and check
the new torpedo explosives.
Aye, aye.
Full negative to the mark.
Bridge circuit is secure sir.
Very well give me
a nine-degree down bubble.
Now line it up.
Hey guys.
Hello sir.
How we doing Hans?
We had to load all six bow tubes
with of warheads Mr. Henry.
Allfish routine.
Floaters are ready
for insertion.
Well let's get at it.
Tracking party
to the conning tower Mr. Henry.
What's going on?
The captain wants you
to take the dive
so that Mr. Turkell
can man the TDC.
We're in silent running.
We have a contact?
Your damn right.
There's crew noises
all over this ocean.
We're inside Lingayen.
Lady, when did all this break.
We picked up these clowns on sonar
at about nine thousand yards
all of a sudden we must have come
out from underneath a thermal layer.
I want you to take the dive.
I'm going to go back up
to the conning tower.
Very well,
I'll relieve you sir.
And I stand relieved.
We are at one,
twenty-five running silent.
I only had one-third and for once
Foof left you with a good trim.
Sure sounds like
a mess of them.
Yeah like the whole
damn Jap landing force.
Now Briny listen carefully.
I'm going to raise number one
periscope all the way.
I want you to come to exactly
sixty-six feet and level off.
And then another foot and level off
just the way we did on that
last practice run on the Litchfield.
Nice and easy, you know?
Aye aye sir.
Take it up sixty-six feet.
Zero bubble.
Six-six feet sir.
Very well.
Up scope.
Make it up six-five feet.
Six-five feet sir.
Very well.
That's it hold it.
Wow unbelievable.
Mark?
Leaving AP. Mark?
Second A.P. Mark?
Third A.P. Mark?
Down scope.
Target angle on the bow.
Forty starboard -
range about ten thousand yards.
C.B.C.
Will track the first transport.
Give me the normal approach course,
all ahead standard.
This is the captain.
We've got three big
transports in column,
screened by three destroyers,
off our starboard bow.
The rising sun is flapping
plain as day on all of them.
This is it.
Flood the bow tubes.
All tubes flooded sir.
Very well.
They're still beyond
torpedo range, Captain.
They are now
but they're zig-zagging
and when they zig back
they will be in range.
All ahead 1/3.
Answering all ahead 1/3.
Up scope.
Okay, here they come.
They are zigging back.
Get ready to shoot.
They're still
in outside range, Captain.
I'll use slow setting Zen?
I'm going to shoot.
Open outer doors.
Lead transport bearing.
Mark?
Range. Mark?
Down scope.
Angle on the bow
seventy starboard.
Now all hands I intend to shoot four bow tubes
at those three big
overlapping transports.
Set depth thirty feet all tubes.
Acknowledge sir.
Very well.
Up scope.
Target bearing.
Mark?
Range. Mark?
Down scope.
Angle on the bow
ninety starboard.
Solution light,
shoot anytime Captain.
Fire one.
One fired electrically.
Number one fired
electrically sir.
Fire two.
Number two fired
electrically sir.
Fire three.
Number three fired
electrically sir.
Fire four.
Number four fired
electrically sir.
All fish are running
toward target sir.
Very well.
Up scope.
All wakes running hot,
straight and normal.
Beautiful.
Down scope.
Nineteen seconds
till impact Captain.
Fifteen, fourteen...
No, it has to be.
Ah, up scope.
Scope's been up
fourteen seconds.
Down scope.
Four misses.
Lady, four.
These two wakes had to go
right under the lead transport.
In spite of the wakes that near
destroyer is coming right at us
with a hell of a bone in its teeth.
All ahead full.
Answering all ahead full sir.
Bradley emergency give me
two hundred and fifty feet.
What's he talking
about Mr. Henry?
Lingayen is no deeper
than hundred seventy.
We're going to hit bottom
like a ton of bricks.
All hands rig for depth
charge on the double.
On that dive order, Captain I think
you mean a hundred and fifty feet.
That's about down to the mud here.
Oh right. Thanks Lady.
Byron make that
one hundred fifty feet.
One five zero aye sir.
Passing one hundred feet.
Take it up one five zero feet.
Below negative to four thousand.
One five zero sir.
Well, what course Captain?
Course? Oh yeah... huh?
Left full rudder come to, ah...
make it two, seven, zero.
Left to two, seven, zero sir.
Depth charge.
Hold on.
Foof hit it with a torch.
Captain, we got our depth crank in.
We're getting creamed.
Let's take her up to fifty-five feet
and give them a knuckle.
Take her up
to fifty-five feet.
Fifty-five feet aye sir.
Give me a ten up, no more.
Four degree down
till we past six, zero feet.
Floor auxiliaries from cease,
eight hundred pounds.
Leveled off at five,
five feet sir.
Very well.
Everything okay down there?
Seems to be sir.
Now all hands we've seemed
to have give them the slip for now.
Congratulations on bringing
the Devilfish
through her first enemy attack.
Make depth sixty-five feet.
Lady, Foof,
let's look at the chart.
Lady what do you think?
Well I'd say he's
heading for the beach.
Yeah why's that?
Because he probably knows
that we're still trying
for the landing area.
Well if you're right
that's just great.
Because we're heading
for the entrance.
The entrance?
Of course.
The whole landing area will be
on full submarine alert now.
We can't accomplish anything here
but up at the entrance
we might find some fat pickings.
All right,
Foof you relieve Briny.
Lady you and Briny
take a look around the boat.
Let me have a full damage report
as quickly as possible.
Lady?
Aye, aye sir.
No, no you tell me why he's not
going after those transports.
Take it easy Briny.
He knows what's he doing.
He does?
Yes, you heard him say
that our torpedo attack
put the landing force
on full sub alert.
The landing force has to be on
full sub alert anyway you know that.
We're still loaded
with twenty fish and he's running.
What the hell
are we out here for?
He's zigging again.
Range is sixty-five hundred.
Ready to relieve.
He's back with us.
Were at eight, zero feet
and 1/3 speed.
Very well I relieve you sir.
I stand relieved.
Sonar's got them
at six thousand yards.
He's already completed
two tight squares.
It looks like he's about
to take a wider sweep.
What do you think Chief?
Well it's a pretty
dark ocean up there
but if he carries out the right search
pattern he could pick us up again.
Range five thousand and closing.
Lady let's take a look.
Steve, keep feeding plot
we're going below.
Aye, aye, sir.
He's right there sir
and he's making another turn.
Well maybe we should
change course Captain.
Come right...
Negative.
We're continuing
toward the entrance.
Where the pickings are.
Hold course, speed and depth.
He may not pick up
an echo at all.
The Litchfield didn't
pass us at three thousand
when we were on the bottom.
Why don't we at least
pop the scope up?
Maybe the weather's lousy
top side and we could surface
and run the hell out of here with
our diesels at twenty-one knots.
The batteries
are pretty low Captain.
Not much juice left
for underwater evasion.
Damn it Lady what if the weather
isn't lousy up there?
We're up moon from them.
Even our attack periscope might
show up in his binoculars.
He's turning towards us sir.
Well maybe he picked up
a school of fish... or something.
Range four thousand.
Speed thirty knots.
Range thirty-five hundred.
Collision course Captain.
Rig for depth charge.
Rig for silent running.
Emergency give me
one hundred feet.
Take it up one hundred feet.
All ahead full flood negative.
Retrack the sonar heads.
I'm going to the bottom.
You're bottoming Captain.
That's the way I shook off
the Litchfield remember?
His sonar couldn't screen out
the bottom return.
We're an extremis
it's our best chance.
Give me a fathometer reading.
Have all hands
prepare to bottom.
Right.
Full rudder.
Will it work?
Well it depends.
On what?
How good the Japs sonar is.
All right level off.
All stop.
Answering all stop.
On the bottom sir
is nine, seven feet.
Very well.
Shut down everything
but top side sonar.
Top side sonar report
is dead overhead Captain.
It's too close
for a good bearing now.
My God it's working.
He's gone by us sir.
How are we on air?
Forty hours Captain.
Okay.
We'll just lie here
until he fades off.
He's coming back Mr. Henry.
He's coming back sir.
Nothing to worry about.
Nothing to worry
about down there.
Bottom return
blanks out his sonar.
We know that now.
Secure that valve.
Let's see some hands over here.
I'm taking her up.
Blow all ballast
surface, surface, surface.
Byron I'm taking her up
to sixty-five feet.
Blow negative. Maximum up angle.
All head full.
Six, five aye sir.
Make it up six, five feet below
negative mark, ten degree up.
All compartments
report damage.
High speed propeller sir
approaching from the entrance.
One bearing three, zero, zero.
The other bearing
one, two, zero.
Speed twenty knots.
Mr. Aster two more destroyers.
Periscope depth Briny
but be ready to flood negative
and get me down fast.
Six, five, aye sir
making up six,
five feet below
negative the mark.
Ten up bubble.
Level off at six, five feet.
Leveling off
at six, five feet sir.
Up scope.
Hot damn.
It's raining, it's pouring.
We're right in the middle
of a damn squall.
Black as a cow's inside.
Prepare to surface
four main engines.
Prepare to surface
four main engines.
Tell maneuvering room to stand by
to make twenty-one knots.
Ready to surface sir.
Surface! Surface! Surface!
Blow bubble.
Blow main ballast.
Lay up to the conning tower
on the double.
Briny come up here a minute.
What happened?
He got knocked off his feet
in the darkness.
I just wanted you to see
why I was giving orders.
Is he all right?
I don't know.
Doc come here
have a look at him.
Aye, aye sir.
What do you think?
Okay guys listen up.
Sonar reports that the destroyers
are rapidly opening the range
and it looks like
we've shaken them off.
Now I'm sure you already know
that during the last barrage
the captain was badly hurt.
Doc Halston says he's got
a concussion that it seems serious.
So what it means is that the Devilfish
is going to have to return to base.
I know you guys feel
as badly as I do
but the Captain just
isn't up to conducting attacks
and he can't delegate command.
Well how do we get out
Lady and when?
On the surface Foof.
Straight down the middle
of twenty-one knots
at approximately forty minutes.
On the surface?
Yeah.
I know Billy.
It's a tough one.
Destroyers and sub chasers
are going to be as thick
as whores on market street.
You see on the other hand
we've got zero visibility top side
the entrance is twelve miles wide
and at flank speed
we can run through
and get away in fifteen minutes.
Any comments?
That's the way to go.
All right then that's that.
I secured for a while to allow
the crew to get a sandwich
and hit the head.
You mean there's
a sailor on this boat
who hasn't already
pissed in his pants.
All right back to battle.
We're passing through
the entrance right now Lady.
Sonar reports screw noises and echo
ranging all around us Mr. Aster.
Start patrol maneuvers.
No collision courses.
No sign they've picked us up.
Just goes to show you
ignorance is bliss.
Here we are absolutely ringed
by the yellow bastards
and its like a pleasure cruise.
Let's just hope we don't ram one.
What's up?
Hi Briny close the curtain.
So how do you like
submarine duty so far?
Listen to me carefully.
There's nothing wrong
with the Captain
except that he's absolutely
scared out of his mind.
What?
No concussion?
No. He confessed to Doc Halston
and the doc told me.
I can't believe it.
He just can't hack it Briny.
The doc had to put him
to sleep with a sedative.
Does anyone else know?
No.
And I'm going to back his story.
The truth will come
out soon enough.
Meantime we're returning to the barn
with our tail between our legs
and that's poison for the crew.
So if we make a contact
on the way back
I'm going to ask
the Captain's permission to shoot.
You're damn right.
Foof will be my kibitzer sir.
You'll man the TDC.
Me?
Lady I've never ran
the TDC on patrol.
So what?
You did a damn good job
on the attack trainer.
Anyway there's nobody else.
Who is it?
It's Phil Rule.
Phil my God.
Pam this is
Major Denton Sharp.
How do you do Mrs. Tudsbury?
Come in.
Do you have any brandy?
Major Sharpe?
Yes please.
Bless me Phil you're drowned.
Major Denton Sharpe...
Alastair Tudsbury.
My dear fellow...
Panang has fallen
we've just come from there.
That far south.
All Malay's is falling
it's a route.
I caught some of your
broadcasts up country.
Criminal lies Tudsbury
well how can you still suck up
to these incompetent,
mendacious bastards?
Who've botched this job
and lost the empire,
not that it was worth saving.
I told the truth.
Phil.
Such as I could find out.
Your truth is rule
Brittannia Drivel.
You might as well let government
house make your dispatches.
Phil please.
I say jolly good brandy.
Don't mind Phil
he's got the wind up.
He's never been through
a retreat like this.
Well if Malay isn't gone
we can still defeat
these little bastards.
Well I don't agree with you
there Denton but listen to him.
At least he'll give you
something real to report.
Do you have a map of Malay
about Tudsbury?
Yes, of course.
That hand looks awful.
Yeah I had some imbecile
army medico Lance at Jitra.
I hope I don't lose it.
I could have a touch
of blood poisoning.
I'm shaking all over.
You always
were a real hypochondriac.
You've always looked naughty
in a nightie.
Than I shall put on
my dressing gown.
But despite the poor performance
of our Asiatic troops
we've still got
the edge Tudsbury.
If the top brass ever
awakens from its funk, if.
The trick is to use delaying
tactics to force the enemy
to using up
his ammunition and supplies.
Meanwhile, our main forces
fall back to two very strong lines.
One here in Jahore
and the other here
along the north shore
of Singapore lsland itself.
Now there's still time
to build those defenses.
What with the labor pool of nearly
two million Chinese and Malayans.
What are you talking about?
The north shore is impregnable.
I've seen the defenses myself.
Well you're wrong.
There's nothing on the north shore
of this island but marsh.
They probably showed you
the walls of the naval base.
Are you telling me that BBC
has been lied to
by the highest officials
of this city?
Oh my dear fellow
one uses you.
Why do you suppose I'm here?
But don't feel badly,
Churchill himself has been lied to.
There's not one man to tell him that
fortress Singapore never did exist.
The empire is teetering
in the balance Tudsbury.
That's not journalism
that's the military fact.
We can win here
but we must get cracking.
Very well.
If what you say is true
I've led myself to this
governments suicidal sham.
I shall broadcast your story.
Really?
Smashing.
They won't let you broadcast
out of Singapore Talky.
The Governor and Brooke Poppum.
Popham will put you behind bars
before that happens.
Very well, I shall go to Australia.
I'll leave in the morning.
Yes that might work.
You better stay here dear
and keep an eye on things.
Well, Phillip I thank you
and take care of that hand.
I shall be listening
for your broadcast, up country.
Oh don't bother to see me out.
Well, you'll be in Australia then
for Christmas and I'll be here.
I know but what is to be done?
The war,
this story must go on the air.
What if the Japanese show up
before you get back?
Nonsense.
Do you think I'd abandon you?
The little beggars are still
three hundred miles up country.
Oh well good.
I mean given the choice
I'd rather not be raped by platoons
of slavering Orientals.
Well now that's settled.
You won't mind if I stretch out
here on the couch.
I've got to get to a doctor
with this hand in the morning.
You could have Pam's bed.
We shall be up all the night
writing this story.
Draw him a hot bath dear
and then let's get to work.
Follow me.
Ah yes.
Ah yes Tudsey.
I can see this being very,
very cozy in here
until the old gasbag gets back.
Not bloody likely.
All right now Tudsbury
now let's talk about it.
Well what finally
finishes off in Paris?
I mean it all got very blurry.
Was it the waitresses?
Low taste I admit
but an amiable weakness?
Not the waitresses Phil.
Not even the whores.
The Yale boy.
Oh yes.
Young Antinous.
School boy lapse.
Nothing to get upset about.
You're hopeless.
I do my best though.
But you do realize
you will be alone here
if those slavering whores
do make a sudden break through.
If you're feeling lonely
on Christmas Eve
I'll be staying with some friends
of mine in McMahons.
They'll be having a do.
On that I may take you up.
Don't think I could stand to be
in Singapore alone on Christmas Eve.
Closing shop is right.
When do you think the
Japanese will get through?
What the devil, Pamela?
Come get at the typewriter,
let's go.
Ausweis bitte danke.
I have already
offered twice to resign.
What can he do to me?
You must not resign.
I am sick.
Yes it's the most colossal mistake
yet was to declare war on America.
Yeah.
Why? Why?
Perhaps, the treaty
with the Japanese.
But is there Japanese
attacking the United States?
So there was no
treaty obligations.
He's an adventurer.
He acts on impulse.
If only he will listen.
Going on the defensive in
the Soviet Union is the main thing.
Then in the Spring.
There's a smashing
new offensive.
We maybe able to win
some kind of peace.
Who is responsible
for this driveling nonsense?
As ordered my Fuhrer.
The Eastern front strategy
to knock England out of the war.
What has England
to do with this?
Filthy rubbish.
General, withdrawal in the east
your positions?
The front straightened
and shortened.
New front line chosen with
an eye to easy quartering
and simplified supply problems.
Ah yes you gentlemen
of the officer core
with your Von's before your names.
You never dusted your
polished boots in a trench,
the kind of trench I served in for four years.
Always looking for an easy war,
for simple war.
While you snicker behind my back
at the Bohemian Corporal
who knows from bitter experience
from lying gassed in a field
hospital that war is hard!
Vain soft, cowardly wretches,
beneath contempt.
I repeat my request
to be permitted to resign.
Yes now!
Now that you have ruined
my eastern campaign
I designed it with crystal clarity
it was bound to lead to victory
if you had done as you were told
and driven for the Caucasus oil.
But no you knew better.
You and your generals
had to march on Moscow.
You wanted your
prestige successes.
Fool!
Weak!
Nincompoop.
There will be no withdrawal
on the eastern front.
That's final!
Every German soldier will
hold or die where he stands!
My wermacht will not turn
it's back on the Russians
and fall to pieces
like Napoleon's grand army.
I beg you...
let me resign.
Resign!
You are dismissed!
Herr Von Brauchitsch from your post,
from my armed forces,
from all further service
to the fatherland
that you tried to betray
with this!
Treasonist filth!
You... will remain.
This little affair
of operational command
is something anyone can do.
The task of the Commander In Chief
is to educate the army
in national Socialism.
I know of no General who can do it,
as I want it done.
Therefore, I shall take over
command of the army myself.
Yes Mien Fuhrer.
I shall require
a Chief of Staff of course.
If you wish to resign I will permit it.
If you want to remain at your post
you may.
For now that is all.
A Corporal, a Corporal
relieving a Field Marshall.
The time may be coming
to relieve the Corporal.
Never say it
never think it.
The time has passed.
He is a fate of Germany
and fate cannot be state.
I shall resign, too.
No. No. You are professional.
He will listen to you.
I'm a scapegoat for his Russian folly
and that's that, so be it.
For the sake of the fatherland
stay at his side,
try to curb the mistakes,
the excesses.
Hope for a turn in the tide.
The horrors now being committed.
We all have blood on our hands.
Yeah, the Jews.
It has only begun.
What about my grand strategy
memorandum for the President?
Twenty-five single-spaced pages,
Prime Minister - much to digest.
But I have digested it.
Germany first.
Correct.
Japan's thrust into Southeast Asia
may well spell for us a disaster,
but America's entry into the war
can make amends for all.
I shall press my views on President
Roosevelt with all my force.
All my force.
Germany first.
Despite the Pearl Harbor debacle,
Germany first.
Winston,
we have always talked softly
and diplomatically
with the Americans.
Yah...
we talked like that
while we were wooing her.
Now that she's in the harem,
we talk to her quite differently.
By the by, gentlemen,
we'll light the White House
Christmas tree shortly.
You're all invited to the ceremony.
immediately thereafter, to eggnog.
That's very nice, Mr. President.
A productive meeting, Winston.
Mr. President, we've discussed
many great issues,
but not the greatest.
Not yet.
Mr. President, is it still
to be Germany first?
Here's the view
of my Joint Chiefs on that.
It's quite short.
'At American-British
staff talks in February,
it was agreed that Germany was
the predominant member of the axis
and Europe,
the decisive theater.
Much has happened since then.
Not withstanding Japan's
entry into the war,
our view remains that Germany
is still the prime enemy,
and her defeat
is the key to victory.'
Thank God.
'Once Germany is defeated,
'the collapse of ltaly
and the defeat of Japan will follow.'
Franklin, we shall have that evil man.
I believe we shall, Winston.
Come. You'll throw the switch
and light the tree.
And perhaps you'll
say a word or two.
That would be a great honor.
All set with your speech
for Congress?
I'm somewhat nervous.
Not you.
How will you start?
Well, I shall say that
if my father had been American
and my mother English-
instead of the reverse-
I might have got here on my own.
You'll do well.
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining us
in this annual tree-lighting
ceremony this evening.
Standing beside me is one
of the great leaders in the world.
He and his people have pointed
the way, in courage and in sacrifice,
for the benefit of little
children everywhere.
And I'm asking my associate,
my old and good friend, and yours,
to say a word to the people
of America tonight.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain,
Winston Churchill.
This is a strange Christmas Eve.
Almost the entire world
is locked in deadly struggle.
So, with the most terrible weapons
science can devise,
with the nations' advance
upon each other.
Yet, let the children have
their night of fun and laughter.
Then we turn again to the stern task
and the formidable years,
in God's mercy.
A happy Christmas to you all.
And now, for the ninth time,
we'll light the living
community Christmas tree
of our nation's capital.
Mr. Prime Minister,
if you please.
Pamela.
Elsa.
Where are you going?
Talky's broadcasting
from Australia at 8:00.
Thought I'd catch it with Phil.
Oh, dear Phil.
He is improving, isn't he?
He will never improve.
I won't be long.
Well.
Was it worth it?
Who knows?
I doubt anybody that counts
will take it seriously.
It's not the kind of news
they want to hear.
Well, is Singapore full?
Oh, I fear so, darling.
Up country the men want to fight.
They're trying.
Then the orders come.
Fall back, retreat.
I've seen men cry over those orders.
How am I going to get out of here?
Oh, you'll get out.
There are vessels waiting to evacuate
white women and children.
You don't believe in
the American rescue mission
everyone's talking about?
Wishful fantasy.
The entire American fleet
was destroyed at Pearl Harbor.
No one knows what happened
at Peal Harbor.
Denton Shairpe knows.
They lost all eight battleships.
The Americans are finished.
What's the matter, Pam?
Oh, you're thinking about your Yank.
Was he on a battleship?
Denton Shairpe didn't know
the extent of the casualties.
Maybe he's alive.
They were sunk in shallow water.
Aah!
What's that?
Oh, no. Don't panic.
That's just our resident
apricot monkey.
He comes and goes
through the trees-
harmless despite
that dreadful racket.
I hate Singapore.
I would have hated it
even in peace time.
Let the Japanese have it.
I'm going back up to the house.
You all right?
Is there anything you need?
I might be a bit lonely perhaps.
But don't let that
stop you having fun.
Run along.
Go back to your effete,
doomed pukka sahibs.
Those boring young Lieutenants.
I simply don't care to be rude.
The McMahons will think I climbed
into bed with a sick man.
Why don't you, Pam?
Truly, that's a charming idea.
I mean,
being Christmas Eve and all.
Come, Tudsbury.
You're such a bastard, Phil.
You haven't changed a bit.
Oh. Darling, I was born
into a rotten system.
I'm merely a reflection of it.
When everything's breaking up,
the only thing left is pleasure.
You believe in that.
I take my pleasures lightly.
You insist on drama.
That won't change, but, despite all...
I do love you.
What about your wife?
Just curious.
At least in Paris,
you didn't have a wife.
Oh, Sweetie.
I don't even know
if she's alive.
I hope she's bonking
the brains out of some nice,
young, deserving Russian lad.
Don't forget your brolly.
Aufstehen! Aufstehen!
Get up, you Russian swine!
Heraus! Aus!
Get up, get up.
Get up!
Take the dead out.
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer,
the 900 political commissars
are mustered.
March them to the hygienic facility...
for delousing.
Zu befehl,
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.
Herr Obersturmfuhrer,
this just came from
Master Sergeant Klinger.
All right, be quick about it.
Get another one, double-quick.
Which one?
The one with typhus.
He's croaking anyway.
Back to the blockhouse!
Come with me.
Where are we going?
Shut up, or it will be
the worse for you!
Wait here.
How long has it been since
your son's beautiful wedding?
Ohh...a thousand years.
But...l didn't know
you were here, too.
Oh, yes.
Since they opened the camp.
I arranged your transfer.
But how?
This isn't even a Russian
prisoner blockhouse.
Shh! There are ways.
Now you're a member
of my construction gang.
I'm the foreman.
Our boss is Sergeant Major Klinger.
We do good work for him...
he treats us okay.
Even in Auschwitz,
it is possible to survive.
Dive! Dive!
Green board!
Bleed air!
Hey, chief.
Mr. Henry.
Billy, what's up?
Sonar's picked up slow screws
at about 10,000 yards.
Aster's going after it.
Yeah.
Hey, guys.
Having a good time?
This could be it.
Gentlemen, let's see
if he's in view yet.
Up scope.
Target-generated bearing, 032.
Well, well, well.
There he is, right on.
Bearing. Mark?
O32.
Range. Mark?
Down scope.
Angle on the bow, 27 port.
Right on, Billy.
He's there, over the hill.
Haul down.
Go to battle stations.
Submerge.
Sound general alarm.
All crew, battle stations.
Submerge.
What is it?
Generator N-6-500, sir.
Up scope.
Target bearing 021.
Range! Mark?
Bearing. Mark?
Down scope.
Angle on the bow, 34,
it's a medium-sized tanker,
about 5,000 tons.
Normal approach course, Byron.
Normal approach. 140, sir.
Helmsman, left to 140.
Left to 140, sir.
All ahead, full.
Make 8 knots.
Flood tubes three and four.
Aye, aye, sir.
All tubes flooded.
All hands, the Devilfish
is commencing an attack on a tanker.
These new magnetic exploders
are lousy, Briny.
Torpedo room.
Set all tubes 6-foot depth.
Repeat. 6-foot depth.
Forward torpedo room.
Set all tubes 6-foot depth.
All ahead 1/3.
Answering. All ahead 1/3.
Up scope!
He's closing fast.
Down scope!
Give me a course for a 90-track.
Right to 150, sir.
Open outer doors.
Coming right to 150.
Open outer doors.
Generator range, 1-200.
We have a solution light.
Very well, Briny. Up scope.
This will be the final bearing.
Mark?
Down scope.
We're right on.
Distance to track - 800 yards.
Fire three!
Number three fired
electrically, sir.
Fire four!
Number four fired
electrically, sir.
Torpedo run to target,
Both fish running out
straight and normal.
Up scope.
Two wakes.
Dead on.
Whoo! Yay! Yay!
Whoo!
All gone.
God, what a sight!
Put the camera on here!
That's beautiful!
That's magnificent!
It just takes one.
It's a successful patrol.
Well done, Briny, well done.
Get a couple more, then look.
What a sight!
Everybody have a look!
Everybody in the attack party.
Come on up from down there, guys.
Have a look in this thing.
Here, Briny.
Now eyeball that!
Wow!
How about that?
A perfect solution. Perfect!
He's going to burn
for a while there.
Briny, you're the hottest
TDC operator in the South China Sea.
Foof, have a look.
Two out of two.
Have you ever seen anything
more beautiful?
Never seen anything
half as beautiful!
You bet you haven't.
Merry Christmas.
Now you got a story
to tell Natalie, huh?
Thank you for waiting for me,
Natalie.
It's cold and windy up on deck.
Let me give you some coffee.
Thank you.
How's your baby?
Cranky. He keeps pawing
at his ear, and he's feverish.
Sugar?
No, thank you.
Sit.
So...
are you coming with us?
I'm trying to make up my mind.
That shouldn't be hard.
Decide what's the best
for yourself and do it.
Listen, the Italians have no use for
a lot of hungry and stateless Jews.
We'll go, Mrs. Henry.
You should come, too.
I should?
Why?
Perhaps because your baby is Jewish
and should go
to the Jewish homeland.
Don't you understand...
I feel no emotion
about Palestine. None.
I'm an American,
completely irreligious,
married to a Christian naval officer.
Tell me about your husband.
Well, he's on a submarine
in the Pacific somewhere.
I haven't seen him in ages.
That was my wife.
She was killed in a bus
that the Arabs blew up.
That's awful.
It happened eight years ago.
And you want me
to bring my baby there?
Jews live in danger everywhere.
Not in America.
There are no boats to America.
Here's my husband Byron.
It was taken on our honeymoon
in Lisbon.
It lasted all of two days.
He looks young. When was this?
A million years ago,
it seems like.
No-l mean, yes,
he's young, but...
he's exceptional.
Byron has a marvelous knack for, I don't know,
for getting things done.
You'd have to meet him.
Bring your son to Palestine.
He'll grow up to be a man
of action like his father.
You know, Werner Beck's
coming in the morning,
just in case we decide
to leave the ship.
Yes, I know.
Steady.
I'm sorry.
The wind keeps backing around.
The weather report is not good.
Still, we sail
with the first light.
That may solve my problem.
Maybe Beck won't be here that early.
Oh, he will come, all right.
Yes?
Sorry to interrupt.
The baby's behaving
rather strangely.
Uh...convulsions. Hmm.
It is this inflamed left ear.
A febrile episode.
Don't worry, Natalie.
Infants come out of convulsions.
The doctor will give him something.
Unfortunately,
for this there's no medicine.
What about a warm bath?
Yes. Yes, this could help.
But there's no hot water
on this boat.
Come. The galley.
Fortunately,
soup is the mainstay of our diet.
Feel that.
Too warm?
No.
When my baby brother
went into a convulsion,
that's what my mother
always did.
Get some on his head, too.
Come along, my dear.
My God, Natalie, you're not
really leaving the boat,
putting yourself in the hands
of that German?
My baby's sick as hell.
I know babies' fevers
are frightening,
but it's amazing how they recover,
throw them off.
A few days at sea, and you'll
be safe in the Jewish homeland.
We appreciate your concern,
but Natalie's
already made a decision.
This ship will be 10 days at sea.
There will be weeks
in the wild Syrian mountains.
And also, the Turks or British may
stop the boat and send it back.
Okay, let me help you.
You're very kind.
Let your uncle get off,
if he insists.
He's had his life.
Not you and Lewis.
Listen to me, darling.
Sarah, you're not helping.
I suppose we oughtn't to keep
Werner waiting, Natalie.
Mrs. Henry.
Professor.
I'm so pleased that you made
the right decision.
Well, Dr. Jastrow...goodbye.
Goodbye, Rabinovitz.
Perhaps we shall meet again.
Am I doing the right thing?
It's done.
Mrs. Henry, do you remember the
last line from the Passover seder?
