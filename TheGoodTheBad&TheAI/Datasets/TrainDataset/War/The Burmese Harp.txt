THE SOIL OF BURMA IS RED,
AND SO ARE ITS ROCKS...
Why don't we sing?
Singing is meant
for times like these.
Mizushima...
play your harp.
- Kobayashi, watch these.
- All right.
PFC Mizushima reporiting.
I'm leaving now to scout ahead.
- Thanks.
- I'll signal on the harp, as usual.
I'll play "Danger" if I see anything,
"All Clear" if it's okay to advance.
You look better like that
than in uniform.
He looks Burmese.
You should settle down here.
The natives would love you.
Me Burmese.
Burma nice country.
What's taking him so long?
Shall we send out
a second scout?
- The harp!
- Mizushima's playing the harp.
Which tune is it?
You still can't tell?
It's the "All Clear."
I always confuse them.
Sarge has a tin ear, huh?
Move out!
- What happened?
- Did a fox cast a spell on you?
- Some thieves cornered me.
- Thieves?
What did they take?
What could they take?
All he had on was a
- They took my
- And wrapped you in banana leaves?
They gave me these.
They had quite a few.
They held me up and asked me to
exchange the  for banana leaves.
What a polite holdup!
You look even better
in those leaves.
With a gold collar,
you'd look just like a cannibal.
A banana waist cloth
keeps you cool.
Where's the village chief?
Can you see the Himalayas?
Not from here.
The sutras and tradition tell us
that the Himalayas
are the home of the soul.
We long to see them,
even if just once.
Your playing has gotten
very good recently.
Not at all.
You should just settle here and play.
You've always said you love Burma.
I want to go home to Japan.
Japan...
Your hospitality was quite unexpected.
We thank you.
We'll sing a song of gratitude.
"Setting Sail," first verse.
I knew it was
too good to be true.
- Stay put!
- The ammo boxes!
Nobody move.
Is it the British?
Sing! They're forming
a line in the woods.
We'll make them think
we don't know they're there.
Get ready for action
as we sing.
Clap your hands!
Laugh!
They could attack
at any moment.
Night's falling.
We need to keep them off guard.
Laugh and clap your hands!
What about the ammo boxes?
One shot
and they'll all explode.
One shot and we'll be
blown to pieces.
O merciful Buddha...
False alarm.
They're not the enemy.
Wait!
Listen.
The song's in English.
We have surrendered.
Not only us,
but our country as well.
I'm not sure
what to make of this.
We don't know where we'll be taken,
what we'll have to do,
or even if we'll be
allowed to live.
All of Japan has been
heavily bombed.
Many are dead.
Many are homeless and starving.
Our country is in ruins,
while we're imprisoned
thousands of miles away.
All we can do now
is watch and wait.
It's no use fighting our fate.
Far better to accept it like men
and wait for the day
when we can rise again as a nation.
Up until now,
we've lived and died together.
Now we must
share this fate together too.
If we die here in Burma,
we'll die together.
But if by chance
we're able to return home,
we'll do so together,
leaving no man behind.
We'll rebuild our country.
That's all I can say for now.
What's Mudon like?
So we're finally going
to the Mudon prison camp.
- Good thing, too!
- What's so good about it?
You think they'll kill us all?
Are you serious?
So what's Mudon like?
How should I know?
- Where's Mizushima?
- Here.
The captain's calling you.
A Japanese unit has been
holding out on a mountain.
The British have laid siege to it
for the past three days.
I've asked them
to let one of us go
and talk our men
into surrendering.
I don't want a single man
to die needlessly.
That's the mountain there.
What do you say?
Will you go?
It's a half day's trek by foot.
I'll go, sir.
I'm not sure what to do,
but I'll proceed as necessary.
Thank you.
The rest of us
will go south to Mudon.
Join us once you've completed
your mission.
It'll be tough to walk
the 200 miles to Mudon alone,
but the British
have assured you safe passage.
I'll proceed to Mudon
once I've fulfilled my duty.
Very well. Persuade them to surrender.
But you only have 30 minutes.
We won't wait any longer.
What happened?
They suddenly stopped.
Must be having
their afternoon tea.
- Son of a bitch!
- Wait! He's Japanese!
- Careful!
- How'd you get here?
- Well done!
- Where'd you come from?
Where's your commander?
I'm Mizushima from Inouye Company.
I'm here on a mission.
What? You're a messenger?
The Japanese army
has surrendered.
Furither resistance is useless.
Please surrender as quickly as -
Shut up!
How dare you!
Surrendering is an insult
to those who've died!
Unlike your unit,
we're not filthy cowards!
We'll fight to the death!
- What good are you then?
Live, endure, work
for your country!
For our country?
How dare you!
How does surrendering
help our country?
No one here wants to live
with that humiliation!
As long as nobody surrenders,
how can Japan lose?
That's right!
A coward like you
can't be Japanese.
Leave!
- I refuse!
Not until you reconsider.
You'll die if you stay.
Aren't you afraid?
I don't want to die
meaninglessly.
Dying in battle
is meaningless?
It doesn't serve Japan
or its people or yourself.
It's meaningless.
- How dare you!
- A harp? What's the big idea?
- I use it to signal.
Captain, you're responsible
for these men's lives.
If they die in vain,
the blame will be yours.
Who will apologize to their families
and to the people of Japan?
Very well.
I'll ask the men.
How's it really gonna turn out?
Just as I said.
If only we had time
to discuss it calmly.
Unforitunately, time's almost up.
Please decide
in the next three minutes!
It's unanimous:
We'll fight to the death!
I'll ask the British
to give me more time.
- You're afraid of dying!
- Coward!
- I'm not a coward!
- Should we be taken prisoner?
Go home alone!
Very well.
I don't have time
to argue with you.
What are you doing?
We'll never surrender!
My captain said not to let
a single man die needlessly!
You'll pay for this,
you son of a bitch!
MUDON
It's awful quiet.
Old lady, glad you made it!
And in the rain!
It's her livelihood.
Old lady, let's trade.
What do you have today?
That stupid Indian soldier.
Firing blanks to scare me.
A raw recruit, I'll bet.
How can he not know my face?
How about a molasses bar
for this broom?
That's a broom?
I made it out of palm leaves.
You're a clever fellow.
Okay, it's a trade.
I made
this bamboo flute yesterday.
It sounds really nice.
Trade for some bananas?
Okay, trade.
I don't want this monkey you gave me.
Can I trade it for food?
No, that's a naughty monkey.
I won't take it back.
I'll trade these new socks
for shrimp paste.
Okay, trade.
- Is that stuff good?
- Tastes like our salted fish guts.
Old lady...
did you ask about
what we discussed?
You forgot again, didn't you?
It's hopeless.
We can't get information.
We have to rely on you.
It's no use getting angry.
Please don't forget this time.
The wounded Japanese
brought to the Mudon hospital -
were they really captured
on Triangle Mountain?
And if so, was there
a man from another unit?
And is he okay?
Just ask that much.
I'm going to the hospital
in a few days for some trading.
I'll ask about it.
- We'll pay what we can.
- Don't forget.
Don't forget, please!
I understand.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
She's kind,
but completely unreliable.
I wonder what happened to him.
It's been over ten days.
I should have gone myself.
Would you all shut up?
We haven't even begun to taste
the suffering of defeat yet.
We ought to be grateful
that we're just locked up here.
What do you say?
Let's starit
our rehearsals tomorrow.
Okada, take this.
- They're singing with us.
- They come every day.
Sarge, you don't
sing so well, do you?
I'm probably
the worst in the unit.
- So you know you're bad?
- I guess.
That monk's here again.
People always give him offerings.
He rakes it in here.
Fall in!
Double file, forward!
- What is it?
- What's wrong?
- Kinda looks like Mizushima.
- Looks exactly like him!
Mizushima?
Mizushima!
Stop fooling around.
You'll scare him.
Hello, old lady!
What are you doing here?
This is my house.
So this is where you live!
Did you ask for us?
Yes, this time
I remembered to ask.
What happened to Mizushima?
Mizushima?
I mean,
what did they tell you?
Calm down and I'll tell you
everything they told me.
You know the hospital,
the soldier -
Just give us the gist.
This squall's going to pass.
They said they were
on Triangle Mountain.
There was a man
from another unit.
They were all running around,
bullets flying everywhere,
so he probably died there.
So he's dead after all.
He died in battle.
That's the same kind
that monk had.
Did you meet the monk too?
This is the brother
of the monk's bird.
My husband spent
all day yesterday in the woods
and caught five parrots.
The monk came along
and asked him for directions.
My husband gave him a parrot
to earn a favorable rebirith.
He sold three.
Only this one is left.
Old lady...
will you sell me that bird?
It's a very cute bird.
This is thanks
for all the information.
This is for you too.
Thank you.
Go ahead. Take the bird.
This bird can learn
Burmese, Japanese -
anything you want to teach it.
It's been five days already.
Can't you see
that whatever you do is futile?
The armies of Britain and Japan
can come and fight all they wish.
Burma is still Burma.
Burma is the Buddha's country.
I'm starving.
- Which way is Mudon?
- I don't know.
- Which way is south?
- That way.
