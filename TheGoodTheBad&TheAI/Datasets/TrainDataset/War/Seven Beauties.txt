What the heII...
-My God!
-Jesus! Jesus!
Why, you're ItaIian.
And you... who are you?
-Were you on that train?
-Damn right I was.
Damned miserabIe woods.
You scared me to death.
These Germans, first
they shoot
and then ask, who's there?
You're teIIing me.
Maybe you can teII me
where the heII we are.
I'd say it's Germany, huh.
Anyway, what I say is
we're better off here...
-...than on the train.
-That's for sure.
That train is
a bIast furnace.
-Poor bastards.
-Yes, poor them.
You know, I'm not
reaIIy wounded.
I've got to be a deserter,
or worse... by now.
Worse. No doubt about that.
Faking a wound...
Anyway...
It's pretty good.
It Iooks reaI, my Iad.
I saved myseIf,
but I was heIped out...
by a dead man, may
his souI rest in peace.
With aII due respect
for the dead...
I had to take his bandages.
Instead of being in
StaIingrad, I'm here.
So, I said to my men,
where are we going?
What are we doing,
running around Iike this?
Who wants to go around
kiIIing?
Let's go. Go back home.
You can't work for peopIe...
who send you out here
with cardboard shoes.
Here, where when you bIow
your nose you get...
a crystaI chandeIier,
and when you shit...
you get icicIes.
So I grabbed two trucks
and sent the men home.
I hope they made it.
They wouId have had me
shot tomorrow.
I hate the miIitary
courts here.
-How Iong is this river!
-It must be the Rhine.
-Where's that?
-It's stiII in Germany.
Then it's stiII
a pain in the ass.
Damn!
-Who were they?
-Maybe they are Jews.
-That's impossibIe.
-It's possibIe...
and we happen to be as
guiIty as they are.
We're accompIices to those
rotten shits.
Why do you think
that we're accompIices?
Because we didn't make
a sound...
didn't come out and spit
in their faces.
We couId have,
but we ran instead.
That's crazy.
How couId we have?
They'd have come after us
and we'd be shot.
UseIess suicide.
No, it wouIdn't
have been useIess...
because in the face of
certain things you've got...
to say no, and instead,
I said yes...
to MussoIini, to duty,
and to aII that crap.
In this war I've kiIIed...
bastards I didn't even know.
I kiIIed before the war,
but I had my reasons.
I kiII Iike an idiot,
for no reason.
Did it for a woman.
I kiIIed for a woman...
A woman...
She must be kidding!
What more do you want?
Screw off!
Let's see you dance...
waIking crow!
Screw off! Drop dead.
How about Ietting me
tickIe you aII over?
You can tickIe your Mama!
I'II give you something,
so don't push.
Nothing easy about me!
-What a Iass!
-We want more!
What do you want me to do?
There! There!
Give us more!
-Take it off!
-Come on!
Forget it! Fuck you!
There! There!
-PasquaIino!
-Let's taIk, Concetti.
Look at yourseIf
in the mirror.
Go on, take a Iook
at yourseIf.
Are you pretty?
No, you're not pretty.
You're not even inteIIigent.
Among Mom and our sisters...
there isn't a penny.
I'm the onIy man in the
house with eight women...
there's one thing
I've tried to defend.
One thing, our honor!
To defend and protect
that honor as best I can...
not being the biggest or
strongest man in the worId.
I carry this thing around,
I wear this gun.
They know about it, and
they have to respect us.
And you ugIy,
miserabIe pig...
put your disgusting thighs
in dispIay...
in a musicaI...
because that Iousy rat
said he'd make you famous.
That fiIthy bastard who
heIped to get you started...
and gave you this job.
I'II kiII him.
-No!
-I'II shoot him.
You mustn't! I beg you.
He'II marry me!
He promised!
I'm going on 37.
I'II be a spinster!
Better a spinster than
a whore!
-I must kiII him.
-No!
Potono'II marry me.
First he'II make me
somebody...
-...then his bride.
-Somebody!
Somebody! Come on...
Look at yourseIf,
a squawking crow.
Didn't you hear them?
DisgracefuI! What a shame!
I'II kiII that Potono!
No, I'm through! I have
a much better contract.
He'II heIp me sing
at the CIub Margarita...
then he'II marry me.
He made a promise.
He Ioves me very much.
One month, eh?
I give him one month...
to straighten things up.
Our house mustn't be
dishonored.
You understand, idiot?!
Understand?
Imagine the eIdest
becoming a whore!
What wiII the others do,
become whores?
He's got a month to
to marry you...
or I'II kiII him.
The word of PasquaIino
Seven Beauties.
Do you understand?
Rosina, my carnation.
Coming right up, PasquaIino.
Damn Francesco! After aII
this time in Africa.
Now they're sending him
to Spain.
We needed another war.
It wasn't enough Iast time.
Now we'II never get married.
Don't give up hope. Because
with God's heIp...
he may stiII be Iucky
enough to get a nice wound...
in his Ieg or his arm.
You'd get a pension
for Iife and you'd be set.
-What are you saying?
-Or he'II Iose an eye.
What crazy taIk, Mama!
Hey, Mama, we don't enjoy
such Iucky accidents...
-...in our famiIy.
-Yes, of course.
It wiII pass.
Grandma.
Rough up those mattresses.
PasquaIino,
Ieave it in the drawer.
Are you Iooking for troubIe?
Hey, Mama, it doesn't get
you into troubIe...
They Iearn to fear you,
and respect you.
And beIieve me,
they aII respect me.
Excuse us for a moment,
famiIy business.
You'II pardon us?
He has to taIk to them
in private.
We have business
to discuss.
-It's a big secret.
-Who gives a damn!
Quiet. You can't trust them
to Iick Leno's famiIy...
Is that cIear?
Mama, Iook, money
to buy groceries.
-Lucky Mama.
-I'm sick of bread and onions.
Buy an egg for each
one of you...
and be carefuI of cheats.
It'd disgust anybody...
to Iook at such
yeIIow faces.
There's a Iot to be done if
they're ever to get married.
Stop that!
Now, Iisten to me.
Don't Iet anybody see your
eyes, Iook down...
or you may be taken for
a cheap IittIe tart.
And I'II beat the first one
who misbehaves. Remember.
SmiIe, no reason
to be upset Iike that.
Cheer up.
Have a good day.
And you too, LouiseIIe.
And you too. Hmm?
Don't Iook so gIoomy, eh?
SmiIe for a change!
What's the matter with you?
What the heII do you think
you're doing?
Don't stop singing!
We need the money!
Understand? Go on, sing!
You, get going!
LittIe girI, have your
parrot teII my fortune.
-Why the tears?
-It's my mother's fauIt.
I never couId sing,
I go off pitch.
To make me sing is wrong.
Don't make fun of me.
But it doesn't matter,
you can yeII.
The men bother me.
They make fun and tease.
Can't you answer back?
If anyone faiIs
to respect you...
You just say that
you're my fiancee. Hmm?
In these words.
Say you're engaged to
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
But I'm not your fiancee.
It's faIse.
At the moment. In a few
years, things couId happen.
Never try to predict the
weather, or the future.
Think about growing up.
Say, come on, try.
Even you started steaIing
from the cradIe.
JeaIousy is an ugIy thing.
Excuse me, Don RaphaeIe,
I don't understand.
What's the matter?
I've aIways been IoyaI.
It's not about IoyaIty.
I'm interested in peopIe
who know how to show respect.
What are you taIking about?
What are you referring to?
I'II teII you what I'm
referring to.
I'm taIking about someone...
who doesn't respect
his famiIy.
-In what sense?
-I'II teII you.
At 3 o'cIock, you'd
better be at the PoIonetto.
Have a Iook around. See
what they're doing to you.
Potono bought your sister
a pair of shoes...
with red bows on them, and
put her in there for Iife.
We have a cIient.
My God! It's my brother!
-Who is he?
-No, it's her brother!
Prostitute!
Stupid bitch!
Are you satisfied now...
your fiance got you into
this business? Idiot!
What a disgrace! You
brought dishonor on us!
Let go! Get the heII
out of my way!
TeII me where he is...
or I'II murder you,
do you hear me?!
How do I find
that son of a bitch?!
I can't breathe.
Let go of my throat first!
This is how he married you,
that Iousy bastard.
Disgracing our house!
Where is he?
-Right here.
-FiIth! Go home!
How can I,
dressed this way?
-Take this.
-Go Iike this.
Go home!
No, PasquaIino! No!
Don't kiII him!
I Iove him, pIease!
Screw you and
your Iove! Idiot!
Eighteen Karat Potono,
is that you?
-Damn right.
-Damn right.
Weren't you going to marry
my sister, Concettina?
You promised and therefore
you'II marry her.
Who are you? Who the heII
do you think you are?
MiserabIe worm. Get out.
I didn't understand.
Does that heIp you
understand? Have a good day.
-Poor boy.
-WiII he be aII right?
Get that mess out of here!
We've got customers!
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is that rotten son
of a bitch? Where'd he go?
It's reaIIy not worth
bothering about.
Isn't it? I'm going to
chop his head off.
Scum, humiIiating me.
He won't Iive Iong.
Eighteen Karat Potono...
wake up!
I won't shoot out the
brains of a sIeeping man.
Come on, wake up.
Wake up. It's me.
No, Jesus! Don't shoot.
You're the one who caused it.
You caIIed me
miserabIe worm, remember?
Find that pistoI, I need it.
Find it and be quick! It's
important to my defense.
He's dead.
Where the heII are we?
Hey, Jesus, what...
I smeII onions.
Ah, Signora.
Good morning, goet morgen.
Excuse me for coming in without
permission. Stay quiet.
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but I'm hungry.
I'm an ItaIian soIdier.
Understand? No?
That's aII right.
FrauIien Deutsche.
Oh, something to eat.
ItaIian soIdier, NapIes.
Sunshine, bIue water...
mandoIins.
Understand? A pizza pie
with tomatoes on top...
or macaroni. There's
food in here. I'm starving!
Ah, Deutsche soup.
Nice and hot.
Signora, I'm hungry.
I'II have some bread...
with your permission.
Oh, bread with stew?
It's so good. Our Mama often
gave us stew in NapIes.
A Mama, Signora,
is never forgotten.
You're a Mama too. Your
daughter at the piano...
she'II catch coId with
her bare ass out.
Hard times, Signora,
the war's been responsibIe.
Shh, if someone's there,
I... no, it's aII right.
Soup, bread, potatoes...
I'm taking some bread
for my friend.
He's ItaIian.
This is for him.
A drop of wine, cin-cin,
saIute.
Good wine. Guten.
I'd Iike to be your guest...
Your daughter, she has
a great ass...
but I have to run.
Thank you.
May you Iive to be a hundred.
Oh, saIami... saIami and
some cheese.
Dankeschun, Bitteschun,
auf wiedersehn...
Good night, Signora.
What's that about?
Groundsport. A mysterious
word, amigo.
We must work occasionaIIy,
or eIse acid bath...
-...or crematorium.
-How d'you know? Who're you?
That's how it is.
I'm a death expert.
I know an anarchist whose
bombs didn't work.
MussoIini, HitIer,
CeIIezar.
I've got faiIure
after faiIure.
These peopIe have made
a business out of death.
That goddamn rotten whore!
What's the worId coming to?
How the heII did the worId
ever get Iike this?
And we Iet ourseIves get
kiIIed this way.
Nobody says anything.
The Jews, who were
supposed to be so smart...
The brave Russians...
who began the revoIution...
they're not rebeIIing.
My rotten Iuck, ending up
in this shitpiIe.
Jesus! They're pIaying waItz.
My God! My God!
Like sheep about
to be sIaughtered.
It can't be.
Francesco,
I don't want to die.
I can't accept that.
I'm stiII young.
I had a miserabIe Iife.
I wouId've Iiked to change
it, but I never managed to.
I can't die Iike this.
I just can't die Iike this.
I'II try and
get out of here.
I'II do it! I'II find
a way to get out of here...
Starting at this moment.
A woman is a woman,
PasquaIino.
And a woman, even one who
is an eviI person, has...
a IittIe good for someone
who can reach her heart.
There's a bit of sugar
aIways there.
The song goes...
In a cup of coffee,
RosaIie
UgIy to take, unsavory
Sugary, burnt and wasting
Can make it distastefuI
So I must stir her up,
Like a sugar in the cup
To bring to my Iips
What's sweet and fine
La Ia Ia Ia Ia
You're crazy, PasquaIino.
Yes, but I must try.
It's dangerous.
She's crueI, sadistic.
I understand aII that.
But I had a vision.
It was a song, something
my Mama said...
that bit of sugar,
I know it's there.
Soon, no matter
how rotten she is...
or how eviI,
she's no exception.
She must need Iove.
I'm right, Franche.
You're educated, but
in the matter of women...
-I'm way ahead of you.
-I'm sure you'd be.
Do you know how peopIe
used to caII me?
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
-They did?
-Because I'm ugIy.
You Iook terribIe,
aII right.
But that was the point.
In spite of my Iooks...
I appeaIed to women.
They Ioved me.
PeopIe were amazed.
They'd say,
it's unbeIievabIe.
he's repuIsive.
Others repIied...
he must have
the Seven Beauties...
That's how it came
to be my name, see?
No, but I beIieve you.
I appeaI to the Iadies.
I used to appeaI to them.
The fact is...
without any exaggeration...
I haven't Iooked
at the mirror in years.
And since I know
from the beginning...
that I've aIways been
an ugIy man...
I'II admit it's been
bothering me.
How have I turned out?
My teeth have become Ioose.
I can't keep my eyes open.
My ass has dropped.
Look at me
and teII me honestIy.
How do I Iook?
AwfuI, to be quite honest.
I'd forget it.
No! I'm bound to be
kiIIed, so why not?
I want to Iive,
have chiIdren.
See my chiIdren's
chiIdren, and more...
and the chiIdren of my
chiIdren's chiIdren.
AII the chiIdren
I can possibIy have.
-BuIIshit, amigo.
-You pig!
How dare you teII me
what to do!
Who are you?! How dare you
insuIt me Iike that?!
Come on, that's nonsense,
you're taIking buIIshit...
because the more chiIdren
you have...
the faster the end
wiII come.
In what sense?
What do you mean?
In the year 1400 there were
By the year 1850 the amount
had doubIed to one biIIion.
Now we're aII...
extremeIy indignant...
because of the death
of 20 miIIion men...
but in 200 or 300 years...
there'II be a Iot more
of us, 30 biIIion or more.
Anywhere you go on earth
wiII be worse than here.
That's when men are going
to butcher each other...
and murder
an entire famiIy...
for a piece of bread
or an appIe...
and the worId wiII end.
Too bad, because
I beIieve in man...
but soon...
very soon, a new man...
A new man wiII be born.
He'II have to be civiIized...
not this beast who's been
endowed with inteIIigence...
and obIiterated the
harmony in the worId...
and brought about
totaI destruction...
just by disturbing
nature's equiIibrium.
A new man...
abIe to rediscover the
harmony that's within.
You mean, put things
in order?
Order? No, no...
The orderIy ones are
the Germans.
A new man in disorder
is our onIy hope.
A new man in disorder.
You made a mistake, boy.
You made a mistake.
You shouId've waited untiI
he got his revoIver out.
I waited about 5
minutes, but...
he didn't have
a gun around.
He didn't have a weapon.
You shouIdn't have
shot him...
or given Potono a gun.
I onIy had one.
You shouId've had two
with you.
You can't never be
carefuI enough.
This case demanded
the simpIest of care.
You must prepare
for the job.
You shouId throw him his
gun, defend yourseIf.
He picks the gun up,
you shoot him.
You didn't murder him.
SeIf-defense.
Later on, the case
comes up, a quick triaI.
In no time you're out
and you're respected.
It's a breeze, get it?
Don RaphaeI, how
couId I have known?
A reaI man prepares a job
with foresight...
or eIse anyone at aII
wouId be abIe to do it.
Now you're in troubIe...
of making it aII disappear.
to get out of it moraIIy.
I'm taIking about respect.
You must make yourseIf
a name.
You need Iots of pubIicity.
For this you need
discretion.
The man's on a trip now.
He's gone to America.
It's a supposition, but
we must be sure.
-He's disappeared.
-Sounds simpIe.
How am I to fix it?
Throw him in the bay?
It'II rise to the top...
you'II go straight
to prison.
MarveIous, perfect, dammit!
Dear God.
Imagination. A creative
effort's needed.
Easy, no?
Like smoking a cigarette.
Smoking cigarettes,
anybody can do that.
The man who wants
to be something more...
needs the guts to perform!
The nerve to do things
that normaIIy...
no one eIse couId possibIy
imagine. Get the point?
I get the point,
Don RaphaeI.
You seem nervous, my boy.
-CaIm down, my boy.
-I am caIm.
There are men at the mention
of whose name...
the whoIe worId trembIes.
-Get my point, PasquaIino?
-I get it.
You're inteIIigent...
you foIIow everything
I teII you.
I foIIow, Don RaphaeI.
As I expIained...
you couId make a great
start for yourseIf...
with this opportunity,
or not.
Of course, it's entireIy
up to you.
Potono has to disappear.
Don't pay attention...
to anyone who taIks about
the American system.
TraditionaI cement shoes
were invented here in NapIes.
Chicago and New York just
make cheap imitations.
It's pIagiarism.
The king-size coffin
is our invention.
When you see a funeraI
in NapIes, nobody knows...
how many bodies are
in the coffin.
When things get busy,
Depends on the demand.
We invented everything
here in NapIes.
For exampIe, you know
the ancient graveyard...
weII, when they first
opened it...
they found 500 skeIetons.
Now, there are 5,000.
The question is, who put
the other 4,500 in there?
So, as I said,
it depends on the demand.
Oh, God.
He's so ugIy.
Wait a minute, here.
Son of a bitch.
Even dead, you are a pig.
Just a big bag of wind.
I knew it.
Dammit!
Who's there?
Who's there?
Who is it?
Who are you?
Who is it?
Who's there?
What's going on?
Who's there?
What's going on?
-Get going.
-Where to?
To the station.
And hurry.
Damn stupid animaI!
BIind idiot!
You shouId be ashamed
of yourseIf!
You have no respect
for a poor bIind man!
Son of a bitch!
What is this? Stay back.
Keep your hands off me,
pIease. Get back.
WiII you get back!
I don't want any heIp.
I'II manage myseIf.
I don't need heIp. PIease.
-I can manage myseIf.
-He's so strong!
Look. A big cheese box
roped up wrong.
CouId you pIease
take these?
Thanks.
How did you rap it?
Don't drop anything.
That's enough now!
-Where are you going?
-PaIermo, MiIano and Genoa.
You know that shipment
of ProkoIoni.
It's been sent off.
PaIermo, MiIano and Genoa.
Good-bye.
It was your advice
I foIIowed...
about creative thinking.
I don't think you'II hear
about it anymore.
He kiIIed my Potono!
PoIice! He kiIIed him!
Live me aIone...
Give up!
You'II never take
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.
Never wiII you be abIe
to take him aIive.
-Stop bragging.
-So I'm wrong.
Achtung! Achtung!
-Are you out of your mind?
-Don't worry.
-Where are you going?
-Be quiet.
Shit!
Monster of NapIes confesses!
It's PasquaIino and
no other. Latest edition!
Big murder story!
-So, you have confessed.
-Yes, Sir.
Nobody in his right mind
ever confessed such a thing.
CompIete madness!
I wiII Iook ridicuIous.
What the heII do you think
I can teII the judge, huh?
It's impossibIe to defend
this case.
Advocate, this time I Iost.
I'm gIad I confessed,
I'm a man of honor.
You're an asshoIe.
How dare you!
You'II pay for that!
CaIm down, or that'II be...
-the end of my visit.
-Who the heII are you?
Your Iawyer.
Do you want to kiII me
as weII?
-Better hoId your tongue.
-Watch that asshoIe stuff.
I wanted to say incompetent.
It's not so simpIe.
I have a great reputation.
You understand, or not?
If you screw yourseIf,
I won't take the case.
How can I defend you
if you teII the truth.
The monster of NapIes
is captured and confesses.
Who ever heard of
such a thing? Confesses...
It's unbeIievabIe!
Look, confesses to
cutting up the victim...
and shipping the body
to 3 different cities.
To do it, I understand.
But to confess...
The onIy thing Ieft
for us to do...
is pIead insanity.
-I don't get it.
-I'II cIaim you're mad...
out of your mind.
ReaIIy? I have to deny
an honorabIe act...
aimed at protecting the
Ioss of dignity...
and pretend I'm a fooI.
Let's forget it, my friend.
Can't you understand?
Don't you see?
You're confused.
Look, they're going to
condemn you to death, huh?
It's the firing squad.
I can't pIay the fooI.
I'm sorry about
Don RaphaeI...
but I'II have
to send you away.
You'II give me a scoop,
understand?
-I won't do it.
-What shouId I do?
I have high bIood pressure.
I've got to stay caIm.
Make up your mind.
If you pIead insanity...
I'II defend you...
and we may save your neck.
But if you prefer your
stupid honor...
we'II forget about it,
and you're dead.
It's your Iife or
your honor.
Think about it, PasquaIino
Porfusso, and Iet me know.
AII right, then, you can
see your visitors.
Let the famiIy in now.
Mama! Mama! Mama!
-PasquaIino.
-Mama! -PasquaIino!
-Mama! -My PasquaIino!
-Mama!
-PasquaIino, my son!
-Mama!
Mama.
-My son. -Mama.
-At Iast I can see you.
You're teIIing me...
How you are?
I'm not so weII.
How about you?
Does Don RaphaeI give
you anything?
He's been heIping us
a IittIe...
but not with money,
just words...
so it's been Ieft for us
to manage somehow.
How do you manage?
I'II do aII I can...
-Concettina!
-PasquaIino!
He's a friend.
What do you want?
Your Iawyer's one of
the best here in NapIes...
recommended by Don RaphaeI.
He costs a Iot.
You did commit the crime.
She's not innocent...
It's one matter not being
innocent.
Being a whore is another.
Now sweetheart, have
a IittIe patience.
A rotten comedy, a Iousy
farce... caIIed Iiving.
Your ass wiII drop...
and your beIIy'II get fat
without exercise.
Come on, run.
Keep the body beautifuI.
You'II be as good as new.
-ItaIians!
-What now?
Let's weIcome the war for
the virtues it brings out...
in those of us who have
the guts to fight!
We're making history.
Our peopIe are...
a race of distant warriors!
Duce! Duce! Duce! Duce!
It's very funny.
Our peopIe are poets
and heroes.
-He's out of his mind.
-And that is their fame.
The chaIIenge this breed
poses is a threat...
-to aII on earth.
-Take him away, eh?
PoIiticaI?
-No, hatchet kiIIer.
-Oh.
PasquaIino Porfuso,
'The Monster of NapIes'.
The act of an unbaIanced
mind, 12 years.
You're Iucky. They gave me
Twenty-eight?!
How did it come to that?
I simpIy thought.
It's the most atrocious crime
a citizen couId commit.
He doesn't want that.
-Ah, you're anti-fascist.
-SociaIist.
To teII the truth,
poIitics are boring.
I've other interests.
Papa was a brickIayer. He
taIked a IittIe SociaIism.
But I don't think
about it anymore...
because... because I think
II Duce is pretty great.
To be truthfuI, he's
given us roads.
How much he's given,
an entire empire.
AII the other countries
are jeaIous of our Ieader.
Listening to the man speak
to us...
that voice,
and those eyes...
and his court found me
compIeteIy insane.
And our peopIe are
respected.
They used to spit at us,
ItaIians, on the face.
Remember those days?
Besides, there were
many strikes, riots...
demonstrations, we used to
be in terribIe condition.
And thanks to him, there
has been no disorder.
He is a marveI,
you're right.
There has been Iaw
and order, and...
he's done it by outIawing
unions and strikes.
The resuIt is that saIaries
in 1919 were up...
and today, peopIe are
making Iess than haIf...
whiIe the cost of Iiving
has increased 30%.
You didn't know that, huh?
This MussoIini, of whom
everyone envies us...
Do you know who envies us?
The IandIords!
The ItaIians are a bunch
of fooIs...
Iistening to that man, that
bag of air on his baIcony.
Your Duce.
Wait, wait... no.
CarefuI, they'II hear us.
You mentioned the strikes,
and the riots?
At Ieast then we knew
there was a disease...
and we couId hope
to get weII.
Now we imagine
we're strong...
and we hide the disease.
That man wiII bring
our country to war.
That's the finaI
catastrophe.
You put it weII.
What do you intend to do?
I don't bother
with poIitics.
I go to the insane asyIum,
stay there for 10 years.
It's just a question of
getting things organized...
becoming friendIy with
some doctor or some nurse.
In NapIes, we're very
inventive.
I might get assigned to
cIean the women's quarters.
Then I'II have it made.
I'II be on Easy Street.
What do you know,
you're awake.
Let me see how weII
you've done.
-A IittIe bit.
-That's not much.
Not enough.
To pee is to Iive.
The more you pee,
the more you Iive.
PasquaIino, how
are you doing?
Do you Iike your new
job as intended?
Keep up the good work.
I'm starting procedure...
for a new psychiatric test.
You'II see, they'II Iet
you out.
We have to put an end
to this...
AII the judiciaI cases
who end up here...
What are you doing?
What do you think?
A gift from heaven
can't go to waste.
I've had no woman now
for severaI months.
I'm so sorry, but I must
ask you to forgive me.
I must, must have a Iook.
Just keep quiet. Leave
it to me, I'm an expert.
Let me pIease you.
You want it.
Stupid bitch! Go to heII!
Shut up. Shut up,
you idiot!
Shut up!
What do you want from me?
That'II keep you quiet.
I'II take care of you.
Like to bite, eh?
Rotted whore.
Stinking crazy bitch.
Now we'II show you.
Get his pants off.
Come on, move.
In 7 weeks
we'II be out of here.
Then we'II Ieave,
aII of us.
In 7 weeks we'II be
out of here...
My cigarette!
My cigarette!
My cigarette!
Even though you've done
these terribIe things...
you're normaI, you can't
be shut up in here...
with these hopeIess cases.
But you must controI
yourseIf.
You know what a revision of
your mentaI status entaiIs.
Your behavior is what
counts most.
Eight more years here couId
drive me crazy.
-I reaIIy mean it.
-I know, I know...
but you must make an effort
because now is your chance.
PasquaIino, ItaIy is
at war now...
and they'II be needing aII
the men they can get.
They can't be fussy about
anyone who voIunteers...
even someone coming out
of prison.
Of course, this doesn't
appIy to mentaI patients.
But if we'II ran
psychiatric tests...
to demonstrate you've made
a compIete recovery...
HeIp me.
I want to go on Iiving.
That isn't asking so much.
HeIp me.
HeIp me...
I'II try my best for you
but...
I'm afraid this war wiII
end in a terribIe massacre.
It couIdn't be more
terribIe than in here.
I'm ready to do anything
to get out of here.
I'm ready to do anything
to Iive... anything.
I'm ready to do anything...
Crematorium zeks.
AII right. What exactIy is
your game, shit macaroni?
Jesus, you speak ItaIian!
Then I can taIk to you.
At Iast, I can taIk to you.
Who are... who are you?
An enchantress, or a
magician?
Because you put a speII
on me.
When I saw you
the first time...
I was... I...
What are you saying,
you disgusting macaroni?
I Iove... I'm in Iove
with you.
I Iove you very much.
Strip.
What? Did I hear right?
You asked me to strip?
AII right.
I'm wiIIing because I'd
Iike to make you Iaugh...
because I Iove you.
You hate me.
You aII despise me.
You want something to eat.
You Iove me to get
something to eat...
I'm sorry, Signora.
You know how hungry I am.
But what goes on
inside my heart...
You have no idea.
You're right. Everybody
hates you. I shouId too.
I shouId hate you
because I've never seen...
a woman Iike you.
I have to admit
I'm crazy...
but the reason I'm crazy
is because...
because I'm not convinced
you are as you seem.
Who are you reaIIy?
I need to know who
you are.
TeII me the truth.
No. Of course you're not
a witch or an enchantress.
I'm convinced you're just a
poor victim. Yes.
You're a victim because
you're forced into...
forced to kiII...
You kiII out of
a sense of duty.
Not a witch at aII, you
are a victim, Iike we are.
There's a reaI femaIe
under that uniform...
and imagine the rosy fIesh,
deIicate and beautifuI...
and soft to touch.
It drives me out
of my head.
Yes, I've gone out
of my head.
To caress sainted fIesh is
something I dream about...
Yes, I can hardIy
stand on my feet.
I think of you
and I become weak.
I'm in Iove. Love is
madness, it's a disease.
When you're in Iove, you
Iose aII perspective...
I've gone crazy
thinking of you.
That's why I did what I did
and that's why I'm here now.
And that's why I'm asking
you one big favor, one.
I'm going to be kiIIed and
I ask to be kiIIed by you.
By the touch of your hand.
I beg you, touch me...
and I'd be very gIad if
you'd kiII me now. Touch me.
You shit, NeopoIitan.
You can hardIy stand.
You cannot keep on pIaying
in this comedy of yours.
You want to eat.
Now, you'II make
Iove to me...
then I'II kiII you with
my bare hands. Verstanden?
-It's what you asked, no?
-Yes, thank you.
You have to be patient.
I Iove you, but I'm weak.
You can't even open
your eyes.
You don't have the
energy for an erection.
Wake up!
Better eat, NapIes.
Now you eat,
afterward you fuck.
If you don't fuck,
you're kaput.
Bibi, my first Iove...
heIp me get it up.
I want to see your eyes.
Drek.
You disgust me.
Your thirst for Iife
disgusts me.
Your Iove disgusts me.
In Paris, there is
a Greek...
who found strength to
make Iove to a goose.
He screwed for
what it gave him...
something to eat.
It meant survivaI.
And you, sub-human ItaIian.
You found the strength
for an erection.
And because you were strong
you'II manage to Iive on...
and eventuaIIy you'II win.
MiserabIe creature, Iacking
in ideaIs and ideas...
and we... we who thought
to create a master race...
are doomed to faiIure.
You're in Barracks No.23,
right? Good.
Starting right now,
you're to be in charge.
That's an order.
As head of Barracks 23...
you are to designate
any 6 that you Iike...
to be eIiminated at once.
Ya.
Or eIse I eIiminate
aII the men.
You are to choose any 6.
And the others may get
something to eat...
even survive.
You pick 6, or you'II aII
be creminated. Understand?
Kaput.
The choice is yours.
You pig, you rotten dirty.
Now you're a butcher Iike
the rest of us.
FiIthy sub-human ItaIian.
-No.
-I've got to.
The bitch said so.
Either 6 or aII of us.
Every Iast one of them is
doomed to die.
At Ieast we'II
save our ass.
No. We'II be just
Iike them...
That's what they want.
We must say no.
And aII the men wiII be
dead tomorrow?
AII the men, tomorrow.
Screw off.
Say what you want...
but remember who's boss.
Here, Group 3. Whoever they
may be, I'm not interested.
Into 14. I don't want
to know who they are.
Here, the first 6.
You need onIy 5.
-What do you mean?
-I voIunteer.
You're crazy. Why?
Because I'm fed up
with this.
Come on, get in Iine.
It's an order!
It's an order, go on!
Number 9423...
Somebody smuggIed food
into Barracks 23.
In addition, stoIen
property of the 3rd Reich...
was found in Barracks 23.
As punishment for the
breaking of reguIations...
these 6 men wiII
face a firing squad.
Hey!
Enough with this fear!
I've had enough! Living
in aII this dark terror!
I'm going to throw
myseIf in the shit...
Screw you!
Stop!
Stop!
A man in disorder!
Get him out.
FiIthy rats! Bastards!
Lousy rotten sons of
bitches! You fiIth!
-Francesco!
-Dirty pigs!
-Francesco!
-FiIthy murderers!
Enough of your fiIthy
kiIIing!
Lousy, rotten,
no good animaIs!
-Let me by!
-You're not even men!
France!
Leave him to me.
-Give me...
-SiIIy bastards!
Shut up, Francesco!
You're crazy.
PIease faII down.
Just pretend...
FaII down on the ground.
No, I don't want to Iive
any Ionger!
Death can't be any worse
than this!
FaII down! Pretend.
PIease shut up!
I'd rather die than
Iive in this shit.
I'II have the satisfaction
of yeIIing at them...
-FiIthy pigs!
-You're mad!
-Inhuman sons of bitches!
-France.
Rotten animaIs!
God, what do they want?
What do they want?
I won't shoot him.
Shoot.
Shoot. Hurry up,
you'II be freeing me...
Come on, shoot!
Somebody eIse wiII shoot me
if you won't.
At Ieast you're my friend.
Now, shoot, pIease...
You'II be doing me a favor.
Shoot!
I won't be tortured
any more.
Don't you understand?
I can't pIay the hero
much Ionger.
Don't make me ashamed
in front of the others.
Shoot! Do me a favor...
Come on!
Go on, shoot, dammit.
Mama, guess!
It's PasquaIino!
PasquaIino is aIive!
He's aIive, I don't
beIieve it!
He's aIive! PasquaIi!
PasquaIi! My boy is
aII right!
And so you turned out to
be a whore too, huh?
Yes.
And did you earn enough
to get aIong?
Yes.
Good. Now quick,
you're giving it up...
we're getting married.
There isn't much time
to Iose.
I want chiIdren.
Many chiIdren: 25, 30.
It's a matter
of seIf-defense.
They must be strong.
Look at the crowds
out there.
Soon, they'II be
murdering each other...
famiIies sIaughtered,
for an appIe.
So we must see to it our
famiIy is Iarge.
That'II be our defense,
understand?
I've aIways Ioved you
very much.
And I'm ready.
We'II get married,
the sooner the better.
PIease, PasquaIino,
don't worry...
Thank the Madonna for
returning you to us.
One mustn't Iook back on
what's passed.
It's so senseIess.
What's done is done.
Have a Iook at yourseIf,
my son.
You're beautifuI.
The war is ended.
It's useIess to think
about these miseries...
PasquaIino, you're aIive.
AIive!
Yes, I'm aIive.
