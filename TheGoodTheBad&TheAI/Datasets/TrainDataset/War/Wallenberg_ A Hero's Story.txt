NARRATOR:
RAOUL: Come on, let's give
the old witch one last dance.
Come on, kick.
Kick higher.
JACOB:
Raoul is a bit old for it, isn't he?
Why?
If I didn't mind grass stains
on my shoes,
I'd be out there dancing with them
instead of sitting here
being old with you.
Notice, Herr von Fremd,
my dear cousin's spirited defense
of her baby.
Well, it's a mother's right.
MAJ:
Raoul, be careful!
In Germany, we celebrate the family.
Isn't it so, Mr. Lauer? Ha-ha-ha.
ALL:
One, two...
- Well, throw it.
ALL: Three!
SOLDIER:
Come on, get going.
Get the hell out.
Nice Hungarian peasant boys.
Sixteen, maybe 17.
Arrow Cross fascists
jerk them off their farms,
teach them to burn, to kill.
What you say your name was?
Fodor. You know, it's Nikki Fodor.
Well, not anymore.
You're Laszlo Birosh,
Catholic, factory worker.
You know
the Jewish Music Society?
Well, go there. Get everyone out,
back to their homes.
Those choir boys will burn anything
with a Jewish sign on it tonight.
MAN: Major Wisleceny,
Colonel Eichmann.
Admiral Horthy is expecting you.
Father, look. Is that Eichmann?
- Yes, I invited him.
- You invited him?
Yes, I thought it would be politic.
Go on, ride on, Nikki.
Ah. It's good blood. Magnificent.
How many centuries of noble blood
does the old fossil claim?
EICHMANN: I was taking about
the horses, not the old fossil.
Occasionally, a piece of horse flesh
arouses me more than women's flesh,
but only occasionally.
I don't think Admiral Horthy
will let you meddle with his stable.
His country,
he can't do anything about,
but his stable and the region
of Hungary, he will fight for.
Colonel Eichmann,
how very pleasant you could come.
EICHMANN:  Hitler, Highness.
- Yes.
- Major Wisleceny.
WISLECENY:  Hitler, Highness.
You both know Monsignor Rotha,
papal nuncio.
GABOR:
Colonel Eichmann.
Colonel Eichmann,
what a happy surprise.
Lisl, this is remarkable
Colonel Eichmann
that you've wanted to meet
for so long.
Colonel, my lovely bride.
How truly fortunate you are, baron.
And how truly unfearsome
you seem, Colonel Eichmann.
Not at all what one might expect.
Really?
I am flattered.
Fearsome? Where could you
have heard such a thing?
Baron, why don't you
invite the colonel
to your Arrow Cross maneuvers
next week?
I'm sure his presence there
will encourage your young scamps.
Admiral regent,
I must see those excellent Lipizzaners
at close range.
- Delighted.
- Baroness.
- You obviously fancy horses.
LISL: Thank you.
I am certain the colonel welcomes
this opportunity
to discuss the upcoming
rites of purification privately.
Rites of purification?
Oh. Oh, yes.
That is appropriate
on Walpurgis Night, isn't it?
You know, of course,
Walpurgis Night is of German origin.
An ancient pagan custom
from Bavaria.
Can you imagine, in the old days,
people actually put some poor woman
to the torch?
I thing I prefer one made of straw.
Herr von Fremd.
I'm told you Germans
are still disposed
to such amusements.
A national appetite for bonfires, huh?
- True?
JACOB: Raoul.
- Herr von Fremd is our guest.
- Of course.
And an important client
of the Wallenberg banks.
JACOB:
That's enough, Raoul.
I apologize
for my young cousin's rudeness.
I only spoke the truth.
Herr von Fremd,
please forgive my son.
I think he has had
a bit too much to drink.
RAOUL:
Not at all, Mother.
I'm as sober as Adolf Hitler.
Now, there's a leader to be admired.
No alcohol, no tobacco.
But perhaps a taste
for more exotic vices.
JACOB:
That's enough, I said, Raoul.
I will expect a written apology
to Herr von Fremd.
- You may leave.
- Leave?
My dear Mr. Wallenberg,
that won't be necessary.
Many people listen
to this false propaganda
of unreliable sources.
I can assure you,
we have not inconvenienced
one single Jew.
And you have amply supplied them
with gas.
Oh, for cooking and heating,
of course.
RAOUL :
Your Führer will not tolerate people
...making jokes about garbage.
I teach you a lesson, a big lesson.
If you laugh at  garbage,
I give you big
the whip,
the gas,
the fire!
Out. Out. Everybody out. Go home.
TIBOR:
You there, mind your manners.
You can't break in here like this.
It's a concert.
They're burning the synagogue.
They'll be here next.
The warder sent me. Go home.
The warder? But who...?
Who burnt the synagogue?
Arrow Cross.
What are you all sitting here for?
Go home.
And lock your doors.
Hannah, I'll take you home.
- Come on.
- No.
Oh, no, no.
NIKKl: Come on.
TIBOR: Hannah.
But the Germans said we'd be safe.
Yeah, like the 12,000
they shipped out last week.
MAN:
Let the Jews burn!
Kill the Jews!
Hey, you, Fodor,
whatever your name is.
How do we know we can trust you?
Papa, we can.
He has friends.
They're fighting for us.
Friends? Zionist hoodlums.
- Nikki, what'll we do?
- Follow me.
I know the back alleys.
Eichmann told the council
we would be safe.
We... We would be safe
if we followed orders.
- We are Hungarians.
- Follow me.
EICHMANN: The Führer will tolerate
no further delays
- in eliminating Jewish sabotage.
HORTHY: Colonel Eichmann...
There are still a quarter of a million
Jews in Budapest,
including three individuals
whose wealth and power
you personally continue to shield.
I really must protest.
Colonel Eichmann,
I was an anti-Semite
before you were born.
I bow to no one in my distaste
for the chosen people.
I drafted Hungary's best,
most vigorous anti-Jewish laws.
But death camps like Auschwitz
were never what I had in mind.
Auschwitz, Auschwitz. No.
Even our enemies, by their silence,
acknowledge that we are right
about the Jew.
Colonel, it is tradition in our country
to leave all matters of commerce
and finance to the Jew.
And I am not going to violate
this ancient Hungarian tradition.
- Certain Jews...
- All Jews must go.
You will not be allowed to interfere
any longer with deportations.
Not be allowed?
I will not be spoken to in this...
The Führer demands
a favorable ruling from your cabinet.
The deportations will be intensified.
The final solution
has been set in motion.
JACOB:
Your behavior was outrageous.
You humiliated your mother.
It's a good thing von Fremd
is a tolerant man.
Tolerant? Germany's collapsing,
he needs your money
for all those ambitious new projects
such as Auschwitz.
MAJ:
Raoul.
Is that really a good investment,
Uncle?
MAJ:
Oh, Raoul, please.
You're not only impertinent,
you're naive.
Of course we do business
with the Germans.
Who hasn't?
But we are also working closely
with the anti-Hitler movement.
Banking is not a business
for moralists.
And you certainly demonstrated that
when we sent you to Heifer in '37.
Somehow I wasn't made to sit
behind a desk and say no to people.
But instead
of calculating exchange rates,
you brooded into your wine glass
and talked philosophy
with your new friends.
Brooded? We did that some.
We also talked about movies
and women.
Oh, please, stop, both of you.
Raoul, with your goading.
And, Jacob, you do make Raoul out
such a dilettante.
It simply isn't true.
He worked very well in Heifer.
He always works well,
at the university and as an architect.
I thought his plans for the new spa
were quite stunning.
The fact that you and your brother
rejected them
tells more about your own limitations
than about Raoul's.
JACOB: The bath he designed for it
was outrageous.
It was brilliant.
Not really, Mother.
But my quick cork, that was brilliant.
Popped right out of the bottle
without a corkscrew.
And without a single customer
among wine merchants everywhere.
But was I discouraged? Never.
I went right on
to cheap Japanese zippers,
which led directly
to my current involvement
with a middle-European
trading company,
Where I'm a leading authority
on the importation
of smoked goose breast
and pickled cucumbers.
JACOB:
Kalman Lauer is a generous man,
and his philanthropic zeal has led him
to offer you a desk and a phone
and to send you off to any place
where your gift of languages
could be useful to him.
Not to mention your talent
for locating the wild truffle.
A talent I share with rooting hogs.
Raoul,
you said you were drilling
your home guards this afternoon.
- Can you drop me off in town?
- Yes.
JACOB:
Don't turn away from this, Maj.
- I'm not turning away from anything.
- Please don't deny it.
You have confided to me your sorrow
at Raoul's indifference.
RAOUL:
Indifference?
JACOB:
Towards having a worthy career.
- That's a source of sorrow for me too.
RAOUL: Uncle.
Just the opposite may be true.
I have felt so keenly
the enormous advantages I came into,
the privilege,
the love that has surrounded me.
And I'm afraid
I've made so little of it all.
That I find myself going about my
business in the middle of a nightmare,
trading shrewdly for shipments
of wild truffles in countries
where people are herded like cattle
into freight cars and gas chambers.
JACOB:
We can't change the world.
The war is practically over.
The nightmare will end.
But if you go on wandering through life
in search of perfect justice,
you'll starve, my boy.
Swedes don't starve, Uncle.
They're neutral.
Especially Wallenbergs.
MAN 1: The assignment requires
an experienced diplomat.
MAN 2: It also calls for
a persuasive one, doctor,
and it looks like our man
just qualified himself.
MAN 3:
Once Raoul makes a commitment...
Now, just for your information,
our American ambassador
has talked to your foreign ministry
and we're sure
that they'll respond favorably.
Oh, Raoul, you're improving.
Only 25 minutes late.
My apologies, Kalman.
Iver Olsen,
my friend Raoul Wallenberg.
- How do you do?
- I believe you already know Dr. Preiss.
- Always a pleasure.
- Indeed, sir.
Well, I hear
that we're practically fellow Americans.
Well, you spent five years
in Michigan, didn't you?
RAOUL:
Much more. Maine to Mexico.
Nice to see you, sir. Champagne?
Beer, please.
My champagne cousins
own the hotel,
so the employees
are under the misconception
that I have some share
in the Wallenberg fortune.
WAITER: Sir.
RAOUL: Thank you.
- Skoal.
LAUER: Skoal.
As you know, Mr. Olsen's
with the War Refugee Board
set up by President Roosevelt.
Yes, we're looking for someone
to represent us in Budapest.
Mr. Lauer has told me
that the purpose of your organization
is to save the 250,000 Jews
left in Hungary.
Then you can understand why it is
so important to choose the right man.
LAUER: Dr. Preiss is head of the
Jewish Committee here in Stockholm.
OLSEN: Yes, as foreigners,
we thought it proper
to consult with an advisory group.
I've told Mr. Olsen
about the many trips
you've taken for me to Budapest.
Business as well as in search
of my wife's family.
He knows the city.
He has contacts.
But Dr. Preiss still has his doubts
about me.
Only about your seriousness,
Mr. Wallenberg.
If I am selected
and if the Foreign Office agrees
to give me the latitude I need,
I would be relentless, gentlemen.
You'd be a fully accredited
Swedish diplomat
attached to the legation.
What the mystery writers call
"a cover."
Ha. Precisely.
Now, my contact tells me
that your country is ready
to increase its representation.
And they're fully aware of the purpose
you mentioned, to save Jews?
Cautiously aware, I'd say.
I'm told even Swedish Jews
are cautious.
That they occasionally suffer
what my American friends call
the Mayflower complex.
Which is?
The fear of crowding the vault
if too many more Jews come here.
Tell me, doctor,
would it militate against me
if you knew I would go to any length
to save lives in Budapest?
Including the promise
of Swedish citizenship
to as many Jews as possible?
I would answer saying
that you have expressed
your seriousness most eloquently.
Amen to that.
GABOR: This is dreadful.
Quite dreadful. It won't do at all.
- It doesn't fit. None of it fits.
- Ha-ha-ha.
GABOR: The whole of it is just
one long piece of green.
You are like a little boy
with a new soldier suit.
- Look at all these buttons.
- Stand still.
Gabor, we must get this aligned.
Ga...
God, I adore you.
If the jacket isn't right,
it must go back to the tailor.
The fit isn't right.
All the decent tailors in Budapest
were Jews.
Well, Gabor,
where have they all gone?
Who knows?
They are such a mysterious breed.
I don't know.
I've met so few Jewish people.
It's one of the advantages
of a convent upbringing.
Three successive convents.
You can't imagine
what a welcome sight you were
after all those sisters.
And I thought it was the Italian men
who suffered by comparison.
So they did, my love.
Actually, this uniform
is quite good for me.
And the arm band,
it gives it some flair.
- Panache.
- Yes.
And how grateful I am
to your cosmopolitan background.
You were taught not only
to speak French,
but to make love like the French.
Such things cannot be taught,
Gabor.
- Isn't the green a bit poisonous?
- Green is green.
What do the crossed arrows
stand for?
Now, that is an old Magyar symbol.
Honor, courage, virtue.
Supremacy over Bolshevism
and the Jewish menace.
Why are they a menace?
That is enough about politics
for one day.
But if I don't ask,
how will I ever learn?
You've already filled your pretty head
with more than enough questions.
- Gabor, I have one more question.
- If you must.
What did Monsignor Rotha mean
when he asked God
to forgive everyone
who kept silent about the Jews?
The nuncio is a meddlesome
old woman.
Does that invalidate his prayers?
That is a second question.
Gabor, if what he implies has
actually happened to those people...
Those people are unworthy
of another moment's time
as our senile regent
will learn shortly.
- Gabor.
- Yes.
Eichmann is losing patience
with Admiral Horthy
for trying to suspend
Jewish transports.
Horthy is trying as well as Rotha.
It's my feeling the Germans
will soon replace the old man
with one of our people,
the Arrow Cross,
which would make your husband
the new foreign minister.
You, Gabor?
The foreign minister?
How wonderful.
Isn't it?
How wonderful.
- Here it is. May I take this?
- Mm-hm.
- Be careful.
- Nobody picks on Lutherans.
Besides, I'm the most cautious man
in the world.
Ugh. What a dreadful liar.
When you were little,
you'd run into a lightning storm
and dare the other children to follow.
- You called it God's fireworks.
- Did I? I don't remember.
I've tried to be mother
and father to you.
He would have liked you
to be a naval officer.
Mother, I'm a diplomat. Overnight.
Second secretary of the legation.
Not bad
- for an importer of goose breasts.
- Hmm.
Take that.
So you'll write to me
and come home for visits?
Certainly by Christmas, Mother.
Why do you feel
you have to go to Hungary?
Even Jacob and Fredrik
say it's dangerous.
I think you know.
I would...
I would explode
if I missed this opportunity.
I know. I know and I understand.
I'll miss you.
I love you, my son.
And I'll always love you, Mother.
- Where are we?
- Austria.
We should have crossed the border
long ago,
if we hadn't stopped for the bombing.
I thought Goering said they couldn't
reach this far with the bombers.
Idiot. He still thinks
there's a Luftwaffe left.
Goering said if they ever bomb
Germany, they could call him Meyer.
That fat bum? He's Meyer,
Isador and Abraham by now.
Papers, travel documents and IDs.
Sweden?
Second secretary
of the Swedish Legation in Budapest.
Traveling like
an infantry replacement.
I had little choice, sergeant.
Sorry.
Diplomat, huh? I never met one.
What does a second secretary do?
Oh, import-export licenses, trade.
You know, a Hungarian salami
for a Swedish herring.
MAN:
Hungarian border.
Out. Everybody out.
Bring your papers down.
And one valise.
Yes, come out. Do what you heard.
Only head count and registration.
Come down.
Any Jew strong enough to work
goes to the labor brigades.
- Yes.
- This goes for kids and girls.
- The rest go to the train.
SOLDIER 1: Everybody out.
RABBl: Come, children,
you know we have to go.
SOLDIER 1: Everybody in this building
must come out.
Our Hungarian police
will treat us decently.
Fodor.
Fodor.
Chaim, you're in charge.
Everyone downstairs. Fodor!
Fodor!
Oh, you fool. Put the knife away.
Come out with the rest of us.
Look, they have the names
of everyone here in the building.
You are a janitor.
Look, if you don't come out,
they'll torture me,
kill the students.
No, I'm not going.
I'll hide out with Teicholz.
Teicholz?
Your resistance movement is a joke.
SOLDIER 1: Where is the professor?
Where's the rest of them?
SOLDIER 2: Go and line up.
Line up. Four and five.
Get out of my way, Rabbi.
Tell them I'm dead.
SOLDIER 1:
Come out. Come on, hurry.
Do you understand?
Come out. Come on.
Hurry, hurry. Show me your papers.
- Hannah. Where is she?
- That cannot be everybody.
- Oh, have you seen my daughter?
- What are you waiting for? Go.
- Everybody must go.
- I don't know where she is.
SOLDIER 1:
Line up in the street. Line up.
Quietly. Quietly.
Hannah.
You can't be here.
- Why not?
- Because no place is safe.
We have to go.
My father says
I can't see you anymore.
He's got bigger worries than me.
They took him away.
They've cleaned out the block.
I have to hide you.
HANNAH: What will they do to him?
- I don't know.
Maybe they'll put him to work.
They've got 15,000 digging trenches
outside the city.
Oh, my God.
- We have to help him.
- No, we have to help ourselves.
- How?
- We'll make a run for it.
We'll find Teicholz.
Come on.
What's wrong?
They won't take us all away,
will they?
No, no, no. Of course not.
- I have to go home.
- Listen.
You go back and you'll die. You'll die.
Come.
Hey, "street rat"
your father calls me, eh?
Eh? Eh? Ha-ha.
Street rat.
Well, street rats know the alleyways.
Come on.
SOLDIER 1:
Stay together.
Get in line. Move.
SOLDIER 2:
Stay back. Stay back.
SOLDIER 3:
Move back.
SOLDIER 4:
Stay inside. Only one at a time.
MAN 1:
Come on, please.
MAN 2:
Hey, let us in.
MAN 3:
Please.
WOMAN:
Why do they do nothing?
Your identification, sir, please.
PER: Be sure that you keep this
with you at all times,
or I can't be responsible
for the consequences.
But otherwise, there should be...
- You wouldn't be Raoul Wallenberg?
- Oh, but I would.
We've been expecting you.
Excuse me. My name is Per Anger,
second secretary here.
Just a moment and I'll take you up
to meet Minister Danielsson.
There, I'm sure you'll sleep
a little better
with this Swedish pass
under your pillow.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Above-mentioned to be regarded
as protected
by the Royal Swedish Legation.
Only if they can establish
a family or a business connection.
- There must be a limit.
RAOUL: Why?
You know, these security passes
could use more filigree,
more gold in the pattern.
Germans respect that.
Please.
DANIELSSON: I swear,
that crowd gets bigger every day.
Word spreads quickly.
One can hardly blame them.
Eichmann's preparing
to make mass arrests.
Setting up deportations again.
This time, I'm afraid worse
than Horthy's latest suspension.
Well, Wallenberg,
this is now your project.
What do you suggest?
First, sir, these passes,
which are a remarkable idea,
might be issued
in much greater numbers.
- Oh, you mean thousands?
- I mean as many as there are Jews.
In effect, to make honorary Swedes
of them all.
DANIELSSON :
No.
No, that's impossible.
We could never follow through on that.
Eichmann wouldn't tolerate it.
We won't know till we've tried.
The Germans will be soon
seeking our goodwill.
The Hungarians already are.
Nevertheless,
we should do nothing in haste.
I'll set up a meeting with Horthy
in the next few days.
With the minister's permission,
I've already made the appointment.
With my permission?
Sir, under the terms of my agreement
with the Foreign Office,
I am authorized to do so
without going through channels.
I verified the appointment
this morning
when I delivered King Gustaf's
latest telegram to Horthy's office.
Would it be too much to ask,
since you appear unstoppable,
if you could operate with discretion?
Not at all, sir.
Toward that end, I will also ask you
to employ as few people as possible.
I'm afraid that won't be easy.
I intend to use my funds
to hire 100 people.
I'll need secretaries, drivers, clerks,
printers, maintenance personnel.
But it won't cost the legation
a krona.
I was more concerned
with our neutrality
than with the money.
Precisely why I decided to hire staff
from outside the legation.
These will all be Jews.
In that connection, sir,
I would like to work with Wallenberg.
Since I was the one
who initiated the rescue effort,
I could provide continuity.
Well, your charm has certainly
had its effect, Wallenberg.
Very well.
But in no way must the crown
or this legation be compromised.
No, sir.
We are the leading neutral power
in Budapest.
We must not offend anybody.
Jeopardize that condition,
you lose our support.
Understood.
EICHMANN: Before we go any further,
I beg you to come to me
if anyone tries to harm you.
I will punish those responsible,
even if they are German soldiers.
But, and this is the reason
for my calling together your council,
your people must not try
to mislead me, or they will regret it.
I have been handling Jewish affairs
for ten years, so nobody can fool me.
My main task is to raise the output
of the war factories,
and Jewish labor is essential for this.
Heh-heh.
There is so much
hysterical propaganda among you
that sometimes I despair
of reaching my work quotas
without resorting to the use of force.
I need 400 volunteers
at this moment.
If they work hard,
no harm will come to them.
Of course, the yellow star
will have to be worn.
This will have to be
more strictly enforced.
But, colonel, you have given us...
However, these sudden measures
that I will announce soon
will only last until the end of the war.
Once, please God, this is given to us,
you will find us Germans
the good-humored fellows
we were before.
Excuse me a moment.
what is it?
Horthy has ordered
the train to Kistarcsa stopped.
- Well?
- We had 12,437 Jews,
a new record, I believe,
on the way to Birkenau camp.
Now the Hungarians
are turning the train around
and are leading it back
into Budapest.
Wisleceny, we will not be stopped.
We will carry on until we clean every
piece of Jew crap out of Hungary.
And, Vilmos, please find a larger car.
A limousine, we'll need more room.
I want to make it into an office
on wheels, a supply truck,
maybe even an ambulance.
Cannot promise much these days.
An old Buick, maybe.
Don't promise,
just get me what I need.
My God. Wonderful.
Listen to this.
"Informant in Horthy's office
tells me your personal note
together with King Gustaf's telegram
led the region
to stop Jewish deportation train,
turn it back at border.
Twelve thousand or more Jews."
Yes. Yes.
"The papal nuncio, Monsignor Rotha,
has heard of our mission, applauds,
and he wants to join forces."
VILMOS: That's wonderful, wonderful.
- Oh, Vilmos.
Pick up the medical supplies
at the dock in the Danube.
They've just come through
on my orders to Vienna.
- Yes, sir.
- Raoul, vice-consul.
- I'll take it on my phone.
- He's just going to his desk.
Thank you.
Consul Lutz, Wallenberg.
How kind of you to return my call.
Do you agree
we need an urgent meeting
to coordinate action? Huh?
Yes, all neutral diplomats.
The Spanish, Portuguese.
RAOUL: I'll call you back.
PER: You must wait your turn.
Nothing can be done this way. Please.
You must wait your turn.
RAOUL:
What's happening here?
- Please, get back.
RAOUL: No, you must go down.
Come. Come, get back.
Listen to me. Listen to me.
We were trying to be fair.
We can help only so many,
but we can help none of you
if you act like this.
You're playing favorites. The rich ones.
You're selling passes.
- No, sir.
WOMAN: Mr. Wallenberg is right.
We mustn't act like this.
Let's go outside and wait our turn.
PER: Please. From the back,
please go down the stairs.
Yes, she's right. Go on back down.
WOMAN: Could you go back?
- Young lady, young lady.
What is your name?
PER: If you'll just form a queue outside.
- Sonja Kahn. My son, Josef.
Josef.
Do you have any connection
with Sweden?
Once I knew a Swedish girl
in summer camp.
She taught me how to tie my shoe.
It was 15 years ago.
Do you work?
I was a teacher,
but we were all dismissed.
- But actually, I'm a good typist.
- Ah.
Do you speak and write German?
And English, French, Italian,
and of course, Hungarian.
We'll hire you.
Eva, you have a new helper.
I will find you a desk somewhere,
a typewriter, a telephone.
Now you have
your Swedish connection.
- You're an employee of the legation.
- Thank you.
- Like to meet your fellow Swedes?
- Oh, yes.
Josi, hurry home and wait for me.
Go on.
- Where is your husband?
- No one can tell.
He was picked up a month ago
for no reason.
I don't know where he is.
Well, you will be safe here.
Excuse me.
It's getting out of hand here.
You know, Danielsson wants us
to find new quarters.
Good. We need more room.
Seven hundred passes? Ridiculous.
We need a new document,
a whole new direction.
Something broader.
Something more forceful.
Swedish royal colors.
It's looking better.
But why not the royal seal as well?
Just here.
"The Royal Swedish Legation
in Budapest
confirms that above-mentioned person
will travel to Sweden
on course for repatriation."
Et cetera, et cetera. "Valid for a single
and specific trip to Sweden."
Yeah, looks lovely. Reads nicely.
Do you think they'll honor it?
It's too impressive to ignore.
A splendid job,
but you must keep this work secret.
Oh, and random numbers
on the documents.
- Keep the Germans guessing.
MAN: Yes, sir.
Come on, Per. I know where we
can get a shipment of powdered ink.
Pity your wife has to miss the fun.
Yeah, Elena adores it here
at the Arizona,
but it's too soon after the baby.
She insisted I expose you
to a little cosmopolitan chic.
That must be Eichmann.
RAOUL: Waiter.
WAITER: Yes, sir?
- What's your best champagne?
- Pommery, sir.
Please take a bottle
to Colonel Eichmann with this note.
WAITER: Right away, sir.
- You read the dossier?
Up from the bottom. A drifter, toady.
He's on his feet saluting
before his superior enters his office.
And I hear he's an avid collector.
Oh, yes.
Jewish silver, Jewish china,
Jewish pianos.
WAITER:
Colonel Eichmann.
SINGER:
"My dear colonel,
please accept this modest gift
from the Royal Swedish Legation,
which has heard so much about you.
Raoul Wallenberg,
second secretary."
SINGER:
Since my man and I
Wallenberg?
- Have we met him, Gabor?
- No, I don't think so.
Lisl, you know what it is
to be a Rockefeller in America?
That's what it means
to be a Wallenberg in Sweden.
But they don't send Wallenbergs
to be errand boys.
- Do they, colonel?
- No.
Excuse me, baroness,
the Reich is obliged
to keep the neutrals happy.
This man is clearly
not an errand boy.
Please.
EICHMANN: Mr. Anger,
Swedish Legation, I believe?
Colonel Eichmann,
how nice to see you.
- May I introduce Mr. Wall...
- Raoul Wallenberg.
Thank you for the Pommery.
You're the banking family.
Just a poor cousin.
Trying my hand at a bit of diplomacy.
A pleasure to meet you, colonel.
A bit of diplomacy.
A privilege of aristocrats
to try on jobs like clothing.
What are your duties at the legation?
I'm here to...
To help you
with your Jewish problem.
Help me?
Well, what can Sweden offer?
Freight cars?
Winter clothing?
Please, don't try to camouflage
your mission.
You have been sent here
by the Americans
to prevent us
from dealing with the Jews.
My orders come
from the King of Sweden.
A humanitarian mission?
I am a humanitarian myself.
We are not harming Jews.
We're protecting them.
Good. We simply want
to make that job easier.
EICHMANN: By issuing those
laughable Swedish documents?
The Hungarian government
has recognized our passes, colonel.
RAOUL: In connection with the Jews
who hold those passes, colonel,
we will be needing
protected houses for them.
Buildings that will fly
the Swedish flag.
EICHMANN:
That is ingenious, Wallenberg.
- How many houses do you need?
- At least 40.
I have twice that number
under my control.
Houses that I have requisitioned.
How much can you pay?
I would say $200,000
in Swedish kronor.
You don't put much value
on your Hebrews.
The Americans offered me $2 million
for the Jews of Slovakia,
and you propose 200,000.
It's barely a dollar a Jew.
It seems a generous amount
for houses you got for nothing.
But I want interest
on my investment.
I can see why you don't work
for your family's bank.
Delightful meeting you, colonel.
I don't mean to compromise
your authority.
I want to cooperate.
You can cooperate by letting us handle
the Jewish question in our own way.
Your errand running
between King Gustaf and Horthy
was a failure, by the way.
Oh, yes, the Hungarian intervention
stopped one trainload
of Jewish laborers
much needed in our war factories.
But this morning,
we got through twice as many.
Two trains.
So we made up
for your little delay, see?
Hitler. Hitler.
Bloodhound.
Isn't that that what he likes
to call himself?
I warned you
about his determination.
Some Nazis are less interested
in the war
than they are in murdering Jews.
I am determined too, Per.
And stubborn.
Who's the beauty?
PER:
Baroness Elisabeth Kemeny.
A family tree
that includes two popes
and a holy Roman emperor.
To your health, baroness.
There is a woman full of secrets.
RAOUL:
May I pass on to Your Highness
my government's deep appreciation
of your response
to His Majesty's recent message.
Please be brief, Wallenberg.
The regent is a busy man.
My colleagues and I salute
your brave efforts
to stop the death trains,
even though Eichmann
countermanded your orders.
These are worthless.
Worthless?
HORTHY: Oh, more impressive
than the previous design,
but they have no validity
in international law.
They violate Hungarian sovereignty
by taking our citizens
away from Hungarian law
and placing them
under Swedish jurisdiction.
- No, it cannot be that.
FERENCZY: Dangerous nonsense.
We're only trying
to make your work easier.
To take the Jews off your hands.
And I'm sure the colonel
has more pressing matters
than arresting children.
HORTHY: I have suspended
deportations several times,
but it is essential that I do not
antagonize the Germans.
These passes, as you call them,
will make things worse.
Highness, this telegram
has arrived for you.
At the legation.
Good heavens, another message
from the King of Sweden.
You hear that, Ferenczy?
"That you take every measure
to terminate deportations
of Jewish citizens
in the interest of humanity
and take steps to protect..."
King Gustaf is a Christian.
Why does he care so much
about Jews?
Ha. But then, of course,
you have so few of them in Sweden.
I believe His Majesty's concern
transcends religions
or national borders.
Well, I trust
you will inform His Majesty
that within limitations,
I am doing my best.
We shall indeed, Highness.
But on that subject,
our diplomatic pouch also contained
a new analysis
of the military situation.
Including the statement
of an American general
saying that he would soon
fight his way into Berlin
and shoot Hitler in the head
as if he were a snake.
May I remind you
that Germany is our ally.
There is now little doubt
that the Reich is doomed,
and there will be a day of retribution,
trials for war criminals.
FERENCZY: How dare you intimidate
His Highness?
Ferenczy. Shh.
What is it you want?
Not I, Highness. Sweden.
It is King Gustav who hopes you will
join us in this humane endeavor.
Come to the point, Wallenberg.
You've made admirable efforts,
Highness.
But you have only suspended
deportations.
Why not cancel them
once and for all?
Exempt all Jews
who hold Swedish passes
from wearing the yellow star.
- Expel Eichmann.
- You are a brash young man.
Highness, there is great urgency.
RAOUL: Look upon me
as a sympathetic witness,
someone who can testify
on your behalf.
I ask you
to inform all officials
that this document must be respected.
Let us distribute these
to the Jews of Budapest.
- How many?
- Fifty thousand.
Impossible.
HORTHY:
I will authorize 4,500 passes.
The recipients must renounce
their Hungarian citizenship.
- Only 4,500?
- Be grateful for that.
And I shall hold you to your promise.
You will tell the allies
of my benevolent treatment of Jews.
RAOUL:
When you give this to Dr. Levi,
he will look somewhat suspiciously
at your collar, but finally,
he'll give you all the delousing powder
you need from his clinic.
I'm sure of it.
You have instructed me well
in underground ways.
You're an apt pupil,
And I welcome support
from the clergy.
But I'm not sure the Vatican
shares our concern.
I am afraid there are always
political considerations.
I meant our moral concerns.
VILMOS:
There he is.
His name is Darwas.
Very rich, but maybe not for long.
I'll leave you now.
I can walk easily from here.
You're sure? There'll be no trouble?
Your appointment looks
nervous enough without my presence.
Don't forget, tomorrow night
at the Vatican embassy.
I'll be there,
RAOUL:
Mr. Darwas, Raoul Wallenberg.
Oh, yes.
- From the Swedish embassy.
- Yes.
- Let's walk.
- Of course.
- Your houses are nearby?
- Yes. These three.
There are three more in Buda.
I want you to donate your houses.
The Swedish government will
hold them in trust until the war is over.
I need safe houses
for the Jewish people I'll be protecting.
They are all I own.
My children will inherit them.
Mr. Darwas,
do you know what Aryanization is?
What Eichmann has been doing?
Hmm. He calls it dejewification.
As soon as the Nazis crack down
on Horthy,
Eichmann will Aryanize
everything in sight.
Mr. Darwas,
if you donate your houses to me,
they'll save Jewish lives,
and you will get them back.
DARWAS:
Oh, there's the last of my houses.
RAOUL:
Oh. Wonderful.
But you can give me no assurances.
You have no army, no police.
Your only assurance
is that Eichmann will kill every Jew
in Budapest unless we fight him.
If we don't fight him,
we don't deserve to live,
in houses or in caves,
for that matter.
Who are you to lecture me?
A nice Swedish boy
with nothing at stake.
Not true, Darwas. I'm one of you.
I'm half Jewish.
Don't you see I'm fighting
for my own life as well?
Will this entitle me to one of those
Swedish documents of yours?
A mint copy.
DARWAS:
Hmm.
All right, then.
Let me tell my family
and I'll call you tonight.
Half Jewish?
You told me that your
great-great-grandfather was Jewish.
All right, I'm one-sixteenth.
Call me a liar for a fraction.
Ha-ha.
The wildness of the imagination.
Why not, Vilmos? I feel half Jewish.
Not bad. Not bad at all.
The Swede is doing a good job.
I had to stand in line all night long
outside the legation to pinch that.
Oh, poor boy,
we are so hard on you.
Schiffrin,
can you forge copies for us?
When Schiffrin the counterfeiter
is finished,
the Nazis will think mine are real,
his are fakes.
I want you to print 15,000.
On top of what Wallenberg's
printing?
The Germans will get suspicious.
Are you working with Wallenberg
or are you working with me?
Who is he, anyway,
an overnight messiah?
All I know is the police are pulling
more men off the street
for labor brigades every day.
You're right. Raise the order.
Print 20,000 of these.
We'll give Mr. Wallenberg
more help than he expected.
The paper, I can get.
The color of the ink is the problem.
Get Schiffrin whatever he needs.
HANNAH:
Why always Nikki?
He's the youngest.
Nikki, put on the green jacket.
You make a good fascist, kid.
RAOUL:
Ah.
- This can't be everyone, Sonja.
SONJA: No, it's about half.
The others are afraid.
RAOUL:
Get after them. Telephone them.
They must move.
Your people must help me.
Through the power invested in me,
by His Majesty,
King Gustav of Sweden,
I hereby designate this building
Swedish territory
under the protection
of the Royal Swedish Legation.
The Swedish flag. For them?
Yes, captain.
Well, Sonja will assign rooms.
It won't be the Gellért Hotel,
but you will be safe.
- Can you believe it?
- Go on, go on.
CAPTAIN: You have a savior.
- Vilmos, hurry up.
CAPTAIN: Hey, I know you don't believe
in a savior, but you have a savior.
Come on. Come on.
Go on and be brave.
- Go on, go on.
MAN: All right.
CAPTAIN:
Come on.
- Good morning, sergeant.
SERGEANT: Good morning.
You must be the men assigned
to guard our new annex
of the Swedish Legation.
CAPTAIN: Come on.
SERGEANT: What?
Didn't you know? Colonel Ferenczy
has approved several houses
under the protection
of the Swedish flag.
If this is your patrol area,
you are obviously responsible.
CAPTAIN:
Come on, you Jews.
Those are Jews.
It's hard to tell without the yellow star,
isn't it?
You will see that no one violates
the diplomatic status of this building.
Honor that command and I will
recommend you for promotion.
That will be all.
Come along, come along,
don't be afraid.
Just follow that bunch of Swedes.
Come on.
Let's go. We'll get him later.
Yes, Mr. Derrick.
Forgive the late hour.
Yes, my staff can work 20 hours
a day, so I can hardly do less.
Mr. Derrick, could you ask your friends
for three more trucks?
No, I know how difficult it is,
but we need them to distribute food
to the safe houses.
Oh, wait just a moment.
Carry it with you at all times, and
remember, you're a Swedish citizen.
- I beg your pardon?
- We bless the name of the Almighty.
RAOUL: Thank you.
- And you, Mr. Anger.
VILMOS: The map.
Mr. Wallenberg, we have the map.
RAOUL:
You will have them? Thank you.
SONJA:
Of the safe houses?
VILMOS: Yes.
SONJA: Raoul, the map is here.
Well, at last we have it.
Are Darwas' houses marked?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Mama, pick a good house
for us and my friends.
We'll go where we are assigned,
Josi.
JOSEF:
Mama, look.
Colonel Eichmann.
Major.
What an honor.
Heh. Please, everybody.
Go back to work. Go back to work.
I am aware
that this is Swedish territory.
We respect the Swedes.
Even new ones. Right, major?
We did not expect you, colonel.
I apologize for the breach
of etiquette, and at this late hour,
but we couldn't leave Budapest
without saying goodbye.
- Leave?
- Your... cooperation
has been so successful that we
are going home for a little holiday.
Josef.
Josef, fetch coffee
for the colonel and the major.
We'll only be a moment.
May I see
one of those magical cards
that changes Hungarians
into Swedes?
Of course.
Here.
Admiral Horthy has given his blessing
to these documents.
Ha-ha-ha. "Above-mentioned person
and his home to be regarded
as protected by the Royal
Swedish Legation in Budapest."
Creating Swedes
with a stroke of your
Oh, there is no magic involved,
colonel.
EICHMANN:
Carry on.
Carry on.
Carry on.
Oh, don't believe the stories you hear
about Colonel Eichmann.
Actually, I have never had a bad time
with a Jew.
As you can see, I am most tolerant
of Mr. Wallenberg's little exercise.
Good evening, colonel.
Good evening, major.
Hitler.
"Don't believe the stories you hear
about Colonel Eichmann, huh?
Actually, I've never had a bad time
with a Jew."
All right, all of you, back to work.
In the Third Reich,
nobody loafs on the job except me.
PER:
What do you think?
Could we really be winning here?
Better to hope than not.
Especially for them.
Maybe this is why Horthy
withdrew almost 2,000
of his gendarmes to the countryside.
He's deliberately left Eichmann
too shorthanded
to continue his house cleaning.
It's my guess Eichmann's going home
to ask his Führer for more strength.
Let's hope the Führer declines.
Meanwhile,
with the Russians advancing,
we might be winning.
SOLDIER 1:
Get the medic.
SOLDIER 2: All right, this way,
this way. I need three more men.
Make sure you do not
run out of ammunition.
SOLDIER 3: The street behind.
SOLDIER 4: You see?
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Can't finish it off?
SOLDIER 5:
A few of the kids left.
- They're cleaning them out.
- Get it over with.
Shh.
MAN:
Go.
- Mother Mary...
- What is this?
You realize you might have shot
my wife?
I am Baron Kemeny.
What is going on here?
SOLDIER:
It's the resistance, sir.
Jews hiding in the factory
opened fire on us.
Women and children.
SOLDIER:
We have to teach them a lesson.
Colonel Eichmann
left so few SS behind.
We must set an example
to maintain discipline.
Yes, I understand that,
but there must be a coordinated plan.
The gendarmerie
with our Arrow Cross
and whatever remaining SS
- dealing with the Jews.
SOLDIER: Yes, sir.
GABOR: Driver.
- Gabor, why?
Old traditions, old hatreds.
Some of them valid, you know.
After all, our people have suffered.
And with the Russians
getting closer,
the Jews could virtually open
the city gates to the Bolsheviks. Shh.
Let's go.
Shh. It's all right.
MAN 1:
Move, Jews.
MAN 2:
Keep moving.
Come on. Move.
RAOUL:
Good work, good work.
Let's get the rubble cleared out
of this passageway, huh? Move.
Per Anger's bringing
a busload of orphans in one hour.
So let's get finished here as quickly
as possible and get cleaned up
so we can tuck them into their beds
like the proper nannies we are.
All right, we'll do what we can.
SOLDIER 1:
This way.
SOLDIER 2:
Look ahead. Go on, move.
Come on, Vikings, let's show them
how a Swedish brigade works.
- Come on.
- We'll show them now.
MAN 1: Come on.
MAN 2: Good work.
LISL: Thank you.
MAN 3: With your hands.
Come on, that's it.
- On to the lorry.
LISL: Mr. Wallenberg?
- Baroness?
- We have not met.
No, but I almost
introduced myself to you once.
I have heard such remarkable things
about you.
I had to take this opportunity
to speak with you.
Well, then may I buy you coffee?
I'm told Hungarians are never too busy
to stop for coffee.
Even those who are half Italian
and half Austrian.
You have done research.
- I won't take you from your work.
- No, I have many helpers.
Just give me one moment.
Thank you.
Shall we go? Just across the square.
Please, you are getting wet.
- Share this.
- Thank you.
It's astonishing
how so many lovely things survive,
even in the midst of catastrophe.
Please, Mr. Wallenberg.
I don't indulge in sidewalk flirtations.
As it happens, I do.
I'm also grateful
for chance encounters.
This was not by chance.
Monsignor Rotha
told me where to find you.
Ah.
A Queen of England
so admired that espresso machine
that she ordered one just like it.
Took it home with her.
Which queen?
Oh, I am embarrassed.
I should know.
I went to school in England.
So we are both recipients
of Anglo-Saxon educations.
I am told you came here
to help the Jewish people.
Yes, and I'm finding it
a painfully difficult business.
Would you like a pastry?
- No, thank you.
- Yes, yes. I insist.
Have a chocolate square.
I'll have an almond bar.
If only to reassure ourselves
that the ovens of Budapest
are still turning out splendid pastry.
I think I know
what you were implying
with your use of the word "ovens."
But I can honestly tell you
that I find it
difficult to believe.
Decent people always find it difficult
to accept obscenity.
- I am not a child.
- No, no.
But you are a neophyte, baroness,
in this matter of genocide.
Isn't that why you sought me out?
I am not sure why I am here.
I heard of your mission.
And I felt I had to hear
your side of it.
- So did the nuncio.
- There are no sides.
There are only facts.
There are places where millions
of innocent people are put to death.
Dear God.
After they are stripped of everything
and murdered,
their bodies are burnt in vast ovens.
The sky over a part of Poland is murky,
full of soot.
The stench of death
permeates everything.
Forgive my ignorance.
Forgive me, I have...
I have forgotten my manners.
But, baroness, I need your help.
What could I do?
The Jews of Budapest
are the last survivors.
- We can save them.
- How?
Your husband is in a position
to help me stop this insane slaughter.
You have heard that my husband
will be the next foreign minister
- if there's a change of government.
- Yes, I have.
And you must convince him
to reverse this policy of extermination,
or he will pay for it
along with the others.
He is not like the others.
But it would be so very difficult
to make him understand.
Baroness.
When the fighting ends,
he will be tried as a criminal
unless he makes an act of contrition.
Now.
Excuse me.
NIKKl:
Hey, Teicholz.
If the Russians don't get here soon,
what do we do then?
Get Hannah to change your dressing.
Your brains are leaking.
Heh. My brains are leaking.
- It felt good to hit back.
- Nikki.
We sit around and pray or talk
and call each other names.
Socialist, communist,
Zionist, orthodox.
All that talk, talk, talk.
When we're finished
insulting each other, they'll kill us.
Not all of us. And not the children.
Please go to Wallenberg.
At least put Rachel and Jed
into one of his orphan homes.
Forget the Swede.
We can take care of our own.
We are all doing all right
with our passes.
Wallenberg started it.
He's just another goy, Fodor.
Ow.
When Eichmann comes back,
and he will,
you better be damn sure
who's really on your side.
- A young boy is...
- What do you mean?
Listen.
MAN:
Raoul Wallenberg,
second secretary
of the Swedish Legation.
LUTZ:
Good evening, Raoul.
I want you to meet
General Schmidthuber.
Surely you've heard
of Raoul Wallenberg.
He's been outdoing the Red Cross,
setting up soup kitchens and hospitals
for victims of the allied bombardments.
Even the Vatican is impressed.
SCHMIDTHUBER:
As was my colleague, Eichmann.
So much that he has abandoned
Budapest to you.
- You flatter me, general.
SCHMIDTHUBER: Not at all.
You're giving him fits.
Turning Jews into Swedes.
Tell me,
what sort of surgery is involved?
An operation being performed
by a worldwide team
of civilized countries.
Well spoken.
MAN:
Baron and Baroness Gabor Kemeny.
Yes, yes. We're even expecting
Szálasi this evening.
Thank you.
Shall we drink? To our host,
Consul Charles Lutz of Switzerland
and his lovely wife
for this fine reception.
And to all, good health.
And also to the Spanish
and Portuguese ambassadors,
and the papal nuncio
for their growing aid
to suffering humanity.
The Spanish are also
at your service.
Very graceful, my friend.
But stop proselytizing.
We neutrals are the only ones
who can enjoy the amenities
when the walls are crashing
around us.
Oh, Raoul,
have you met Baroness Kemeny
and her husband,
Baron Gabor Kemeny?
Mr. Wallenberg.
What a delight.
Baroness.
- Wallenberg.
RAOUL: How do you do?
ROTHA: Mr. Raoul Wallenberg,
Ferencz Szálasi,
chief of the Arrow Cross Party.
SZÁLASl:
Delighted.
Baroness, what an adornment you are
to Hungary's national pride.
LISL:
Thank you.
But I really know nothing of politics.
We will rescue Hungary for you.
We'll purify its wounded soil.
And you, baroness,
shall be our beacon.
LISL:
You expect too much of me.
Before I can go back to Sweden,
we must assure the security
of the remaining Jews.
We've issued as many passes
as we can.
To Jews of Spanish descent,
those who speak our language.
- How many?
- Seven hundred.
Reparations for the Inquisition?
Gentlemen,
I'm talking about tens of thousands.
A campaign
to put all the Jews under our care.
ROTHA:
I agree.
The pitifully small number we help
with baptismal certificates
or providing sanctuary
in the convents.
It simply is not enough.
Excuse me, gentlemen, I must
rescue the baroness from Szálasi.
It's molestation.
May I have a word with you?
Baroness, may I have the honor
of finishing this dance with you?
If you like.
An unusual mix, huh?
The guest list.
If you mean Szálasi,
unusual is too kind a word.
I understand your husband
is his ardent supporter.
Are you beginning
where you left off that afternoon?
My husband is a diplomat.
Then perhaps
he can use his diplomatic skills
to civilize the Arrow Cross.
And I'm sorry if I offended you.
How do you assume
I can influence him in these matters?
He obviously worships you.
- As he should.
- You are presumptuous.
I have been led to believe
the Swedes were more reserved.
Perhaps it's my Western education.
Among other things,
I developed a taste for democracy
and American music, like this song.
Fools rush in
where angels fear to tread.
Has it occurred to you
that you are rushing into...
Intruding upon my relationship
with my husband?
But not, I hope, as a...
As a fool.
No.
No, no.
Not as a fool.
That pleases me, baroness.
More than I can say.
Excuse me, Wallenberg,
but I wish to dance with my wife.
Of course. Thank you, baroness.
Have you seen Raoul Wallenberg?
LUTZ:
Yes, he's here.
Raoul.
Horthy is about to announce
an armistice with the Russians.
Oh, it's not unexpected.
What does your minister think
will happen?
German occupation.
And not just the odd
Wehrmacht battalion.
Waffen-SS in control everywhere,
and Arrow Cross given a free hand.
They're advancing on Budapest
even now.
Eichmann.
This is what he's been waiting for.
He and that slime, Szálasi.
Of course.
I have the car.
- Excuse us.
- Excuse me.
- I will join you as soon as I can.
RAOUL: Good.
RAOUL:
Move inside, quickly.
Get out, as fast as you can.
RAOUL: That's right.
- Raoul.
RAOUL:
Move inside. Quickly, please.
Horthy has surrendered.
It's on the radio.
He said Germany has lost the war
and he warned the fascists not to fight.
Help get everyone settled.
Beds, food.
- Can we go home?
RAOUL: No.
Please, sir,
we want to see our families.
No more Germans, no more war.
It is safe now.
No, no, it is not safe. You'll be
better off inside. Go on. Go on.
I assure you we'll try to bring
your wives and families here.
Stop! You are in violation
of the Swedish-German treaty.
- I said stop!
- Who the hell are you?
Do you not see the Swedish flag?
This man is under our protection.
Now, release him.
- Go on, go inside.
MAN: Thank you. Thank you.
You dare to violate
our diplomatic status again
and you will answer
to Colonel Szálasi.
Now, get out!
All right?
What did I tell you?
Arrow Cross are going berserk
shooting anyone they can find.
- How many have we got back?
- About a hundred.
- Quickly, quickly.
RAOUL: This way. Move quickly.
PER: Come on. Quickly, inside.
RAOUL: Find a place inside.
We'll try to bring your families.
You. You traitors!
Animals!
Mikki, I will save you! I swear it!
My God, what can I do?
Abdicate, my dear admiral.
Abdicate?
For the good of Hungary, Highness.
And at the request of the Führer.
If I refuse?
Admiral Horthy, if you do not abdicate
in favor of Colonel Szálasi,
your son will be shot.
Find a way to make it clearer to Szálasi
the disagreement is secret.
Hungary sends us
to replace the worn-out workers.
The allied bombings
have cut the trains.
- The rolling stock is scarce.
- They can go on foot. March them.
All Jews remaining in Budapest
to be rounded up
and put into concentration camps
to work.
Damn Hungarians
never do anything properly.
Random shooting,
shoving Jews into the Danube.
- And neutral countries' passes?
- No exceptions. March them.
My friends, I am so pleased
that you responded to my invitation.
- Come, come, come.
MAN: Good morning.
Good morning, good morning,
good morning.
As you can see, I'm back.
But I desperately need
your cooperation.
Now, we must work swiftly
and efficiently.
MAN :are here
TEICHOLZ:
Fodor. Fodor.
Into your clown suit.
NIKKl: What?
- Come on.
Take some of these.
Which ones?
The Swedish passes, our own.
Take them to Óbuda.
There's a work brigade
building tank traps.
You got to smuggle them
to the people.
You heard how bad it is
on the radio.
Are they in charge?
Does it mean...?
Is the Arrow Cross
now running the government?
It means we save
as many of our people as we can.
Any way we can.
Scared?
No.
Yes.
We'll do it.
You'd better.
SOLDIER 1:
Come on, Jew.
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Come on, you.
And you. Move.
SOLDIER 2:
Too weak, huh?
No good.
SOLDIER 3:
Drag him out. Get rid of him.
Jews turn green when they die.
Hey, you don't think it's funny?
HANNAH:
Oh, Papa.
Oh. Oh.
Hannah.
You must get away from here.
- You must get away.
- Forget her.
Take them.
When you get a chance,
give them out.
You risked your neck for these?
The guards don't respect them.
- They spit on them, Hannah.
- No. They can save you.
SOLDIER 4:
Hey.
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing.
Nothing.
HANNAH: I could not find
what I was looking for.
Do you have papers?
SOLDIER 5: Get back to work.
You want soup, you work.
SOLDIER 4:
This is no good.
You're a Jew, aren't you?
NIKKl:
Hey, is there a problem here?
A Jew girl here
has one of those Swedish papers.
They aren't any good.
Sure they are.
Those are the new ones.
I'll take her back to Budapest.
- Arrow Cross intelligence.
- Hey.
Intelligence? You mug, you idiot.
Go away.
Get over there and start digging.
Then we'll have some fun, huh?
Come on, move.
Hey, look, we take care of our Jews.
We're in charge here.
All you do is shoot them
and throw them in the river.
We get a day's work out of them.
Come on. Ah.
- Hey, wait a minute.
SOLDIER 5: Hey.
I don't like you.
SOLDIER 6:
Come on, keep working there.
Why'd you stop him working for?
Keep on. Come on.
All those with Swedish passes,
come forward.
HANNAH :
Come.
I said, all those with Swedish passes,
come forward.
Stupid.
RAOUL: It does not matter if you
have lost them or misplaced them,
or if you have applied
and they have not yet been issued.
We have a record of all persons
holding neutral passes.
- Come forward.
PER: Come on.
Come, we'll look after you.
- Hurry!
SERGEANT: What's going on?
Who the hell are you?
I am the second secretary
of the Royal Swedish Legation.
I'm here to take responsibility
for all workers under our protection.
SOLDIER 7:
Get back to work, all of you.
RAOUL: All persons holding
neutral passes, come forward.
SOLDIER 7:
Get back to the field. Go, Jews, go.
You are being illegally held
in violation of international law.
Come forward. Come.
Sergeant, I'll thank you to assist me
so we can accomplish this
in an orderly manner.
This has all been cleared
with Colonel Eichmann.
Ha-ha-ha. He must be crazy.
You, sir. I know I issued you a pass.
- Please go to the car.
MAN: Thank you.
Raoul, come down.
You've got three seconds
to climb down, mister,
or I'm going to blow your head off.
He must be crazy.
RAOUL: You are being illegally held
in violation of international law.
Come forward.
Sergeant, I'll thank you to assist me
so we can accomplish this
in an orderly manner.
This has all been cleared
with Colonel Eichmann.
He must be crazy.
You, sir, I know I issued you a pass.
Please go to the car.
MAN 1:
Thank you.
Raoul, come down.
You've got three seconds
to climb down, mister.
Or I'm going to blow your head off.
MAN 2:
No. No, don't shoot.
No, don't shoot!
You are to be released immediately to
the custody of the Swedish Legation.
MAN 3: He must be crazy.
- Get down, damn it!
Get back to work.
- I have a pass.
- Let me through.
You, sir, I know you have a pass.
I signed it myself.
- Get back.
RAOUL: And you, young lady.
Yes, I saw you at the legation.
Go to Mr. Anger.
Stay where you are.
Release her.
She is to follow us to the legation.
Go to Mr. Anger.
Me, Fisher. I have a pass.
Good, then you're going back
to Budapest.
- Grab him.
- I'm on the list.
Don't let me lose you.
The rest of you, get back to work.
- All of you are strong...
- Come down.
Get down.
Get down.
Sergeant.
You will answer personally
to the International Red Cross
and the Swedish-German Friendship
Society, if he dares touch me again.
MAN 4:
Nobody touch him.
MAN 5:
Sergeant, what do I do now?
- Leave him alone.
- Thank you, sergeant.
Now, if I may proceed.
All those with documents,
come forward.
Come forward with your documents.
It does not matter if you've lost them
or misplaced them, we have a record.
Yes, sir, they took your pass, eh?
- Yes, yes.
- Per.
Yes, you're in the book,
Gasner Abram.
- Go ahead.
- Come, tell me your name.
You, I know you, sir.
May I see your pass, please?
- I lost it.
- Go ahead.
Let me see your documents, please.
Yes, there it is. There's your pass.
My tax receipt?
You think those animals can read?
Go on, he has a pass. Good.
The oldest will go in the car,
the others will follow on behind.
Sergeant, I shall commend you
to your superiors.
Thank you, gentlemen.
- Who is he?
- You didn't ask for his papers.
He has a Swedish flag on his car,
hasn't he?
As soon as Mr. Langfelder
has turned the car around,
we'll follow him back to Budapest.
It will be a long walk.
But after that,
we'll find a place for all of you
in one of our safe houses.
And perhaps a cup of hot soup.
Come along.
- Thank you all, for your cooperation.
WOMAN: I don't believe it.
Sergeant.
What do you want?
Would you leave us alone
with a few of those Jews?
Just for a minute.
Yeah.
I need a schnapps.
SOLDIER:
You. You with the beard.
- We haven't finished work.
- Behind the bunkers.
- Move.
- Move.
You, over there.
Per, drop back and make sure
they stay close together.
Yeah.
WOMAN:
No! Please! No!
Keep walking. Keep walking.
"Times are extraordinarily exciting.
The main thing is that we are working
and fighting successfully
to preserve the gift of life,
as you like to call it.
I'm gaining a truer sense of that gift
in helping to save others here.
And so you must think of me
as one of the most fortunate of men.
It is not given to many
to live such a life.
I hope that you are well,
and I promise with all my heart
that next time you will get
a much fuller report.
I shall close now.
I greet and I kiss you all, Raoul."
I must say, he seems
to have found himself this time.
Yeah, I agree.
Then why the long face?
According to Kalman Lauer,
conditions are worse than ever there.
Raoul has become
something of a hero.
And what is conceivably wrong
with that?
Heroes have been known to die,
Jacob.
That's what's wrong.
RAOUL: Every hour matters,
lives are in the balance,
or I would never have allowed a third
party to intrude upon this meeting.
With or without Monsignor Rotha,
you are welcome in my house,
Mr. Wallenberg.
- Call me Raoul.
- Then it's Lisl.
Tell me if I'm wrong,
but that day in the flower market,
I sensed you eagerly reaching out
to know, to help.
And now the situation is so critical,
baroness...
Lisl.
- That I couldn't resist coming to you.
You can't possibly imagine
Gabor is at all like Eichmann.
I don't know your husband,
but I do know the party he represents.
LISL:
He's his own person.
He could never destroy
innocent lives.
Then let's put it to the test
while we help shape his policies.
That is where you expect
to make use of me?
By allowing your passions,
your attitudes to shape mine.
They are already your attitudes, Lisl.
I will not be disloyal to him.
I'm asking you to keep him alive.
Because unless he can turn
his new power
to save lives and not crush them,
he will be tried when the war ends,
and executed.
- Oh, my God.
- The point is that need not happen.
There is still time for him
to disassociate himself
from this government of madmen.
I am bearing his child.
Then you must. Help him.
My child will be fatherless.
Not if you act.
He has great influence.
The only aristocrat in a den of failed
shopkeepers and cashiered officers.
Szálasi is a convicted murderer.
Your husband must prevail upon him
to honor the passes.
To ease restrictions on the Jews.
To refuse to cooperate with the Nazis.
And to stop the Arrow Cross
from murdering.
SOLDIER:
Show them the work order.
You're from Ferenczy's headquarters.
The detail is being moved.
Then march them off
to the safe house.
MAN: Come on, over there.
You heard him.
Come on.
- What if they don't believe me?
- So they'll shoot you.
Go on.
MAN:
You, take that over there.
Yes, you, go on.
Put it down there.
Faster.
You want your cabbage soup, huh?
Work then.
I have orders to take
all these workers to Buda.
- Wait a moment.
- Orders.
- Let me see your papers.
- I have papers.
- Go on.
- Ferenczy, from headquarters.
All right. On your way.
Up on the road,
you're going to Buda.
You. You. Over there, you.
You gotta shoot them in the pants
to get work out of them.
- Come on.
- Ha, ha.
- All right, keep working.
- You, Fodor, with them?
I'm not with them.
So?
I'm with the resistance.
Please be quiet
until we get to the house.
You, the worst student I ever had.
You were smarter.
We are scholars.
You perform a blessing saving us.
I save anyone I can,
including myself.
You saw them drown our people
in the Danube,
shoot them in the back,
kill the little Jewish children.
- I saw.
- So how can you still believe in God?
- How can you still believe in man?
- You didn't answer my question.
It is beneath me
to discuss the Talmud with a tramp.
Some scholars.
Perhaps you would prefer to discuss
the Talmud with the fascists.
Where was your Talmud
when they shot the little children?
Fodor, what you believe
and what I believe are different things.
This is what I believe in,
and it is all that they believe in.
Move on.
Gabor,
should we go to the shelter?
Hmm?
It's getting closer.
We can hold Budapest.
We and the Germans, of course.
That's not what I hear.
I swear on the cross
of the crown of St. István
that no Bolshevik will ever set foot
in our city.
Wallenberg says
the Russians will be in Budapest
- within two weeks.
- And what does he know?
He's far too busy
pulling Jews off trains.
He knows a great deal.
You've seen him?
He was here today.
I invited him and the nuncio.
I knew that.
Your priest playing the procurer,
was he?
Gabor,
Señor Rotha is our spiritual advisor.
And the pope is our spiritual leader,
and he seems quite disinterested
in Rotha's compassion
for our enemies.
Rotha has compassion
for you as well, Gabor.
So has Mr. Wallenberg.
And how does the Swede
show his compassion?
Does he hold your hand?
Does he whisper sweet endearments
in your ear?
We talked about you.
Why didn't he come directly to me?
He's cautious.
He wanted me to hear him first.
Ah.
A bit of intrigue, yeah. I like that.
- What did he say?
- Gabor.
It would make me so happy
if you could help him.
Help him?
Who gives a damn about him
or his Jews?
I am thinking of Hungary's future.
Isn't the goodwill of neutral nations
part of Hungary's future?
Szálasi might like the idea.
Isn't he greedy for Swedish approval?
So all that clever teaching
of the nuns,
they made you a first-class diplomat.
No. No, no, Gabor,
this is not about diplomacy.
Stay together.
Move quickly and be brave.
- And follow Mr. Wallenberg.
- Come on. Hurry, hurry.
We'll all be better off
in the basement.
- What was that?
- Come on, come on, come on.
RAOUL:
Come along now, come along.
Quickly.
- Is Josef all right?
- Come on.
- Oh, yes, just a childish secret.
- What, about me?
He saw your reaction
to that explosion.
Reaction?
And thought you carried it off
beautifully.
The little devil.
Why wasn't he laughing out loud?
I think he forgot how.
Come on, come on, come
You all right?
- Okay?
- Raoul?
RAOUL: Yeah?
- Since the Germans are the first
into the shelters, why don't we unload
the beds while the streets are clear?
- But the explosions?
- We'll do it during the loss.
Is everyone still with us?
Present and accounted for.
Children, any of you hurt?
Raoul is taking care of them.
I think they're taking care of me.
Their poor little lamb, huh? Ha.
Do I hear a cow?
Where are the rest
of my barnyard animals, huh?
Do I hear some chickens?
Some cats, huh?
Dog?
Dog?
But when I added
Wallenberg's Swedish condition
that we must refuse to cooperate
with Eichmann's deportations,
Szálasi squirmed
and Ferenczy roared with laughter.
But you made the first step.
And they know you are right.
They know it.
So tonight at the cabinet meeting,
you must be strong.
I will not be going
to the cabinet meeting.
But you must.
- You are the foreign minister.
- I will not be pushed, Lisl.
Anyway, they treat me as a child,
the baby of the cabinet.
Not old enough
to be taken seriously.
- No, I will not be humiliated.
- Gabor.
You told me yourself,
if the cabinet decides tonight
against the protection passes,
tomorrow is the beginning
of the end.
- The Jews will be finished off...
- The Jews.
...once and for all.
- The Jews.
The Jews. The Jews.
The Jews!
Haven't I told them for years,
"Shave off your beards, cut your hair.
Don't be so stupid and stubborn
in your ways.
You'll only bring trouble
on yourselves"?
Gabor!
I do not want to bring our child
into a world
where human life
is not worth fighting for.
Lisl, my adorable wife,
you know I would do anything for you
and our baby, anything.
- But I will not...
- Then you will go.
And make them see
what they must do.
MAN :
SZÁLASl:
the Hungarian cabinet has voted
with me to observe and support
Bloody Swede.
His protected Jews.
What the hell has got into Szálasi?
Keep moving. Fifty thousand,
and 50,000 more until it's over.
SZÁLASl:
- How do you explain that?
- We, uh, have a good fairy, Per.
Should I beware of Swedes
bearing gifts?
RAOUL: Consider the gifts
to mark a happy event.
A happy event?
I'm told Himmler has ordered a halt
to the gassings.
- Please.
- Oh, thank you.
And what else has your intelligence
bought you?
Or are your American benefactors
supplying that as well?
What a charming thought.
Cigarette?
- No, I don't.
- Thank you.
No, this item's
from your own department.
Auschwitz is to be dismantled.
And this all clearly pleases you?
After how many dead? Four million?
Five? Six?
It's quite an achievement,
eh, Wallenberg?
Himmler seems to be having second
thoughts about this achievement.
It appears
he's now trying to save his neck.
Himmler? Ha, ha.
You want me to believe you're not
interested in saving your own neck?
Oh, what you believe
is of little interest to me.
Really, Eichmann?
What does excite you?
Let me tell you what it is.
The desire to excel.
To go to my grave knowing
that no one has done more than I
towards ridding Europe of its Jews.
To accomplish this with distinction.
To prove myself worthy.
Oh, a worthy soldier,
that would be a change.
Thus far, your career has been mostly...
Uh, what shall I say? Technical.
Administrative.
Moving trains,
never quite filling quotas.
You conniving dilettante.
You tricked the Hungarians
into honoring those ersatz documents
for a while.
Now you're making a stink
about the marches.
Don't be encouraged
by your little moment of triumph.
I have already got that ass, Szálasi,
to countermand his broadcast order.
There is still time
to cancel the march, colonel.
- And since Himmler himself...
- Himmler be damned.
I'll decide the fate
of Hungarian Jews.
Starve them, beat them, shoot them.
March them into mass graves,
I know all about you.
You get your money
from the Americans,
from that cripple, Roosevelt.
Furthermore,
we know your secret as well.
You're a Jew yourself, Wallenberg.
Eichmann, you disappoint me,
given your reputation for exactitude.
The fact is my great-great-grandfather
was a Jew,
which makes me
one-sixteenth Jewish,
and not as much
as I would have preferred.
And now, may I make a suggestion?
Please.
Let's open your Scotch. I'm thirsty.
Shall we drink to...?
To honor. To duty.
Can you still feel secure, colonel,
in continuing to carry out your orders
to murder helpless civilians?
They give me orders.
"Get them to the camps."
Well, by God, I'll do it.
And I'll keep on doing it until...
Until Valhalla crashes down
around your head.
Not the twilight of the gods
but the death of monsters.
Shall we drink
to the death of monsters, Eichmann?
Get out of here, Wallenberg.
Your charm wears thin.
I cannot consider this conversation
as private. The Vatican and...
To hell with them!
Wallenberg.
I'll do you a favor.
I'm open to offers.
I'll find a train for your Hebrews.
For 750,000 francs,
made payable to me personally,
you can take a few hundred Jews
anywhere you want.
- And the others?
- They remain.
I'll consider it. Good day, colonel.
- Thank you, major.
- Wallenberg.
I want that Jew lover dead
before the day ends.
Sonja.
- Sonja?
- I'm really quite all right.
Well, the doctor's
coming right away.
You won't be riding that bicycle
of yours for a few days.
- I don't know. Why not?
- Are you sure you're all right?
Colonel Eichmann, please.
No, I'll, uh... I'll need it
until Vilmos gets us a new car.
I really think she should go
to a hospital.
Colonel Eichmann,
your driver did an excellent job
on my car.
-
- Not in the car.
RAOUL:
Dieter.
Dieter!
- What do you want, colonel?
- I'll tell you what I want.
I want you
to start marching the Jews.
And you can march them
until they drop.
This time, I will tolerate no delay.
- Come out, everybody.
- Come out. Come down, please.
Everybody get dressed.
One warm coat, one pair of shoes
and one valise.
No one is exempt.
Don't be frightened. You are being
loaned to our German ally for work
on behalf of Hungary,
by order of Prime Minister Szálasi.
You must obey.
- Come on.
- Mama, I have school.
- Josi.
- Come down.
- Hello? Hello, operator?
MAN 1: Come down.
Operator, I need 789-0...
Operator? Oper...?
MAN 1: Come down
and don't be frightened. Come on.
Put on your coat, Josi.
MAN 1:
Move it. Get down here now.
Will you call my teacher?
What?
What?
Will you call my teacher?
MAN 2:
Come out, please.
MAN 1:
You have no right to do this.
I am a Hungarian citizen.
You have no right.
Please, we must have everything.
- Quickly, or we'll be here all day.
- That belonged to my mother. No.
MAN 2: Watches, eye glasses, jewelry.
- That belonged to my grandmother.
MAN 2:
Everything you have.
You don't need to be so rude.
They're taking these.
It's for the best.
- What are we going to do?
MAN 3: Have you no mercy?
- I need... I need them to see.
MAN 4: Where are we going?
- My glasses.
- Hey.
MAN 5: We have Swedish papers.
- Aha.
MAN 5:
You are not allowed to do this.
WOMAN:
These belong to my mother. Oh, no.
What's the matter, you don't like it?
Get on with it.
- Papa, when will we come back?
- I don't know.
- Move, move!
FODOR: Hannah.
- I'm going to get her.
MAN: No.
They're taking her away.
- I said, no.
- Why?
MAN: This is Eichmann's work.
None of that Hungarian sloppiness.
- They're going to clear the city out.
- Come on, a walk will do you good.
That's the Swedish flag.
Let them blow
their Jewish noses in it.
Follow them.
Get word to me where they're headed.
- Where are you going?
- Wallenberg.
He needs to see me.
Well, why bother?
I thought he was just another goy.
Illmosh, you won't believe
what I found.
Fresh carrots, fresh onions,
fresh potatoes.
Ha, fantastic.
Brother Holin, it's nice to see you.
Welcome to our restaurant.
I hope you're enjoying your food.
Yes. Good.
There's plenty for all, don't worry.
SS round-up.
Go to the house on Bencher Street,
number 47, basement.
Good. Good. Eat. Eat all you like.
There's plenty. Always plenty.
SS round-up. Bencher Street,
number 47, basement. Good.
MAN:
Wallenberg?
Somebody told me
you wanted to talk.
Who are you?
You tell me.
Szcepakec Bronislaw.
Birthplace: Kraków.
In Budapest as registered alien.
Religion: Catholic.
Perfectly acceptable.
As you can see,
we're also feeding the sisters.
I'm not here to eat.
I'm Teicholz. This is all lies.
Except the part
about my being Polish.
Teicholz. You're with the Walde.
I hear you're good,
but, uh, difficult.
Did you get your head busted
fighting with the partisans in Poland?
Did you have to come to this country
illegally like me?
I'm impressed.
That's why I sought you out.
Why should I do anything for you?
- Walde's doing fine by itself.
- Indeed it is.
But we are overlapping
in certain areas,
with your printing business,
in particular.
Who in hell are you
to complain about our passes?
Do you know how many lives
we've saved with them?
Hundreds. Nevertheless,
you and I are beginning to overlap.
It's causing problems
for people carrying our passes
- and we're saving thousands.
- That's your claim.
That's the truth.
So redirect your hostility,
if you would, toward the enemy.
I'm on your side.
What do you want from me,
Wallenberg? Not that I'm delivering.
I want access to the Walde's
underground bunkers, Mr. Teicholz.
And you damn well better deliver,
because if you don't,
every one of these people
will be rounded up,
with the rest of the Jews
in Budapest,
and sent off on a death march
that will have no survivors.
I'll tell you what,
I got room for about 300.
A thousand and make room.
I'll make room.
Shake hands.
Fifteen hundred.
Hmm.
Keep up there.
Move ahead.
WOMAN :
- Keep moving.
-
MAN:
Keep moving.
WOMAN:
- Women there.
- Come on. Move.
Please, I'm an employee
of the Swedish Legation.
I must call my office.
Mama, I'm late for school.
MAN:
Move. Move.
Mr. Langfelder, who drove you here,
will be waiting for you on the street.
How can I thank you
and Mr. Wallenberg?
There's no need, madam.
- Good night and good luck.
- Good night.
Per?
- Yeah?
- Tell me something.
Do you ever miss those carefree
Scandinavian days?
Yes.
I don't.
Isn't it curious?
They're all a blur to me.
Full of contentment,
but it's as if they never touched me.
Perhaps nothing ever did before,
Raoul.
You found yourself here.
I'm sorry,
but I must not allow your obsession
to ruin what's left of my marriage.
It's 1:00 in the morning,
you needn't apologize for leaving.
Well, you have that sort of effect
on people.
My secret weapon.
We hit rock bottom today, Per.
- Yes.
- Marches again.
My God.
What are we coming to?
Get some sleep.
Welcome to my sitting room.
Thank you.
I'm sure Mr. Anger imagines
all kinds of things,
seeing me here at this hour.
I promise to disabuse him
in the morning.
I came to tell you
that your life is in danger.
I know that.
Not only from Eichmann,
Szálasi also.
And I wanted you to know
that Gabor tried to stop the marches
from starting again.
Then you came here
to feed your husband's case?
You are a neutral witness.
You might be asked to testify.
But you could've told me that
on the phone.
Yes, but the climate is worsening,
as you predicted,
and I wanted to be sure
that I saw you again
to tell you these things directly.
What things, Lisl?
- That Gabor is not an evil man.
- Simply misguided.
I am still carrying our child.
I don't need reminding.
- I was not admonishing you.
- Then what?
What other things, Lisl?
I am here...
...because it was impossible for me
not to be here.
You...
...are the most beautiful woman
I have ever known.
And if I take one step towards you,
I will forget why I came here
in the first place.
I must leave.
Leave?
Is this not the safest place?
But the warmest.
Monsignor Rotha told me something
this afternoon
that moved me very deeply.
He said the Nazis' greatest victory
was convincing the Jews
that they were doomed,
but that you changed that
for thousands of them.
What does a clergyman know
about the real world?
Learn to accept a compliment,
Raoul,
when it is given with love.
WOMAN :
I am hungry, Mama.
Josi, they'll feed us soon.
MAN:
We said it could never happen to us.
We were Hungarians
and proud of our country.
The people wouldn't let it happen.
Maybe the work camp
won't be so bad, Papa.
Oh, yes, the work camp.
WOMAN :
- Open the gates.
-
- That's it, hurry up there.
- Open.
WOMAN:
All right, Jews. Come on.
- Get moving.
- Up on your feet.
- Get up. Come on, up. Up.
- Get moving.
- Come on.
- On your feet.
Up on your feet.
MAN:
Who are you?
Fodor, Special Intelligence.
From Czepo.
I was sent here.
I never seen you before.
- On your feet! That's right.
- Can you hear me?
You want to stay here?
Get up.
- Keep moving.
- You must move, you must move.
Come, we're going for a walk.
That's right.
Mama, if I miss school,
will the teacher be angry?
Of course not, sweetheart.
We're only going a short way.
Why you cry, Mama?
I am tired.
- Will Mr. Wallenberg come?
MAN: You must obey orders.
Yes, my little one. He'll come.
- He'll come.
- Keep in line.
Up. Up.
- Mind the line there. Move on.
- Let's go.
Come on. Grab your bag,
join the line.
- Just a short walk from here.
- Come.
Hannah, you must promise me
when this is over, your music first.
You have talent.
- Don't stop, just move.
- Come on, don't waste time.
Come along.
Move faster.
Those at the front, move faster.
Watch the line.
Nobody moves out of the line.
I'm going to drag you out.
I won't go without my father.
- You, I knew you were no good.
- Papa.
- You see, Hannah, I warned you.
- He's not with them.
- Listen, we can run. He can't.
- You're crazy.
- You're going with me.
MORITZ: Hannah.
Hannah, don't leave me.
HANNAH:
Papa. I'll kill him.
They'll kill us if we don't run.
MAN:
After him!
- Who are you?
- Intelligence. I got, uh, ID card.
Stay quiet.
Keep still, you. Keep still.
German.
Go to the house on Petri Street,
you know it?
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Sir. Sir. They've cleaned out
four buildings in Buda.
- What?
- One of ours, one of the Swiss.
They won't exempt anyone.
And Teicholz said to tell you
that the march has begun
and they have trains waiting
at Hegyeshalom.
To take the Jews across the border.
It's happening. Death march.
Sonja's building's empty.
She and the boy are gone.
What? Police or SS?
- I didn't ask.
- Didn't they respect our flags?
- Apparently not.
- Damn them!
Once they get the Jews
out of Hungary, they're doomed.
At least here,
I have some bargaining power.
With the Russians, you mean?
Well, so long as I can threaten
these savages with the Red Army,
we have a chance.
Like all murderers, they're cowards.
Lutz? Wallenberg.
Do you have the report also?
Yes, tens of thousands of them.
Sick, dying, starving.
Yes, a massive rescue operation.
Trucks, food, clothes, medicine.
- Stop complaining.
- Come on.
Faster. There's a road ahead.
Good God.
Come on. Move, move, move.
- Move.
- Go on.
- Go, go, go.
- Come on.
Get moving.
You don't need to hit.
Don't need to hit.
Stay away. I can't...
- Don't.
- Come on.
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.
- Come on. Get up.
- I'm up.
Get away from there.
Shall I stop, sir?
WOMAN:
Mr. Wallenberg. Mr. Wallenberg.
No.
We can try to stop this
only at the trains.
WOMAN: Please, help me.
- Drive on to the station.
Mr. Wallenberg, please help me.
CROWD:
Help us. Save us.
Per,
what does our Christian faith
tell us about these Nazi scoundrels?
Who are they? What shaped them?
I am no theologian.
CROWD: Please, Mr. Wallenberg.
Save us. Help us.
Perhaps we are witnessing
the death of God himself.
CROWD:
Please.
Move! Move!
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Train is ready for you.
Let's go.
Keep that line tight.
Move.
MAN:
Watch out where you're going.
Go on, we're going up ahead now.
Move it.
Don't fall behind.
- Come on, Jews.
- Come on.
Get away from that car.
Keep away from there.
Off the road. Off the road.
Let the car through.
Get away from the car.
The main thing is statistics.
Too many died after they got here
before we could load them.
DIETER: You, you have to take back
the pregnant women and the sick.
- My orders are otherwise, major.
MAN: Up, up, up. On your feet.
I want live bodies on the train.
- You, on the train.
SOLDIER: We're arguing whether Jews
should die on the train or on the road
to Budapest, what's the difference?
The useless ones don't go.
- Look at him.
- You heard what I said!
DIETER: Shoot them or hang them,
for all I care. The sick ones don't go.
I'll kill you all with my bare hands!
Come on, you too.
You with the beard.
Perhaps we call Budapest, I'll get
a clarification from Minister Biner.
DIETER:
You do that.
How did we end up on the same side
with all the garbage of Europe?
Statistics.
Where is Teicholz?
- No, please. Please.
- Get on the train!
Out of the way.
Come on, move. Move. Come on.
Move forward.
Come on, on your feet.
Never mind all that.
Come on, move forward.
What are you doing?
Nobody touch the medicine.
It's not for you.
- Get away from here.
- Get back.
- Step back!
- Get out of here. Get away.
Step back or I'll shoot you.
RAOUL: Ferenczy.
PER: What are you going to do?
I'm not sure. Vilmos.
Get me some whiskey, cigarettes
and big packets of money.
You want me with you?
No. You and Charles do everything
you can to stop the trains from leaving.
And write down the names
of people without passes.
Fill in the blanks
for the young and strong ones.
Wait for me, huh?
- Colonel Ferenczy.
- Oh, the Swedes.
What a nice reunion, colonel.
Christmas is upon us.
I thought we might celebrate early.
Celebrate?
To warm the hearts
of your splendid policemen, huh?
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
So this fellow, this foreign office chap,
he asks,
"How can Hungarian Jews
becomes Swedes overnight?"
And I said, "Didn't you know,
the Swedes are the lost tribe of Israel?
These Jews are going home."
Going home? That's a good one.
- Stockholm, the new Jerusalem, huh?
- Yes. Yes.
I said, "It's been proven, by measuring
skulls and matching fingerprints,
the Swedes are descended
from King David.
The Royal House of Sweden
has Jewish roots.
Our constitution is based
on the Ten Commandments."
And now for the real Christmas,
huh?
Dollars? American dollars?
What do you want from us?
You know what I want, colonel.
You all know what I want.
MAN:
Come on, move it.
Please, please.
Let me help with the boy.
- You come with me.
- Leave this to me.
- I've got my orders.
- Leave the child alone.
Stop! There are people here
who are Swiss citizens.
Get them out of here!
There are many people here,
Swedish persons.
Close the doors.
Stop! Stop! Keep those doors open!
Stop!
Are there any
Swedish protected people here?
Take these.
If so, come forward at once.
You are in violation
of international law!
Let them get away with that?
Get those men out of here.
Take these. Pass them out.
- Those are ours.
- Stop!
- We have to move the train.
- Stay back.
I am the secretary
of the Swedish Legation.
If you have a pass or if you have
lost one, step forward at once.
Get off the trains at once.
Josef?
Mrs. Khan.
Mrs. Khan of the legation.
- Vilmos.
- I'll take her.
- Take her to the car.
- Let me have him. Come on, my boy.
Please. He is very ill.
- Get him down.
- Anyone with a pass, step forward.
Take your filthy hands off him.
Mr. Wallenberg is a diplomat.
Ferenczy, our agreement!
Stop. Leave him alone!
I have made an arrangement
with this man, sergeant.
- We have passes.
- Raise your hands.
- Raise your hands.
- What's a handful of yids to us?
RAOUL: Raise your hand
if you have a Swiss pass.
It does not matter if you have lost it.
You are here in the ledger.
You have the full protection
of the King of Sweden
and the Swiss Republic.
Oh, Mr. Schuarz,
I know you have a pass.
Mr. And Mrs. Yultz.
Yes, yes. I gave you passes myself.
I remember. Hurry.
What is your name?
Caroline Takie.
Yes, yes, yes.
Her name is in the book.
This Swede bribes you again,
eh, Ferenczy?
You'll get your share.
We'll give him 400 yids.
- He can't take all of them.
- Hurry.
- Rabbi. My friend Rabbi?
- Mandel.
- Rabbi Mandel. Yes, I know.
- Please, follow me. Please.
Yes, I know you have a pass.
You have sisters in Sweden.
Come on, Rabbi.
MAN:
We have our orders.
My family will be here.
My son, my daughter.
RAOUL: Yes, your children. Get up,
please. You are protected. Get up.
These are the Rabbi's children.
Release this man, at once.
Is there anyone else?
- Anyone else, raise your hands?
- Me.
- Speak up.
- We are... We are here.
Bring the children.
I'm sorry. I can take only so many,
so I must take the young.
- Forgive me.
- Forgive you?
I pity you.
- Get back in line.
- Yes, dear lady, pity me.
Close the car doors.
The train is about to leave.
- Ferenczy!
FERENCZY: Yes?
Ferenczy, open those doors.
- Open them.
- I can't do that.
We have food and medical supplies
on the truck. You will distribute them.
Per. Vilmos.
See that all our 400
are safely on the trucks.
WOMAN:
There is another car.
RAOUL:
Sonja, we'll find a doctor.
MAN 1:
How many will you take?
MAN 2: Get back on the train.
MAN 3: Come on.
MAN 2:
Get the people on. Close the doors.
Get out, Swede!
Go home, Swede!
Move the train.
- Close the doors.
MAN 4: Close the doors.
- Home before dark, as I promised.
WOMAN: We are most grateful, sir.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
You're safe now, Sonja.
You and Josef will be happier here
with my orphans.
And tonight,
we'll light the Hanukkah candles, huh?
Sonja?
Sonja.
Oh, no.
Oh, no. Give...
Give me the child.
Sonja, give me the boy.
Give him to me.
Sonja, give him to...
Very good.
Come down to your presents.
Come on.
LISL:
A Franz Josef suite.
Nothing is too good
for the wife of the foreign minister.
Now, if the Allies cooperate
by not bombing the rail lines,
we will be grateful.
The allies are not deporting me,
Gabor.
That is a minor interruption.
You will be rejoining me
before you know it.
Perhaps.
In the meantime,
at least I will be with my family.
You see to it they provide you
and our baby with every comfort.
I've enjoyed far too much comfort
while others have...
But you, Gabor...
No, no. Come now. No more of that.
MAN :
Goodbye, my beloved.
My little Lisl who will bear our child.
God bless you both.
Goodbye, Gabor.
Package from headquarters.
Raoul.
Roses in the winter.
It took some doing.
But the train is under way.
I'm an old hand
at bribing conductors.
Vilmos is waiting for me
at the next stop.
How clever you are.
Shall we drink to your safe
and pleasant journey? Hmm?
To your safe and pleasant life.
You've made it more than pleasant.
You've restored my faith,
along with a handful of others.
But mostly, Lisl,
it was you who helped me,
with the least to gain.
The least to gain?
Oh, no, Raoul.
I have been rewarded
beyond words.
Now I am abandoning you.
But what choice have you?
Szálasi would have had you arrested.
I should have made him do it.
I should have.
You would have.
I'm not bearing a child.
Oh, dear Raoul.
How difficult it is for you
to acknowledge what you have done.
What you continue to do.
Never enough. Never soon enough.
In matters of this kind, timing is all.
In all matters.
We're not doing so badly, are we?
Hmm? A vintage year.
A deep friendship.
Much more than friendship.
Yes.
Much, much more.
They said I was your spy.
My beloved spy.
Shall we ever meet again?
Wherever I am,
we will never stop meeting.
Here.
Well, colonel,
shall we retire to the library?
Please, come sit
where it's more comfortable.
Cigar?
Thank you.
Genuine Havana. And why not?
This is an occasion, huh?
Our last meeting.
Mm.
- You aristocrats do things properly.
- Ha, ha.
Dinner on bone china,
wine from Bohemian crystal,
Cuban cigars.
All that's lacking is en...
Entertainment.
Others have provided that, colonel.
Hmm?
Glorious display of fireworks
courtesy of the Red Army.
- Magnificent, isn't it?
- Mm-hm. Aren't you frightened?
- I'm a soldier.
- Out of uniform on the eve of battle.
Budapest could fall tomorrow,
colonel.
Shouldn't you be at the front
driving your troops?
It does not become a Swede
to mock me.
You see, Wallenberg,
I achieved my goal.
I cleaned Europe out, all but a handful.
Himmler couldn't do it.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He would sit with us over beer
and agree that the Jews
had to be finished off.
But that was with comrades over beer,
you know?
But to do it, to really do it,
that isn't easy.
Himmler. Ha, ha.
How many Jews are still alive
in Hungary?
In the countryside?
Not enough to fill a synagogue.
Budapest,
oh, 100,000.
Maybe 20,000 of them carrying those
damned papers you gave them.
So few.
So few.
And, colonel,
I ask you to spare them all.
Do you hear those guns?
The Red Army
is less than two kilometers away.
What can these few Jewish lives
mean to you now?
Be honest with yourself,
Wallenberg.
We Germans acted
on what others dreamed about.
Philosophers, churchmen, rulers.
The forbidden lust of Europe
to destroy the children of Abraham.
Colonel, your sense of history
is on the same level as your morality.
- I ask you again, spare these people.
- Ha, ha.
The world will thank us someday,
you mark my words.
Oh, there's your thanks.
There's your thanks.
You're doomed.
You and your whole pack, finished.
Oh, but it was a good road to travel.
Power. Wealth. Blooded horses.
The elite of Europe's whores.
Not bad for a modest salesman.
But you're an aristocrat,
you wouldn't understand.
When my time comes,
I'll go to the hangman smiling.
Colonel,
I will do everything in my power
to speed your journey.
You're certain the road is still open?
It is, sir.
The Russians have cut the others.
- You will drive me to Vienna.
- Yes, sir.
Wisleceny, orders are that all children
and protected Jews
are to be taken to the central ghetto.
No exceptions.
Once they're resettled in one place
they're going to be eliminated.
No single Jew
must come out of the ghetto alive.
I expect you to rise
to new heights, major,
in order to finish the job properly.
-  Hitler.
-  Hitler.
Help us here. That's right.
All right, this is the last one.
Okay.
- Come on.
- You don't do this to us.
Jewish pigs, get back.
- Close the door!
- Get back. Get back in there.
Put the bar in. Go on. Quick.
Nikki, those are chains.
They're locking us in.
No, the Russians are in the city.
They'll come in time.
Those are German tanks outside.
Why aren't they off fighting
the Russians?
Just listen. I'm going up higher
to get a good look.
The street rat will find
a safe nest for us yet.
- Come on, help me.
- Get us out of here.
No, change that, Sonja.
Say, "My dear Marshal Malinovsky,
I greet you on behalf
of the Swedish government
and extend my good wishes
to the Soviet Union.
I'm working on a plan for the
restoration of normal life in Budapest.
I put myself at your disposal,
and will happily meet
with your representative at..."
Sonja, you didn't have
to come to work.
The work is good for me.
We couldn't even bury him
in the Jewish cemetery.
The soldiers,
they wouldn't let us go there.
We had to break the frozen earth
in someone's yard.
- I'm sorry.
SONJA: A child.
Eight years old.
Who had he offended?
Sonja...
SONJA:
They won't feel sorry us, Raoul.
Ever.
They'll laugh at us.
Josi.
The Arrow Cross
and the SS are coming here.
They took everyone
from the other office.
Believe me, sir, we have to get out.
All right, everyone, another move.
Back with our orphans
on Venture Street.
We can hide out in those tunnels
under that old place for weeks.
All right, get moving.
Do we have any blank passes left?
- Yes.
RAOUL: Good. Well, take them.
Take some official seals and stamps,
uh, typewriters, files.
Oh, and, Vilmos,
see if you can find Teicholz.
Don't get yourself killed, but we need
a diversion in the center ghetto.
Sir.
RAOUL: Hello. Some new faces.
Welcome to our hotel.
And how are you?
Feeling better, huh? Good.
Where were we?
"I propose
we name this organization
the Wallenberg Institute
for Support and Reconstruction.
Its purpose, General Malinovsky,
would be humanitarian..."
Wallenberg! Mr. Wallenberg.
The savior of the Jews.
Excuse me, sir,
my staff and I are very busy.
Two days now, I have been guarding
your Jewish orphanage, Wallenberg.
I have to atone for my stupidity.
Captain, if you would
just go upstairs...
You are a wonderful man, Wallenberg.
I have been less than wonderful.
Dreadful, stupid. From now on,
you have a Hungarian bodyguard.
- Whether you know it or not.
MAN: Wallenberg!
Wallenberg.
Five hundred SS defense units...
Get off me, you bastard.
- It's all right. Tell me.
- Eichmann's orders before he left:
Shoot everyone.
They're moving in on central ghetto.
Tanks, machine guns.
- Surrounding your safe houses.
- Oh, my God.
I've got to find
General Schmidthuber.
Vilmos! Vilmos!
What did you see?
Some guys hanging around.
You can tell me.
I think...
- I think that they are going to...
- I know, my son.
I know.
Come, children,
time for afternoon prayers.
Get your books.
You too, Fodor.
The Lord doesn't give out marks.
I do.
Nikki, go on and pray with them.
What good will it do?
Maybe by tomorrow,
we won't be here.
But our book will remain.
God's word will last forever.
Come, children, we will sing now.
Nikki will join. Page 33.
MAN:
Stop him.
No, you can't come in here.
Royal Swedish Legation,
official business.
A strict order, all of these offices
were to be cleared out before noon.
The files must be burned.
We can allow for one day or two.
- Stop preparing a mass operation.
- General.
Oh, Wallenberg,
I heard you were killed.
General, are you aware
of the operation about to take place
in the ghettos?
- What's he talking about?
- Eichmann's orders.
- Well?
- The orders are
to machine-gun 100,000 people
to death.
Men, women, children, infants.
Do you understand this will be
your parting gift to humanity?
I wasn't aware of it.
I'm fighting the Russians.
General, there are companies from
your own division waiting to move in.
I ask you to stop it.
Not my division.
Yours?
It is true?
I'm told you are a combat officer,
hmm? A soldier, not a murderer.
I warn you, general,
if you allow this atrocity to take place,
I will personally see
you are tried as a war criminal.
- You threaten me, Wallenberg.
RAOUL: It is not an idle threat.
You will be seen by the world
not as a soldier,
but as a contemptible murderer.
To hell with him, general.
He's been bluffing.
He's been making trouble
for months.
General, you will hang for this!
Cancel it.
Call Operations and cancel it.
And you,
call off those Arrow Cross pips.
You have my personal guarantee
there will be no such action.
Thank you.
Eichmann is a madman,
but if we stop now,
- it's a confession of guilt.
- Silence.
Wallenberg.
Wallenberg.
Don't work too hard
at saving some necks.
- We have to move out.
- All right.
- Move out?
- All right.
Come on, men, we're moving out.
Pack up.
- Attention, everybody.
- All right, on the truck.
Everyone in the trucks.
Move out.
All you men, move on it.
Hannah.
Rabbi, they're going away.
I wish you'd change your mind.
The city isn't secure.
Nonsense, I've already made contact
with the Russians.
Look, Malinovsky has sent
an escort for me.
But the streets aren't safe,
they're still fighting.
Well, I have absolute faith in Vilmos.
Oh, Per, I've left some money
with the minister.
Please see that it's used to buy
food and medicine for the ghetto.
- I am. You can depend on us.
- I always have.
God bless you, Per.
And you.
Well, I'll back in a week, making my
usual impossible demands on you all.
Good luck, Mr. Wallenberg.
Meanwhile, Sonja will
keep you on your toes, huh?
Maybe Mr. Anger is right, sir.
Maybe you should wait.
Our new friends
don't look threatening.
Good morning, comrades.
Sonja.
- It's going well, huh?
- Yes.
I'm only sorry I, uh...
I didn't teach Josef to smile.
- Ready, comrades.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, bye-bye.
MAN: Bye.
Come on, let's get our people out!
Bring the bar.
Take that.
Move that one. Stand back.
Come out!
What's the matter,
you wanna stay in here?
Come on, you're free!
Is it possible, Vilmos,
that we did make a difference, huh?
WOMAN:
Mr. Wallenberg.
Mr. Wallenberg.
Captain.
I'm the second secretary
of the Swedish Legation.
I have an appointment
with Marshal Malinovsky at Debrecen.
Raoul.
What? What are they doing?
My name is Wallenberg,
here are my credentials.
The driver to the truck,
you are going with me.
I am in direct contact
with your commander.
Come, I have my own orders.
Please come.
RAOUL:
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
Do you realize
I have diplomatic immunity?
I demand an explanation.
Go!
