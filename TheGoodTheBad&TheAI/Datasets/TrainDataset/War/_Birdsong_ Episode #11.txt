Sync and Corrections by
Monsieur Wraysford,
we had almost given up on you.
Your train was late?
A little.
You're certainly not the last.
Let me introduce you
to Monsieur and Madame Berard...
Enchante.
Monsieur.
Isabelle, my wife...
Pardonnez-moi, Rene.
Who came all the way from England.
She, I suspect, only
from one of the more
fashionable shopping
parades in Amiens.
Enchante.
Gregoire, don't tease the dog,
please.
We have dinner?
Oui.
Bravo! Bravo!
Papa has such a beautiful voice!
An artist is nothing
without his patron.
Do you sing, Mr Wraysford?
Very badly. Pity. I have a particular
fondness for the patriotic song.
You'll be staying with us long,
Monsieur?
A month or more.
London is very keen
to see how these new machines work.
They can do in a single day what
and for one third of the cost.
Monsieur? How old are you?
Gregoire.
I'm 20. How old are you?
Ten.
Remember, Lisette,
we are speaking in English tonight
for the benefit of Mr Wraysford.
Madame?
Did I see you today
walking along the Rue Saint Leu?
I might have walked that way.
I passed that...
beautiful house
near les jardins d'eau.
There was someone playing piano.
I couldn't recognise the melody.
I just stood in the garden,
trying to stop myself
from walking right inside.
And did you?
Stop yourself?
It was one of those
sentimental folk songs, I bet.
I cannot bear them!
Musicians of today are now satisfied
with four notes
they can sell on the song sheet
on the street corner.
Give me one of our great composers.
Now, Camille Saint-Saens...
Now, there is a composer.
Rene, forgive me.
I cannot shake this headache.
Perhaps Monsieur Wraysford
can take my place at cards?
Of course.
And I had another little song
I was so looking forward to singing.
Another time?
Madame, Monsieur.
Good night.
Good night. Bonne nuit.
Poor Madame Azaire!
I hope she's not unwell?
My wife is of a nervous disposition.
Sir. Captain Weir's taken
two men underground.
How long have they been down there?
Six, seven hours, sir.
Who told Captain Weir
he could take two of my men?
Captain Gray, sir.
Tyson!
Tyson!
Cut off the air feed.
Turner's heard something.
The air feed's off.
For God's sake, Firebrace!
We're expiring down here.
I can't bloody breathe.
So shut up and save your breath,
Tipper.
Shell fire.
I heard wrong.
Just shell fire.
Get out!
Get out, get out! Get back!
Jack!
I want my men out now.
We want everyone out, sir.
I can't get you out, Turner.
Can't get you out.
Hurry up!
Keep going forward! Come on!
Look at me!
Keep looking at me, all right?
Look at me! Look at me, Turner.
Damn it, Weir! I will not allow you to
take my soldiers and put them in danger.
Christ's sake!
We're fighting this war, too!
Hurry up!
Tipper!
Breathe out sharp.
It makes it quicker.
Go on, go on!
Go on, go on!
Tipper! Tipper!
Tipper! Tipper!
Tipper?
You all right?
Turner.
Tipper!
Tipper!
For God's sake! Do you want to get us
all bloody killed?!
Don't you EVER let me see you
do that again.
Do you hear me?
Sir.
I will not have you endanger
the lives of the other men.
Get him to the MO.
Tyson, Shaw. Rest up.
Then I want you back down
to start to pump out.
Yes, Captain Weir. I'm on
sentry duty in an hour, sir.
Tunnelers don't do duty.
They're short of men.
Firebrace, take his watch.
Yes, Captain.
Water table must be too high.
It's all the rain.
So, how many men did you lose?
One.
Turner.
You talk to Gray. It was his idea.
I will.
Sir?
Did you order my men down
with Captain Weir, sir?
Weir? Captain Weir?
Yes. He's an engineer, isn't he?
Yes, and we're infantry, sir.
We're not claykickers. Those
claykickers are doing their bit.
You'll find you'll like them when they
blow Fritz sky high from underneath.
My men nearly drowned. Yes, I know.
Water table's up. There's nothing
we can do, unfortunately.
Sir, we are infantry.
We do not go underground.
Wraysford, they are laying mines
under Fritz's trenches.
If the Boche hear them, they will
dig down and break through.
They need protecting.
Try telling that to my
men when they're on a
shilling a day, sir.
Try leading by example
and go down with them.
Are you frightened, Lieutenant?
No, sir.
Refresh those sewer rats
in the basics of combat,
and then maybe I'll reconsider.
They may have been taught how to
hold a rifle,
but I'm not convinced
they'll be able to fire
it if the Boche break
through into our tunnels.
Yes. Yes.
Thank you, Riley.
Sir.
Rumour has it we'll get
some rest tomorrow.
Then who will keep
the French company?
I don't know what's worse ...
being underground,
or coming up and being under this.
You'd better get used to it.
Big guns take at least a week
to dig in.
They're not going anywhere now.
Aren't you going to open that?
It's been lying there all day.
Christ!
Mother has surpassed herself.
At least I GET post!
If only from my wretched mother.
I've never even seen you get
so much as a bar of chocolate.
Even the Red Cross send socks.
You ought to get yourself
a sweetheart, Lieutenant.
Riley! Bowl!
Are you lost, Monsieur Wraysford?
No, I'm...
Yes, I am.
I meant to turn left, but...
There IS a quicker route,
but then one would miss the roses.
Are you...
settling in well?
Quite well, thank you.
Sorry that you're joining us
at such a difficult time.
I fear the situation at the factory
will grow worse before it is better.
Gregoire is a fine boy.
Yes.
And Lisette, she's...
They're my stepchildren.
Rene's first wife
died eight years ago.
We married two years after.
I saw you today.
Near the Rue de la Gare.
There's very fine cafe there.
I know it well.
You were visiting a friend?
A friend? No.
I have very few of those.
'On the command, load, '
safety catches off,
and open the bolt.
I've forgotten how you hold it.
Like you hold your sweetheart.
Quiet!
Take the charger clip of five rounds
and place it in the breech.
Push the rounds firmly
into the magazine.
Open the bolt.
Close the bolt.
Safety catches on.
Check the safety catches, boys.
Good.
The weapon is now loaded.
Fire!
Miles away!
My finger's too fat for the trigger.
Hope you don't have that problem
anywhere else, Mr Shaw!
Don't hold it like you're
in a penny arcade.
Tuck it under your shoulder.
No, tuck it UNDER.
Tuck it in.
Fire!
Good man!
Not bad!
It's all muscle from
that hard digging we do
while you boys are nancying around
upstairs that does it!
Anytime you want to swap places,
mate? No, thanks.
At least we get some peace
down there. Unload.
Close the action,
safety catches on,
and rest your rifles.
Douglas, check the targets.
That's not much cop if that's all
we get to practise,
shooting at Fritz in the tunnels!
Suits me.
I came to dig, not hold a gun.
You'll do what I say if it's needed.
Sir.
He is a cold bastard.
He's a queer one, all right.
He's just trying to get through
this war, like the rest of us.
I'd rather him
than Florence back there.
Captain Weir's all right.
Jesus Christ!
Don't Fritz ever stop for tea?
Nor for breakfast, nor dinner.
Move out!
Douglas, look at me.
I'm here, Douglas.
Hold onto my arm.
Grip harder.
Harder, Douglas!
There you are.
Do you have a sweetheart, Douglas?
Morphine!
You do? What's her name?
Iris.
Iris.
I want you to think of her...
I want you to think of
the last time that you saw her,
and I want you to think
of the first things
you will say to her
when you see her again.
Think of her...
FOR GOD'S SAKE, MORPHINE!
Keep thinking of her. Keep thinking.
Keep gripping.
Keep thinking of her.
Keep gripping my arm.
Get him out of here.
Bad luck...
today.
This war provides daily lessons
in the extraordinary simplicity
of the human anatomy.
See this muscle here?
I never knew that there was
another one...
here, inside the sartorius.
Not until I saw it.
You're drunk.
Not nearly enough.
Who's she?
Someone I once knew.
Would you believe it if I said
I've never been with a woman?
Never?
How old are you, Weir?
Old enough.
The next village.
We don't want you to die curious.
Your family are close, Monsieur?
No. No, I have no family.
No parents?
No. No parents.
My...
My father before I was born,
and my mother when I was four.
Then you must have children,
Monsieur.
They are the greatest gift.
People say that.
Gregoire, how many is that now?
Five, but one is a fat one.
I promised him a centime
for each one that he caught.
Then you're more foolish
than I thought.
It's too hot.
It's beautiful.
Maman?
Do we know her, Stephen?
You mean Monsieur Wraysford, Lisette?
Gregoire, attention!
Gregoire, you will bankrupt me!
They're all asleep.
Yes.
Yet, all around, there's such decay.
I take bread to the workers.
That's where I was going when you
saw me in the Rue de la Place.
The children are starving.
My husband would not approve.
Madame, forgive me,
but I cannot stay silent.
At night, I hear you crying.
Maman!
Regardes, Maman,
ce que Papa a attrape.
Everyone!
Un souvenir, if you please.
Attention!
Un...
deux...
trois...
Perfect!
Were you asleep?
I don't know.
Yes, sir.
What's your name?
Firebrace.
Pick that up, Firebrace.
Some of my men think you tunnelers
don't work fast enough,
that you don't hear the noise
of the enemy,
so they're terrified of being
blown up from underneath.
And now they must escort you
underground
as well as fight a war above it.
And in return...
you fall asleep on your watch,
just 50 yards from
the German front line.
You know the punishment for falling
asleep on sentry duty, Firebrace?
Court-martial.
Sergeant Major Price
will bring you down in the morning.
Eyes skinned, Brennan.
Yes, sir.
Byrne, bail out some of this water
if you don't want your feet to rot.
Sir.
Smarten yourself up, lad.
Cap on straight.
Firebrace?
Is there something wrong?
Lieutenant Wraysford
asked to see me, sir.
He was asleep on sentry duty.
It's punishable by firing squad.
For Christ's sake, Lieutenant!
You can't be serious!
He's the best tunneler I've got.
Sit down, Firebrace. Have a drink.
No.
Thank you, Captain.
Sit down.
My son's not well.
My...
wife...
she says it's worse this week.
Diphtheria.
You turn it over in your mind.
Funny, you know.
Your head's here, but
your heart's always somewhere else.
Do you have children, sir?
No.
No, I don't.
I've not been sleeping properly...
I have two men on guard in
a shell hole in no man's land
for three days with
their feet rotting in their boots.
What happens if one of them
falls asleep?
Each one of them is someone's son.
Yes...
sir.
You a gambling man, Firebrace?
No, Sir. I don't believe in chance.
Tap that top card.
For Christ's sake, Lieutenant!
You don't have the authority
to have this man shot.
Seems like the man upstairs is
on your side today, Firebrace.
The ace...
power and stability.
No further charge.
You may go, Firebrace.
Yes, Captain.
I should fire every one of them
and let them go hungry.
One cannot deny progress, Monsieur.
When the world is demanding more and we
must supply them with what they need.
But they do not understand commerce.
One must be fearless,
if one is to survive.
Big order.
French military.
Jeanne?
This is my darling sister, Jeanne.
Jeanne. Enchante.
And this is Monsieur Wraysford,
our visitor from abroad.
- Monsieur! Monsieur!
- Raoul!
C'est pas tres convaincant?
Non, pas du tout.
Quoi! C'est pas bien?
Je prie pour ma belle soeur.
C'est mieux, quand meme, hein?
My sister was just reminding me
that as children we used to say
that I would open a shop in Paris
and she would live in the jungle
and be a missionary.
But only after your lover had
rejected you.
Maman!
What about you, Monsieur? What
did you imagine as a little boy?
The usual, I suspect.
And what was that?
A life of sorts.
No adventures at all?
Every child should wish
for adventure, Monsieur.
Lisette...
That's the way all the young ladies
are wearing it.
Do you not think it should be
a little higher, Monsieur?
Maybe a little higher?
Lisette.
Gregoire!
You bat. I'll bowl. D'accord.
You must think we are silly,
Monsieur.
But we see each other so little.
Then when we are together...
Not at all. She seems very happy
now that you are here.
No.
I don't think it is MY visit,
Monsieur Wraysford.
At last she has someone under 40
to keep her company.
You never married, Madame? No.
I resisted my father's
choice for me.
And Isabelle did not?
Be careful, Monsieur.
My sister is very dear,
but I am afraid you will be the one
who is hurt.
Merci beaucoup, merci.
Have you read it ... Freud?
No, sir.
Pity.
Captain Weir said you
wished to see me. Yes.
We are sure Fritz is going to
break through any day now,
but we need to keep laying charges.
I need you down with those
tunnellers.
It's not natural to be buried alive,
I know, but,
we need a regular rota
going down with them
if we are ever
to mobilize near Amiens...
Where, sir?
Amiens. In around six weeks.
Yes. You know it?
I spent a summer there
before the war.
I will not... I will not go down
that tunnel, sir.
I did what you asked, I went over
their basic training with them.
For God's sake, is
that not enough?
You're curious to me, Wraysford.
I've seen all that rubbish
in your dugout.
Your carved figures
and bits of candlestick.
You're quite superstitious.
Aren't we all? No. An officer
can't afford to be superstitious.
Our lives depend on strategy
and tactics,
not matchsticks or card games.
It passes the time.
You'll go down with them.
All right. Dismissed.
Armitage, Byrne and Tipper.
Here, give us that.
You do my watch tonight.
Cheers.
Oi, what about me?
Give over, will you?
Cigarettes out.
Wraysford, you joining us today?
It would seem so.
You keep that pump working.
Brennan, you go first.
Yes, sir.
There better be no crawling.
Just shut up, Byrne.
Fighting tunnel.
Fighting.
Listen ... we've heard Fritz just been,
so if they break free,
move back yourself.
We stick together
and talk only when I do.
Firebrace?
You sure this will hold?
It's not up to London Underground
standards, sir,
but I reckon you could run a train
through it good enough.
Brennan, you first, then Byrne.
I can't! I can't!
I can't!
No, sir.
I'm infantry.
I'm not supposed to be down here.
I'll take my chance in a trench,
but not in a bloody hole.
None of us signed
up for this, Byrne.
But if the sewer rats
can do it, so can you.
You will go down that tunnel.
Or I'll send you
on every patrol until
you've cut the wire
from here to Switzerland.
Back! Get back, back!
Sir. Sir.
Sir...
Sir?
You're leaving already? Yes.
I must leave on business.
I will not be back
until tomorrow.
I leave you in charge
of the factory, Monsieur..
Jeanne, are you ready? Oui.
Tell her, Rene. Tell her to stay.
I will not let you leave today.
Do not be silly,
your sister cannot visit for ever.
You are shaking. Have you a chill?
No.
Marches avec moi.
Au revoir.
I am so sleepy.
Merci.
A walk in the garden and then a
little nap, I think.
A walk is a good idea.
Do you want to go into town?
No, I think just a nap.
Wake me
if I am not up by five, please.
Excuse me.
We got him. We got him.
Get him out! Get him out!
Move!
Papa! Papa est arrive.
I can't look at you.
I am going to give myself away.
Rene.
All's well?
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
Nous avons des droits!
Nous avons des droits!
Nous avons des droits!
Nous avons des...
This malevolence has spread
to the other workers.
"Nous devons rester unis dans
ce combat ou nous tomberons tous."
We must stand together in this
matter or we will all fall.
Does she seem preoccupied to you?
My wife?
I am sorry. I'm sorry.
No, not at all.
But she doesn't. I'm sorry.
You're right, you're right.
You are very good for us,
Monsieur.
Morphine.
Morphine.
No, he's gone. Name, tag him
and lay him out.
No, no, a moment longer.
Rene will be home really soon.
No.
Is that terrible?
I don't know why, but no...
no, I don't believe it is.
Perhaps I should.
You must want more.
Than what?
Than...
Picnics...
and endless dinners,
the numbing hours with him.
Let us not talk of this, Stephen.
I could take care of you. Please!
So that he won't hurt you any more.
He doesn't mean to hurt me.
Then why does he do it?
He grows frustrated.
He can't...
for some reason, with me...
He is unable to.
My boy...
So serious.
Now that you are here,
he can't hurt me at all.
How does this fasten?
How does...? Is it...?
Mademoiselle.
The trees are too close together.
Or perhaps you are trying
to sketch Maman?
Isabelle.
Isabelle.
What do you mean? I have seen you
when you think we are all asleep.
Do you not want me?
Do you not want to do those things
to me?
She is not even my mother.
She need only say a word.
She won't.
Leave.
This is madness.
Did you want her?
She's a child.
Did you?
I want you.
Morning, beautiful.
Fancy a bit of that, Jack?
Too early for me.
Oi, I'm starving.
Put 'em away.
You're putting me off me eggs.
Who's the new brass?
Must be Wraysford's replacement.
Do you know where they put him?
Over with the rest of them.
Might be a brass but we're all
the same when we're dead.
Sir.
Lieutenant Cartwright.
He'll be taking over
from Lieutenant Wraysford.
Yes, sir.
Sir, has Lieutenant Wraysford
got a family?
I don't know...
I really don't know.
Someone should write
to his family, sir.
Send his badge.
Yes...
Would you like me to go, sir?
Say a prayer?
Yes, Firebrace.
That would be very...
kind. Yes, if you wouldn't mind.
Captain.
Get me a souvenir? Get it yourself.
You're going soft, Jack.
You'll miss breakfast. Save us some.
Another order in today.
The promise of five francs extra in
their pay and they just look at me.
Where's their sense
of national duty?!
We'll break the strikers yet.
The strangest thing, I heard today.
Someone has been taking
parcels of food to their families.
Well, they...
They do have some supporters, sir.
One or two sympathetic men.
No.
This is the oddest part.
It was a woman.
Apparently of some rank.
Now, isn't that the strangest thing?
The children were hungry.
I saw them going through
the dustbins in Saint-Leu.
Don't ask me to stop,
because I'll do it again.
Isabelle... Punish the men,
not their families.
Leave the room.
Lisette, I said leave the room.
It is all your fault. Lisette!
We were happy before you came.
Your father is right. Leave the room.
I discounted these rumours,
even though it was
your name attached to them.
Rene... Be quiet.
Monsieur, if you please, I would
like to be alone with my wife.
Sir? No.
Let him stay.
I want him to stay.
There was another piece of idle
talk. I chose to ignore it.
I'm so sorry...
I meant you no harm.
This boy...
This English boy!
In which room?
In my own house! Which room?
I pursued your wife, sir.
I seduced her.
You have never taken the
trouble to know me, Rene.
Forgive me Yes, I forgive you.
I forgive you any wrong
you have done me...
and I ask you to forgive
me for all the wrong I
have done to you.
You will leave my house, now.
You think you will be able
to keep her?
Isabelle. We must leave now, come.
J'enverrai quelqu'un pour prendre
le reste de mes affaires.
Wraysford...
Wraysford.
Maman!
Maman!
Maman!
Isabelle!
If you go with him,
you go to hell.
Help.
Help.
Get me up.
Isabelle.
I know that many of you
will be relieved
that we are going to attack.
How do we look?
Happy.
No, no let's raise a glass
to all those already forgotten.
You're as bad as Weir. Always trying to
get me underground with you sewer rats.
This is for
the next time we meet.
