AMAH:
Jamie!
FATHER:
Jamie, off the grass!
Off the grass!
Nice plane finish!
- Which side will win the war?
- Ours, of course.
- Oh, that war.
- Well, China isn't our war.
We're awfully lucky.
- Living here, having everything.
- Naughty!
The harder I work, the luckier we get.
I only meant lucky.
Luckier than him.
We're luckier than most.
He's luckier than some.
Out of the way.
Chip across the water.
The Japanese will win. They've got
better planes and braver pilots.
I may join the Japanese Air Force.
For heaven's sake!
Father, look! Zero Sen!
It's my plane! Zero Sen!
Amah, I'll have...
...the butter biscuits.
Mrs. Graham, she...
...not want you eat before bed.
You have to do what I say.
MAN :
Hello...
...Ace.
- I was dreaming about God.
- What did he say?
Nothing. He was playing tennis.
Perhaps that's where God is
all the time.
It's why you can't see him.
I don't know about God.
- Good night, Jamie.
- Perhaps he's our dream...
...and we're his.
Go to sleep. It's the Lockwoods'
party tomorrow.
Can I take my glider?
Dream of flying.
Mother...
...if God is above us, does it mean
up, like flying?
Good night.
- Mistress, very beautiful.
- Thank you, Amah. Off we go.
FATHER:
Behave yourself.
Thank you, Yang.
Squeeze up.
Mind the plane. Prop it against
the seat. Right, Yang.
Settle down, Sinbad!
Take the Wang Pu Road.
Let's avoid the crowds.
- See you back on board.
MAN 1: See you, Charlie.
MAN 2:
Green apples! Green apples!
No mama. No papa.
No whiskey soda.
FATHER:
Slow down. Checkpoint coming up.
Hello, darling.
Lovely to see you.
- Big kisses.
- There he is.
- Leave Shanghai while you can.
- They leave us alone.
Lockwood's invited a Chink.
Sorry, but don't mind him.
- English humor?
- Scottish whiskey.
Are our days numbered?
All our days are numbered.
Ours higher than yours.
You've been in Shanghai 100 years.
It's only an incident.
The Japanese, four years. Nothing.
Long enough to spoil your harvest
and steal what's left of it.
A million Chinese peasants are
trying to enter Shanghai.
The Japanese get hungry too.
We have the guns, the planes
and 500 million fighting back.
- We'll be here after every war.
- Here's to that.
I hope we'll be here too.
Always delighted to return
hospitality.
- Very good. Utterly convincing.
- Thank you.
Zero?
Nakajima. Two machine guns.
I rely on you for keeping up-to-date
on the war.
Especially military aviation.
- I hear you resigned from the Scouts.
- I'm now an atheist.
- Where are you going?
- To see something!
Oh.
Your boy tells me he's an atheist.
Always thought he was.
- Chow time.
- Thank you.
JIM:
Enemy aircraft sighted!
He's on my tail! On my tail!
FATHER:
Jamie!
Jamie!
Stand still, John.
Jamie.
Don't run.
FATHER: Come, you're
missing the party.
- I left my plane.
- Never mind.
- Don't look back.
- Thanks.
They're waiting for something
to happen.
- They didn't look angry.
- It's not anger. It's patience.
- Is it time to close ranks?
- Get Mary and the boy out.
Somewhere safe. Singapore?
We're moving into the hotel.
MOTHER: Why?
- To see how things are going.
I don't want you two alone
in the house.
Jamie?
I didn't mean it. It was a joke.
Keep away from the window.
Get dressed. Do what Mother
tells you. We're leaving.
I am dressed.
JIM: Am I going to school?
MOTHER: There's no school today.
We'll see if Yang can take us home.
FATHER:
Never mind the suitcase. Come on!
- Taxi! Over here! Taxi!
WOMAN 1: Excuse me!
FATHER:
Good heavens, this is ridiculous!
- Keep holding my hand!
MOTHER: Stop shoving me!
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Yang!
Quickly!
Yang, get us to the waterfront.
Jamie, for God's sake, sit down!
Jamie, get out of the car. Quickly!
- What will we do?
- Get out.
Perhaps there'll be a boat.
Sorry. Max was right.
Don't push me!
Mary!
Hold on to him!
John!
FATHER:
Stay together! Hang on to Jamie!
Jamie, don't let go!
JIM:
My plane!
Jamie!
Mum?
Mum?
Mum! Mummy!
Jamie!
Mummy! Mum! No!
Go home. I'll find you there! Go home!
Mummy!
Mother!
Mother!
Father!
What do you think you're doing?
Where's my mother and father?
Come on, man!
Come on, kid!
MAN:
Come on!
Wait! Wait!
MAN:
Come on!
Wait!
Please!
Excuse me, everyone.
I surrender.
"I surrender.
I surrender. I surrender."
BO Y:
No mama! No papa! No whiskey soda!
American boy?
- American boy?
- English.
English?
I'm waiting for my chauffeur.
English boy.
English boy, you come now.
Thank you.
You come now.
- You come now.
- No! No!
Hey!
English boy!
I surrender! I surrender. Please!
JIM:
Please, sir!
I surrender!
Excuse me, sir.
My name is James Graham. I'm British.
I'd like to surrender, please!
Please!
Please, I'm British.
I'd like to surrender.
Please, sir.
Please!
English boy!
I surrender!
Please!
Help me!
Help me! I'm British!
Help me!
- Help me!
BO Y: Stop running.
JIM:
Please! No! Please!
Help me! Help me!
MAN:
Hello.
Kid. Kid, you okay?
Kid, you all right?
I think so.
Where do you live?
I'm waiting for my parents.
They've been delayed.
Delayed?
Some kind of crazy British kid.
What's your name?
James Graham.
I'm writing a book on contract bridge.
Are you with the American fleet?
American fleet? It looks like
you almost lost your shirt.
Maybe I can help you find
your parents.
I know just the man.
JIM:
Do you know General Winter?
My father knows important people.
Do you know my father?
He owns a textile mill
on Szechwan Road.
Mr. Lockwood? He's with
the British Association.
Perhaps you don't know anyone.
How about Louis Charles and Michael
of the Avenue Foch gang?
Know about psychic bidding?
It's in my book.
Let's say you need three diamonds.
You just think three diamonds.
Then your partner,
when he gets four aces...
...he shouts and you put down the...
You put down your aces and then...
I can't remember it now.
Probably my parents are on a ship
to Hong Kong.
Then they'll send for me.
My father will give you a reward.
He gave a taxi driver $5
for bringing me home from Hankow.
Ever been to England?
FRANK: Kid, you're starting to get
on my nerves.
Look what I found under my truck.
I'm sorry already.
BASIE:
Come on in, boy.
FRANK:
He's either hungry or crazy.
BASIE:
You need to lie down?
My father has a cotton mill at...
...Pootung.
- He'll be ingratiated to you.
BASIE: Ingratiated is a fine word.
He once gave a taxi...
BASIE: In a minute.
Your tongue's running away.
That's a well-kept set of teeth.
Someone has paid a lot of bills
for that sweet mouth.
Frank, you'd be surprised how
people neglect their kids' teeth.
Basie, I got you three.
I wasn't able to sell
any goddamn portholes.
Those Hankow merchants...
...they're charging $ 10
for a bag of rice.
Cathedral School too.
FRANK:
Cathedral?
Is he a kind of priest?
The Cathedral School.
It's a school for taipans.
You must know some
important people, son.
What do they call you?
I once met Madame Sun Yat-Sen.
She didn't call me anything.
I was 3.
BASIE:
Madame Sun?
I was presented.
- Presented.
- You two keep getting presented.
We'll be up to our asses in junk,
eating rats when the Japs walk in.
The Japs are not looking for us.
Nantao Creek is full of cholera.
They've got more sense.
FRANK: It's a changed world.
Even if I sell this stuff...
...there wouldn't be enough to get
a sampan upriver.
We'd have to strip the
So we don't have any rice for you.
Let's leave the boy alone.
All these new words and now this.
Fancy candy?
- What did you say your name was?
- Jamie.
I'm building a man-flying kite...
...and writing a book
on contract bridge.
Jim. A new name for a new life.
BASIE: Jim's parents got
taken with the other Brits...
...and now Jim's looking for them.
Don't worry about Frank, he always
eats after me. Don't you, Frank?
I always eat after you, Basie.
Because I think for us both.
Jim, chew your food.
Chew every mouthful six times
to get the benefit.
Frank, we might do all right
in one of those camps.
Doesn't look like we'll
leave Shanghai soon.
You're a tired boy, Jim.
Where am I gonna sleep?
BASIE:
Shanghai Jim.
FRANK:
Find any gold teeth?
BASIE:
Buying and selling, Frank. You know.
Life.
BASIE:
Okay, sit. Sit.
Make a muscle.
JIM: Why can't he sell me?
FRANK: Nobody wants you.
You're worth nothing.
Skin and bone.
Pretty soon, you'll be sick
all the time.
Basie...
First, I could show you
some rich pickings.
Hundreds of houses left empty.
Is that right?
I'll show you the houses
I lived in before Frank found me.
They were luxuriant!
Luxuriant?
You had good sense being born there.
It was good living.
There certainly was good living!
There was opulence!
Opulence.
BASIE:
All right.
We'll go look at these houses.
Let's go, Frank.
Opulence.
That one has whiskey, gin
and a white piano.
JIM:
That one has whiskey, gin...
- Whiskey and a radiogram.
- What about the boarded one?
It has a mirrored dance floor,
radiogram, fountain...
...and crystal chandeliers.
- Crystal chandeliers?
- I think they were crystal.
- You're tired.
What about cash?
BASIE: What about money?
JIM: I did see money.
Piles of notes on the table.
I'm taking you there.
Turn right here.
I knew she'd come back.
FRANK:
Take it easy.
JIM:
Mother!
- Damn it, they're Japs.
- I see. Back out.
I can't back out! There's no reverse!
- Just go forward.
- Come on!
Jesus Christ, Frank.
BASIE:
I want these back when they're done.
Basie...
Basie.
Basie.
Basie.
Engine number two on fire.
On fire, come in.
Come in, Red Dog Leader.
Red Dog Leader, come in.
Adjusting propeller? Red Dog Leader.
Engine two on fire.
On fire, on fire, on fire...
It's just a little fever.
Don't worry. We've all had it.
Do you feel better now?
It's perfectly all right.
I can wash it.
Excuse me.
There's been a mistake.
It may have been my fault.
I'm terribly sorry.
MAN :
Have you forgotten the cutlery?
No, I haven't.
You can't drink water from here.
People are dying of dysentery.
But we can drink boiled water.
Boiled water?
Many thanks, Basie.
You're welcome, Jim.
You've got nice manners.
I appreciate that.
Now it's chow time.
Get in line.
Keep the ball in play,
first in line.
I think your father would agree.
Actually, he would agree.
After the war, you two
should play tennis.
I want you to get Mrs. Partridge's
potato while you're there.
I think she died, Basie.
She died, but didn't hand
in her dinner pail.
Okay, go. Go on. Hurry.
And, Ace, don't forget to bow
to the sergeant.
We gotta get out of here.
MAN 1: The camps are full. It's our
bad luck to be taken here.
MAN 2: The Japs haven't enough camps
for us all.
WOMAN:
This is disgusting. Get some water.
Come on, children.
She's with God now.
What are you doing, Basie?
Looks like your size, Jim.
I don't want her shoes.
JIM:
I don't want them.
- I don't want them.
- Somebody will.
Basie, leave her!
Fine! I don't want her shoes!
Stop it. Leave her. Leave her!
Stop it. I don't want her shoes!
Pipe down.
It's the lorry. The lorry!
Come on!
JIM: Come on.
- No!
Come on! Don't you see?
This place is to see who dies!
SOLDIER:
Healthy ones go. Sick stay.
Tell him who we are, then...
We don't say anything.
Just look him in the eye.
SOLDIER: Name?
- George Flynn.
SOLDIER: Name?
MAN 1: Summers.
Excuse me.
- I'm a doctor. Let me through.
WOMAN: That's not fair!
I'm a British citizen!
MAN 2:
You can't do this!
MAN 3:
No! I'm with them!
- Please!
- Please!
Paul. Your name Paul?
Get your sister to smile,
I'll show you a magic trick.
Don't leave me!
Take me with you, Basie!
Listen, Basie! Take me with you!
I can't stay here!
I'll work for you. I'll do anything!
Take me with you!
- Soochow.
- Soochow!
I've been there lots of times.
Straight in that direction!
Head straight in that direction.
My parents were members of the country
club. Straight that way.
I've lived here my whole life!
I know my way everywhere.
I can speak...
Soochow!
Here we go!
Soochow!
BASIE:
Nice pair of golf shoes.
A friend left them to me.
You wouldn't want
a watch, would you?
No. Sorry.
Now do you know where we are?
We're here, okay?
We have to turn left here.
We have to turn left, okay?
You do what I say or we'll never get
to Soochow.
And then you'll be shot.
I look after him for his daddy.
- You're American, are you?
- Definitely.
I worked underground
for the Kuomintang.
As a conjurer?
MAN: That must be the camp.
We'll live right by the airfield.
- I don't see a camp.
MAN: Over there. See?
Those huts at a distance.
What do I do with this?
They want us to carry stones!
Please, on the truck is
a sick old man. Please...
On the truck, there's an old man.
- No, no, no.
WOMAN: Please!
Papa! Papa!
RAWLINS:
I'm all right.
- Use your wedge!
- That boy, running wild!
Spends most of his time
at the 19th hole.
You'll be blackballed by
the country club, Jim.
WOMAN:
Hello, Jim.
That's a splendid cabbage. Thanks.
Now number seven for the sketch.
"Fare thee well: 'tis partly my
own fault which death or absence..."
MAN:
"Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse."
That's not fair!
Give us our marbles back.
Give us our marbles back!
At least one more chance.
MAN:
Mrs. Phillips!
Mrs. Gilmour!
Dr. Rawlins, I've got my homework.
RAWLINS:
Can you do this?
Now don't speed up.
Keep the rhythm.
She's gone, Dr. Rawlins.
She just looked at me. She looked
at me! I've done it!
I can bring her back to life!
Watch her eyes. I can do it again!
She thought she was dying in England.
Stop it, Jim!
You pumped some blood into her brain,
just for a moment.
Give the mosquito net to Mr. Radik.
Just give it to him.
You give the mosquito net
to whoever's dying next?
Future passive. "I shall be loved."
It's like
losing the war, dying.
"They were being loved."
Can I have his shoes
when he's dead?
You pragmatist.
- "You will have been loved."
We have to beat them.
- Who?
- The Japanese.
It's how we'll win, refusing to die.
- What happens when war ends?
- Do you want it to end?
If we stay in the camps,
the Japanese will look after us.
We're an embarrassment to them.
They can't feed us much longer.
They'll fight the Americans.
RAWLINS: You admire the Japanese?
JIM: They're brave.
- That's important?
- If you want to win a war.
We don't want them to win.
I know.
Remember, we're British.
Yes.
I've never been there.
Put that down.
Tomorrow, gerunds.
What about English?
Think of it as the antidote.
Learn it as a poem.
It's not just a string of words.
- Would you look at Mr. Radik?
- Yes, of course.
Those from the hospital garden?
I have to give Basie something...
Good thing you're friends.
He's a survivor.
Because he only drinks boiled water.
You'll wear yourself out looking
after everyone.
Keeps himself busy, doesn't he?
- The caterers are arriving.
- I'll be there!
Won't taste the same without you.
BO Y:
Wait for me!
MAN: What about mines?
- Get out.
MAN: Maybe the Japs put down mines.
- Hey, boss. Boss!
- Boss, it's the kid.
BASIE: Come in.
- Would you like a Hershey bar?
- Please!
So would I. Have you got one?
Stop breathing so much.
There ain't enough air.
There isn't enough air for you
in China.
- Here are your clothes.
- Better than the Shanghai laundry.
- Did you get a cork?
- I got one.
Good boy.
- That's fine.
- I've never seen that one. What year?
- '45.
- '45? How'd you get that?
I subscribe. It has Packard,
Studebaker, Jell-O. Things from home.
- Can you get me a sewing needle?
- I'll try.
- What's that?
- It's a trap.
