Mr. Rijckx?
Did you bring me Jan Ternauw?
Excellent, Mr. Rijckx!
The work of a beginner,
this Kassovic.
However, a strong composition,
concrete.
An excellent combination
of fear and suffering,
of passion and form.
So energetic!
I'll be very sorry to see you
leave my service, Mr. Rijckx.
- But,... you could also stay.
- No.
Why so attached to life,
Mr. Rijckx?
So little happiness,
so much pain...
I could... show you
the true beauty of death.
Two more, Mr. Rijckx.
Two more...
Explosion
Exhaustion

Sarah?
Daniel?
Death by old age?
Don't you know that these shadows
are almost never interesting.
It's a worthless composition.
I know that not all deaths
are masterpieces, but nevertheless...
I hope that your final project
will be more interesting.
The spontaneous aesthetics
of an accident, for example...
For example...
A train, a plane or a car...
An explosion...
Or a drowning...
We haven't had a drowning
in a long time.
Or a murder.
Murder is always expressive.
There we have it,... murder.

Fort van Chartreuse, Shot dead by...
I'll see you soon, Sarah.
Attention!
Line up!
Load!
Aim!
Fire!
My offer still stands,
Mr. Rijckx.
You can stay.
No.
You have lived 10,000 days.
You have given me 10,000 lives.
Your death is erased.
Mr. Rijckx...
The door to life will remain open
for exactly 1 hour.
You can go wherever
and whenever you want.
Choose wisely... because,
when the time has passed,
this door will be
closed to you forever.
I knew you'd come back.
No one wanted to believe me,
but I knew it.
Daniel?
Daniel?
Daniel?
Daniel?
- Sarah!
- Daniel?
My apologies, sir.
Ms. Winters is a bit confused.
Her Daniel... She was never able
to accept the awful truth.
And now, she thinks that
every soldier in uniform...
But dead soldiers do not return.
Right?
One life for another,
Mr. Rijckx.
When a shadow disappears,
another one has to stay.
The choice is yours.
She is waiting...
