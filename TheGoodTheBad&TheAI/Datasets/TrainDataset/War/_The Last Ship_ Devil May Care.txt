I and five members of my crew
are prisoners of war.
- You got it?
Yes, ma'am.
Master Chief, United States Navy.
Serial number 153511508.
Rivera: We can't video
conference with the ship.
Pirates are broadcasting at Hi-Def.
Can we trace the broadcast
back to its source?
Unlikely, sir.
They probably sent it out as a sky wave.
It works like a HAM radio signal.
She's right.
Anyone with rabbit ears
could be picking up the signal.
So we'll put out a statement
before the other stations
start rebroadcasting it.
You can get out in front of this.
Woman:
Wait, there's someone missing.
Who?
Mason.
Alisha: Maybe he got out somehow.
Negative. Green and my brother swept
the club before they escaped.
The pirates definitely took him.
My God.
Takehaya.
You have inhabited our lands
and our seas for far too long.
The plague has killed,
but you're killing more.
So, Jeffrey Michener,
you will hear my demands.
I have already executed
one of your sailors.

Based on the time
since the attack in Vietnam,
and assuming they were transported
by one of the three boats
we were tracking,
this is our search area.
It's also possible
the hostages were taken
back to mainland China.
Without any clue
to narrow down the search,
we're looking at an area
of 15° latitude by 20° longitude.
That's over a million square miles, sir.
Hold on.
Grab me the ship's manifest.
Michael Slattery, Captain,
United States Navy.
Doesn't match.
- Not his ID number.
Those aren't serial numbers.
They're geographic coordinates.
They must've navigated by the stars.
Mike, you clever son of a bitch.
Now this one. Again.
I had a dog once.
Always running away.
I teach him to stay.
Just like I teach you to stay.
Really going to enjoy when
I'm the one holding the stick.

Michener: Unfortunately, I cannot
comment on that at this time.
What I can say is we're doing
everything that we can
- Rivera: Jesus.
Every two-bit station in this country
is re-airing that footage
with an infrastructure
that we provided them.
...these images replaying
across the world,
How long has the President
known about the kidnapping?
What has he told the
families of the hostages,
and will he give in
to the terrorists' demands?
When did this become a referendum
on the President's honesty?
There's nothing more he can say
without compromising the mission.
At this rate, how long would it take
for our two destroyers
to reach the
Well, that gives 'em plenty of time
to join in on the hunt for the hostages.
And not enough time to turn back
in case they don't find
the hostages before
the pirates' deadline.
You'd counsel the President to give in,
to turn these ships away from the fight?
If it bought Chandler more time, yes.
Miss Shaw.
As your military advisor
has said, without these ships,
you have no one to investigate
the possibility
of a second outbreak in Japan,
no one to take on the pirates
or Peng when he rears his ugly head.
No one.
Gator: Based
on Captain Slattery's coded messages,
the hostages are approximately here.
The Paracel Islands, sir.
Can't be more than a couple dozen
big enough for
a band of pirates to hide out,
but that's still a lot.
And there are hundreds of miles
between each one.
If we make for it at full power,
we'll hit the first island
in less than eight hours, sir.
Alisha: We'll need to refuel first,
otherwise we won't have enough
to search an area that size.
Pho Kong Island depot?
Yes, sir.
We refueled there on our way in,
and it's not too far out of our way.
- Set a course.
- Aye, sir.
Easy. It's okay. It's okay.
We got to give the James
a smaller target.
Even if our trick
with the coordinates worked,
it's too much ocean to cover.
Diaz.
How tall was that radio tower you saw?
Garnett: You thinking about hacking in?
Aye, ma'am.
Even if I can create some static,
the noise should
give the James a bearing.
If they're in range of the broadcast,
they can beeline right for us.
What do you need to make the noise?
Some kind of shunt?
Any kind of metal
to conduct the signal, a...
To be continued.
Toshiro: You, O-negative. On your feet.
Miller: Ah, come on.
The maid doesn't come till tomorrow.
You are a funny boy. Huh?
Very... funny.
Oh, God.
Check the bounce off the seafloor,
and let me know if you hear
- any engine noise that's not our own.
- Yes, sir.
LNO, reporting for duty.
Where's your crutch?
Oh, I'm good. I'm all right.
So where do you want me?
You can run the land team from there,
right next to the T.A.O.
Roger that.
Fueling station's just over the horizon.
I want the UAV ready for a fly-over.
- Roger that.
- I'll ready the landing party.
Sir. UAV approaching Pho Kong station.
Very well.
Is that what I think it is?
Destroyers. Definitely not ours.
Chandler: Chinese.
CIC, Bridge, break off, break off.
Get that UAV out of there.
Increase speed. Get 10,000 feet
and break off 90°.
That's what's left
of their South Sea fleet.
Four ships against one.
Those are tough odds, even for you.
We never broadcast our position.
How did they know we were coming?
Chandler: It was the smart play.
This is the only refueling port
within 1,000 miles.
Damn it.
Fuel's at 21%.
Not enough to get us back to Okinawa.
Well, even if we got to Japan,
we'd have no backup,
and Peng is getting
exactly what he wants.
All of our ships are out of the region.
I'm not so sure that Peng's
behind the kidnapping.
Danny: He's got four warships
that are blocking our only hopes
of finding them.
Oh, I'm not saying
that he doesn't want us dead,
but Peng and the pirates
make strange bedfellows.
Maybe they have different agendas.
Didn't Peng call the President
to pledge his full support
in rescuing our crew?
Why don't we ask POTUS
to demand he clear the blockage?
Force his hand
and then see where he stands.
And then Peng says yes
and then during the refueling,
the James accidentally goes up in flames
and he pins it on the pirates again.
Agreed.
The President shouldn't ask
Peng for the fuel.
We should.
We call him ourselves?
No, that'll just give
his warships our location.
Jesse'll fly us into Hong Kong.
We can be inside his mansion
in just under two hours.
Well, we will certainly have
a lot to discuss.
Sorry, sir. Are we talking about
what we're talking about?
We're gonna break into the headquarters
of the Chinese President.
What are we looking at
in terms of security?
Uh  dozens of armed
guards posted inside and out.
Each room and hallway requires key
card access, also CCTV security.
Val hacked into Peng's security system
when we were at the mansion.
We can own the cameras and doors.
That'll get us inside.
CIC can keep eyes on you from the sky.
That still leaves the guards.
Not sure how many we can drop
before alerting the rest of 'em.
We do this right, nobody gets killed.
I'm not giving Peng an excuse
to start an all-out war.
Prep the helo.
It's one thing
to go hunting for pirates,
but pulling Peng out of his bed
in the middle of the night...
How are you going to get
the President to sign off on this?
A rogue Navy captain with a hero complex
driven mad by the loss of his shipmates
takes matters into his own hands.
That's the story you'll have to tell
if this operation does not
go as I've planned.
You can't be serious.
I wanted to tell you personally
and privately, sir,
so I can prepare you for the worst.
The worst being we lose the hostages
and start a war with China?
It's important you maintain deniability.
I'm willing to take the heat, sir.
- Jesus, Tom.
- There are no other options, sir,
not if we want to rescue the hostages
by Takehaya's deadline.
This way, we get the fuel we need
and we get answers from Peng
about what's going on.
I need to hear from you
before the 36-hour deadline, either way.
You will, sir. Thank you, sir.
The President's a good man,
and he knows how important it is
to keep the people informed.
The first thing he did before
we even landed in St. Louis
was start broadcasting
to the American people.
I heard the broadcasts from Jackson,
and I know the legend.
It's not a legend. It's the truth.
I appreciate that.
Then why do you go after him
like he's some sort of criminal
while my friends are being
held captive 10,000 miles away?
I get that you're enamored with the guy,
but you've been in your own
little bubble with him for awhile now.
Out here in post-plague America,
there are real concerns
about the new President.
And I'm not just talking about
this hostage situation.
Well, then, people have
a pretty short memory.
They remember the fall
of the last government
and how it felt to be abandoned.
Let's face it.
It is one thing
to come home with a cure.
It's another to rebuild a country
and take on the rest of the world.
Moses delivered his people from slavery
and brought back the word of God
from the mountaintop,
and even he wasn't allowed
into the promised land.
You know, you're smart.
And you keep everybody on their toes,
and that's a good thing.
But you're also glib
and a bit too in love
with your role in all of this.
There's no Watergate.
You're not Woodward and Bernstein.
The President has
a carefully thought-out idea
about how to repair this country.
The last thing anyone needs
is you trying to tear him
and this government down.
Unless you want to go back
to the way things were
before the James
came up the Mississippi.
See something interesting, Captain?
Looks like your boys scored
some good loot.
Slattery: What's with
all the blood, anyway?
Cure not good enough for you?
The American cure is no cure.
We were wiped out.
Then you didn't have the real cure.
My dose. Made in USA.
Doesn't make any sense.
The virus would've killed me.
But I got lucky.
I got shot.
_
A transfusion from a cured person.
The next morning,
the symptoms were gone.
But... it didn't last.
That's why you started
hunting fresh blood.
Our blood.
You went to a lot of trouble
to get me and my people.
Why us?
You needed to pay
for what you did to my country.
Look.
We had... we had reports
of possible mutation.
What if those reports are right?
What you're doing
is making things worse.
You can't send the ships
back to America,
you got to send them into Japan.
Let them investigate.
Our doctors will help.
They'll help.
I give you my word.
Your word means nothing.
Cobra team, Nathan James, radar contact.
Woman: Nomad copies all.
We have eyes on the target, over.
Man: Dive team is set.
Stand by!
Go!
Captain, watch your asses out there.
Noted.
First sign of trouble,
meet us at Raleigh Bravo.
Aye, sir.
Burk: Sasha's Intel is confirmed.
Two-man guard patrols.
Pair on the roof, another in the back,
and two pairs in front.
Eyes on you, Vulture, you're clear.
Roger that. We're on the move.
We're in.
Chandler: And there he is.
Force majeure set.
Looks like they're taking the bait.
Time for some technical difficulties.

_
_

They've rebooted the system.
All right, here we go.

Relax. He can't see us.
Move in. Move.
Clear.
Bravo Team, Bravo Team,
Alpha will have eyes on
the prize in less than 1 minute.
You ready to catch any scooters?
That's an affirmative.
Chandler: Get dressed.
We have some business to discuss.
I am beginning to understand
the roots of your success.
You just refuse to die.
Dying's never been a part
of my operational plan.
I must've misplaced my key.
Door.
Hello, Mr. President.
After all I've done for you,
granting you access to my home,
my resources, my protection.
I even looked the other way
while you helped rogue pilots
steal my cure.
I could've killed you
like I did your friend.
And this is the gratitude I receive?
_
Wolf coming in.
All good. No one knows we're here.
Just in time.
Systems back on... now.
Let us skip the formalities, shall we?
I need fuel for my ship.
Pho Kong harbor is blockaded
by a fleet of your destroyers.
You will remove them
and allow me to refuel.
Is this a joke?
You come into my home,
hold me at gunpoint
to ask for ship fuel?
That's right.
And if I say no?
Then you kill me?
This will surely start a war.
Is your country ready for that?
You're not that great a swimmer.
You don't get me what I came for,
your men will find you
floating face-down in your pool.
And we will slip away
just as silently as we arrived.
No war.
No, Captain Chandler.
You won't.
You are too noble.
You're right.  won't.
I will.
No one ever accused me of being noble.
This one is out for blood.
Let's just say it's personal.
Ah. Your girlfriend?
I take it she was on the plane?
As far as the rest of the world knows,
you had nothing to do
with the attack in Vietnam
or the destruction of my plane.
Your hands are clean
and can stay that way
provided you answer my questions
and give my ship the fuel
it needs to find our people.
If not...
President Peng, as your advisor
on Sino-American affairs,
I'd say this is the best deal
you're gonna get.
Chandler: November Juliet,
this is Vulture Team leader,
we are in business.
I want your ships well over the horizon.
My people see anything they don't like,
I don't care if it's a seagull
too fat to fly...
You don't need to threaten me
anymore, Captain.
I know how this is done.
Chinese ships are on the move.
I'm tracking them on sonar, too.
Very well.
Bridge, CIC, take us in.
Once we're docked,
I want land team supervising
the hook-up.
Aye, ma'am.
I also suggest we check the fuel,
make sure they don't pump us
full of nitromethane.
Good idea.
Get in.
-
-
- Master Chief.
- You okay, sir?
Will this work?
Just gets better and better.
What can they possibly hope to
accomplish airing this footage,
other than cause outrage?
Man:
- Mrs. Miller?
- Leave me alone.
- Just leave me alone.
-Were you aware that your son
was among the captives before
that footage came out?
Please, I don't want
to talk about this now.
How long did it take
before the administration found you?
Nathan James.
Do you feel that the President is doing
enough to save him?
My son, he fought
to bring home the cure.
Shame on you if you don't
bring my boy home.
and a bitter indictment
of this administration.
And with no end in sight
to this hostage crisis,
Damn it, Jacob.
Man: Shore up position
for the hose off deck.
Fuel's clean, sir.
Begin refueling.
Find anything?
Nothing that connects him to Takehaya.
Takehaya?
You think I am working with him?
Not much of a stretch.
My plane goes down
same time my friends are kidnapped
thousands of miles away.
There's coincidence,
and there's conspiracy.
You want us to stop rummaging
through your things,
maybe it's time for some answers.
Wolf: Sasha.
What do you make of this?
Map of the Paracels.
All these islands checked off
like you were searching for something.
As I have told you, Captain,
before you came to China,
the pirates were my biggest problem,
threatening my ships,
taking what did not belong to them.
Takehaya is the worst of the worst.
So you're hunting him.
And you don't know where he is.
If I did, I would've already
kill him myself.
Maybe.
But there's still the small matter...
...of a very big coincidence.
-
- Danny: Bogey approaching.
_
_
_
_
_
_
I suggest we wrap things up.
He will be back.
Michener: Gentlemen, Mrs. Price.
We were all seated around the table here
just 4 1/2 months ago
forming a new national government.
Representing your regions,
you helped bring people together,
one nation under God.
I'm calling you now
to ask for that support again.
Sir, I don't know how they're reacting
to this hostage situation in St. Louis,
but I can tell you
it's not playing well
here in the Southwest.
People are outraged.
I understand, and I'm acting
as swiftly and as smartly as possible.
This situation is fluid,
to say the least.
But we're hoping that Captain Chandler
can give us some answers
before the deadline.
What I really need from everyone
right now is time...
time to assess the dynamic
situation across the world,
time for Captain Chandler
to do what he does.
He got us this far.
We owe him that much.
Mr. President, the next few hours
will determine the future,
for better or worse.
But you have my support.
Croft: Mine, too, Mr. President.
Jeffrey, you know I don't agree
with your recent policy moves,
the rations, the property laws and such,
and I can safely say
that the good survivors
of TexArkana will not abide
a strong, central government
coming out of Missouri
if they don't have confidence
in a non-elected President.
But on this, we are united.
I will do my best to keep
the pitchforks at bay.
Bring home our people.
Thank you. All of you.
Incoming.
Rise and shine.
-
-
CCF, what's your fuel level?
Woman: 85%, ma'am.
Peng: The clock is ticking.
You have only eight hours
before Takehaya's deadline.
And he will certainly keep his word
and start executing hostages.
We'll leave,
but not until I get the truth
about why you tried to kill me.
You came to my home, then you insult me,
accuse me of atrocities
in front of all the other delegates.
No.
That's not it.
Maybe I needed your help
to fight the pirates.
Your country would never send support.
I could force their hand
by framing Takehaya for your deaths.
Or maybe I wanted to draw
your country into a war,
take out its best leader.
Or maybe it was personal.
You want the truth?
The truth is... I wanted you dead.
At this point in our world history,
isn't that reason enough?
The most important
is that we now have
a common enemy in Takehaya,
and you are running out of time.
Burk: Refuel complete, sir.
Roger that. We're on our way home.
Alpha, you got six tangos
coming your way from the north end.
Green?
Danny: Hall is clear.
They got our north exfil covered.
We'll take the south side.
Kill the cameras.
Thanks for the hospitality.
I'm taking this.
With my complements.
South.
Drop it! Drop it!
You next.
Go. Kill Takehaya.
I'll see you again.
I look forward to it.
_
_
Fuel's at full capacity, sir.
We even found a warehouse
filled with canned goods,
sodas, snacks, kind of like
a regular gas station.
Hope you picked up some lottery tickets.
Could be our lucky day.
Sasha: Here's our original search area.
Lieutenant Burke, can we overlay
Peng's map with our own?
Suddenly our search area just
got a hell of a lot smaller.
We can rule out all these islands.
Chandler: Leaving
just those five to search.
Outstanding.
Sir, I recommend we search east to west.
That'll put the morning sun behind us.
Very well.
Set a course, all ahead, full.
Aye, sir.
Six hours to the deadline.
Let's make 'em count.
Michael Slattery, Captain,
United States Navy.
Serial number 17181120.
I rewatched the video.
Very clever.
And very stupid.
You have led your friends
to their deaths.
Approaching the first island now, sir.
CIC, Bridge. I want full power, sonar.
Peng's subs could be lurking.
Sensor mine! Sensor mine!
-
- Pull engines back, full!
