All right, just to
make it interesting, anybody can
open with a pair of 10s...
but only if you're wearing
civilian boxer shorts.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
You can't set a rule like that.
- No, it's dealer's choice, Major.
- Will you accept
a civilian panty girdle?
- Tens and boxer shorts.
- That is the most absurd rule
I've ever heard.
- Can anybody open?
- I'll open for 25 cents.
I told ya! I told ya!
You owe me a buck and a half.
I'm out. I blew everything last night
on Radar's cockroach races.
He had the winner,
but it come in riderless.
- Riderless?
- The fly fell off.
- I'm in. B.J.?
- I'm in.
- Father, you wanna sit in the game?
- Huh?
Oh, yes. Oh, I had the most
extraordinary dream.
I was a cardinal in Rome,
and the pope had a bad cold.
What do you suppose that means,
Sidney? You're the skull jockey.
Well, Freud said
every dream is a wish.
One time my uncle dreamt
he was dancing with a whale.
When he woke up,
our cow had eaten his pants.
Do you wanna bet, or do you want Sidney
to tell you what that means?
Oh, geez. I'm sorry.
I didn't know it meant anything.
-  You want a loan, Sidney?
- No, I think I'll write a letter.
- I've been putting it off.
- You all right?
- Yeah. What do l... How do I look?
- Cheerful. I'm worried.
- All right. What do you want?
- Two.
-  Who took my cards? Oh.
- Here they are.
-
-  Mm-hmm. Two.
Dear Sigmund,
I've been feeling somewhat
frustrated lately...
and so I came to
a kind of spa.
The waters are
pretty good here.
And the inmates have an interesting
defense against carnage.
- Too rich for me.
-
- Let me see your openers, Margaret.
- Here.
- I'm not talking about your cards.
- Never mind.
- Did you hear that?
- That's great. Can you do a dog?
- Who deals?
-
- What am I holding the cards for?
-
Good evening, ladies and germs. I'm
sorry I'm late, but my watch stopped.
It had to. It's been
running fast all week.
Is this the first time
you've been pregnant?
How long have you had that
throbbing in your wrist?
"Noyse! Noyse!"
- Did you call me, Doctor?
- Why should I call  "Doctor"?
the surgeon.
- Give him his medication.
Somebody's 15 minutes late.
- Right.
# Doo, dee-doo, dee-doo
Whoop, dee-dee #
- Well, your feet seem to be
coming along just fine.
- It's my head, Doc.
Oh, yes. For a minute there
you had athlete's scalp.
Come on.
Give us a little smile.
Three bucks. I swear to you.
These earrings go for 7.50 at the Tokyo P.X.
Don't you think hoops
are a little trashy before breakfast?
If I thought it'd get me out,
I'd wear hula hoops in my ears. 2.50?
- I'll take 'em for 2.50.
- Sold.
I hope I win 'em back. I don't want
the holes in my lobes to close up again.
Sir. Sir, there's been
a terrible accident.
- What happened?
- He got hit with a chopper blade, sir.
If Klinger got hit by a chopper blade,
he'd look like a malted milk.
It was slowing down.
Look what it did to his helmet.
How come it's got
tire tracks on it?
- How's that?
- Ever since he came to,
he only speaks in Arabic, sir.
Gee, what a strange thing.
-
- What'd he say?
- He said,
- Thank you.
Yeah!
It's not gonna work,
Klinger. Yeah!
- Looks like a relapse.
- His eyes have gone back in his head.
He looks like that every day
right after breakfast.
- He's shaking!
-
Radar found me a can
of smoked herring for breakfast...
and right now I'm deliriously happy
cleaning my horse's toenails.
- Don't spoil it!
- Sir, I'm really scared.
-
- Klinger, wake up!
He's ranting, sir. He wants
his father's cheese from the windowsill.
You can have a piece of my herring,
but you're not going home.
Well, thank you very much.
-
- Sophie, how about that Klinger?
Is he a pistol?
I guess what
draws me to these people
is that, faced with aggression...
in its most brutal form...
they've regressed to a state
of antic, if not lunatic, pleasure.
-
-
I'm sorr...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hiya, pal.
Hey, you got any way
to get back to civilization from here?
If this isn't civilization, why am I
standing in a bomb crater?
Thank you, buddy.
You lost from your unit, or are you trying
to see the world on five dollars a day?
No, actually I jumped out
of my airplane.
Such a nice day
you thought you'd walk?
My engine was on fire.
But I managed to drop my load
before I bailed out.
How lucky for you. Come on.
I'll take a look at your leg.
- Are you a doctor?
- That's what they all think here.
Actually,
I just like legs.
Is there a phone here?
I don't want my wife to worry
when I don't show up at home tonight.
- You go home every night from the war?
- Only weekends.
Got a little place in Tokyo.
I tell ya. For me,
the war's been something that
lasts about... 30 minutes a day.
Then it's back to the base
and dinner at the officers' club.
- It's only a war. Why kill yourself?
- Yeah.
My gosh. Will you look at
those boots? What a mess.
What have you been
walkin' in, red clay?
- No, blood.
- That must be kind of rough
on you guys, isn't it?
Well, I tell ya. If I couldn't fly,
I wouldn't touch this war. You fly much?
I was shot out of a cannon once
by the irate husband of a bearded lady.
It's beautiful up there. At 20,000 feet,
the sky is a brilliant blue.
You fly for a while
in that stillness.
Then you take a reading,
press a button, and drop your load.
You've never seen the people
you've been bombing?
Nah. Never.
I'm a really lucky guy.
- Flying so high with
your head in the sky.
- Yeah.
I can't understand why
you call this place the Swamp.
We were thinking of calling it
the Latrine, but that name was taken.
- That's a private letter.
- Then why'd you leave it under your pillow?
Can I have that? I want to erase
anything nice I said about you guys.
Uh, Sidney,
you're a psychiatrist.
Don't you think writing a letter
to Sigmund Freud is a little crazy?
Who better than he
would understand?
- Well, now that makes sense.
-
We couldn't help but notice that
you came for the poker game
and stayed for two weeks.
I just wanted
a little vacation.
Sidney, Biarritz is a vacation.
The Swiss Alps is a vacation.
This is a fungus convention
at Atlantic City.
There's something special
about this place.
You give life here. I'm running
a little low on that right now.
- Would you like to talk about it?
- Well...
winter's the busy season
for shrinks here.
The days get shorter.
The nights get colder.
I was getting 15 cases a week of total
crack-ups. Can I have some of that?
Business was too good.
I was losing people.
Sidney, we all lose patients.
Actually, the straw that broke my back
was this one kid who heard voices...
telling him to kill himself.
I spent a lot of time with him.
One day he was
very calm, relaxed.
Sometimes that's a signal
they've made a decision.
Only somehow...
I missed it.
And that night,
after I went to sleep...
that sweet, innocent,
troubled kid...
listened to the voices.
After that, I started sleeping late.
I wasn't doing my work.
Well, well, well. So the doctor
can't cure himself, huh?
- God, I thought that lump under
his blankets was dirty laundry.
- It is.
I say, if you want to keep
your feet on the ground...
you gotta pull yourself up
by your own bootstraps.
Why don't you pull yourself up
by your own jockstrap?
It makes me no never mind.
I got all my cookies.
If there's
a way to preserve your sanity
in wartime, they've found it.
-
- Hey! Hey, help!
Get a...
Get a medic! Medic!
Come on, you guys!
-
-  Oh, no!
Get 'em out. Be careful!
Look out for broken bones.
- Take a couple guys up front.
We'll work from back here.
- Bob. Dennis. Come up front.
- Get these men back into pre-op.
- This guy's in shock.
Start a glucose I.V.
This kid had one good arm.
Now it's broken.
Make sure those stitches aren't pulled.
Get the X-ray machine going.
- Who the hell did this?
Was O'Donnell drivin'?
- Yes, sir.
That klutz. He isn't makin' any points
for gettin' them there fast.
He's gotta get 'em
there in one piece!
Tell O'Donnell I want
to see him in my office.
And this time he can shake his can!
You got that?
He's dead, sir.
Nurse, I need you
in pre-op. Come on.
- Hathaway, grab the other end of this.
- I can get that.
No, I want him to do it.
- Can I give you a hand, Father?
- Yeah. Get the other end.
- How are you doing, John?
- I didn't know what hit me.
I was on my stretcher, and then
a second later, three guys are
laying on top of me.
I used to wake up every morning
like that when I was a boy.
I had to sleep with my brothers.
I'm not going back in that ambulance.
It's too dangerous.
And I'm not getting in
any chopper.
Well, uh, all right.
We'll send you back
on a nice, slow, safe ship.
You'll see your family
in three or four months.
- Four months?
-
When's the next ambulance leave?
- In an hour or so.
- What's holding it up?
- Didn't I tell you to move
that whole blood back there?
-
Move that blood or I'll make you
drink it, you Transylvanian lunatic!
Major, word has gotten around
that you're feeling kind of low.
Hard to keep a secret
here in Macy's Window East, isn't it?
Well, everyone kind of keeps
an eye on everybody else here.
You're not thinking of
doing anything foolish?
Oh, no. I mainly have
this dull ache behind my nose
and a feeling of listlessness.
Sort of a severe Geritol deficiency.
You ever get like that?
No, never.
I wouldn't permit it.
- How do you manage that?
- I just don't let it get to me.
The wounded don't get to you?
The cold? The food? The rats?
I have a shortage of sulfa,
surgical gowns and rubber gloves.
And I got a call from my fiance
in Tokyo this morning...
who celebrated his birthday
last night without me.
He must miss you very much.
No. He said
had a very good time.
I see.
Am I upset? Am I distressed?
No. One has to be
strong, Major.
In strength is serenity.
Well, I take my hat off
to you, Margaret.
- Just a minute, Major. What is
that thing doing over there?
- I'm sorry. What thing?
You let a woman sit down and have
a drink with you with that thing there?
You mean the athletic supporter?
Major, you're a nurse.
It's disgusting!
Will you put something over it?
- Like a fig leaf?
- How dare you parade
that thing in front of me.
Major, it isn't even mine.
It belongs to one of those repulsive,
drunken, lecherous, evil cretins.
They live like pigs.
They have the morals of baboons.
- Will you please put your hat on it?
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
- My uniform is proud to serve.
I'm sorry you got upset.
- I'm not upset.
- Well, a little agitated.
Not at all. It would be useless.
I wouldn't permit it.
- Right.
- And you can do it if I can.
I don't feel a thing.
I don't feel a thing.
- What have you got there?
-
A couple of guys fell on him...
and pulled the stitches in his
abdominal wall and peritoneum.
B.J.'s scrubbing up.
-  You had to go back in?
- She started bleeding again.
I guess I didn't get all
the holes the first time.
Hey, she's just a little kid.
Eight years old. I got a granddaughter
back home who's about eight.
- What happened to her?
- Somebody dropped a bomb
on her village from an airplane.
- Who did it?
- He just dropped it.
He didn't autograph it.
No, I mean was it one of theirs
or one of ours?
- What difference does that make?
- A lot. It makes a lot of difference.
Not to her.
- You brought me in there
on purpose, didn't you?
- Yep.
You're a real S.O.B.
You know that?
Look, you seem
like a decent guy.
Too decent to think that
this can be anything like a clean war.
From up there it is.
Was.
God, she's just
a little baby.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
a long way to come down.
- It's coming nicely, Frank.
- Actually, it's one of several.
I don't intend getting caught more than
six paces away from a good hole...
if somebody shouts
"air raid."
- Prior planning.
- Prevents poor performance.
- Hmm. Catchy.
- Yeah, well, I'm going home
in one piece, brother.
- You sound determined.
- Let's just say I've been
getting some signals...
from my wife back home.
- She needs a man there. A whole man.
- Signals?
Yeah. You know, hints.
- She's been going in for strange things.
- Like what?
She's not behaving like herself,
and let's just leave it at that, okay?
- Okay.
- Oh, what the heck.
You're a psychiatrist.
I guess you've heard it all, huh?
Well, I thought
I'd heard it all.
She got together with
some of her lady friends...
and they went on a trip
to Indianapolis... for no reason.
- For no reason?
- Just to look around.
It cost $55. And she's
getting mixed up in politics...
stuffing envelopes
for the Republican Club...
and maybe even, uh...
ringing doorbells.
It sounds as though
she's stepping out on her own a little.
- That's what I think.
- People grow, Frank.
- When I go home, I want
the same girl I married.
- Right.
Well, she's changing.
She's becoming...
sexy and...
provocative and...
I got a letter today with a picture
of her in slacks...
walking away
from the camera.
Frank, maybe she's just trying
to find out who she is.
That doesn't mean
she's leaving you.
You bet she isn't, bub. I happen to
believe in the sanctity of marriage...
no matter how ugly
or disgusting it gets.
I'll kill her
before I divorce her.
I'm not suggesting either.
Oh, no...
of course you're not.
I should have known better than to tell
something personal to a psychiatrist.
Actually, Sigmund,
it's a wonder more people here...
don't take a vacation
from reality.
Don't take a vacation
from reality.
Some people even manage to grow.
-
- Come on! Come on!
...
...
Uh, sir, I have some papers
for you to sign before you go to bed.
Just in time, Radar. I was just saying
good night to Mrs. Potter.
Say good night
for me too, sir.
- Unless she's in
her nightgown or something.
-
I'll ignore that.
Uh, sir, here's
the mess requisition.
- I ordered 500 hams.
- Isn't that kind of a lot?
Well, Sergeant Skinowsky from
over the 309th says he'll trade
me ice cream and fruit for ham.
I figured it might be a good
idea to order a few extra.
Good boy, Radar.
I haven't had fruit for so long,
my colon will think it's a stickup.
That's a good one, sir.
- This is the updated patients list.
- Right.
- What's in the box?
- Um, it's the ambulance driver's
personal effects, sir.
It's going out
to Graves Registration.
- Did you write a little note
for me to his folks?
- Yes, sir. It's right here.
I never know what to say.
Of all the lousy duties I've
had to perform in this service...
that's always
been the lousiest.
You can change it
if you want, sir.
I'm not sure all the words
are exactly right or anything.
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. O'Donnell...
"It is with real deep sadness
that I must tell you
of the death of your son.
"You can be
very, very proud of Jerry.
"He never took a human life,
and he died...
"while he was trying to save
the lives of five other fellows.
"He was rushing them
to the evac...
"which is short for
evacuation hospital, in Seoul...
"when his ambulance overturned.
"He was a real good boy,
Mr. And Mrs. O'Donnell...
"and I know he loved you
both very much.
"He spoke of you often
to my company clerk,
Corporal Walter O'Reilly.
"We were proud of him at MASH...
and we'll miss Jerry...
very, very much."
- Thank you, Radar. Don't change a word.
- Thank you, sir.
The one person
I can't figure out, even with
all you've taught me, Sigmund...
is B.J. Hunnicutt.
-
- Get that guy to pre-op now.
-
- Oh, give me that.
-
-
- Oh, hi.
- You! You're the practical joker?
It certainly looks
that way, doesn't it?
- Would you like to help?
- Sure.
What do I do?
As loud as you can,
shout, "Air raid!"
Air raid! Air raid!
Air raid!
Air raid! Air raid!
Air raid!
"Colonel Potter is pleased to announce
that today is the first day of spring.
"we are unveiling
the cherry tree branch...
"that we have been trying
to grow in a hothouse kind of...
"ever since Major Houlihan
got the branch for us...
Oh, thank you.
"And now, in honor of
the first day of spring..."
Okay, that's it.
- You leaving, Sidney?
- Afraid so.
- Hate to be cured and run.
- You feel better?
Yeah, I think I do a little.
It's like spring at MASH.
If you can't find it, and you can't
feel it, you just go ahead and make it.
Somewhere in here,
I'm coaxing a little bud to grow.
- Meanwhile, I'm goin' back to work.
- See ya at the game next week?
Yes, I'll be here with $20 in my pants
and three aces up my sleeve.
Show a little imagination.
Don't make them all spades.
Clamp.
- I'll be closing in five minutes.
-
...
