Let's say, in the next war, the
generals strip down to their B.V.D.'s...
and have at it with baseball bats
while the rest of us stay home.
That is so like you, Hunnicutt.
Not a patriotic bone in your body.
No wonder the man flunked anatomy.
He thinks there are patriotic bones.
- Four-oh silk.
- We only have three-oh.
I'll take three-oh,
and you'll owe me one.
You just don't understand people
wanting to fight for their country.
Sure I do,
but it isn't my country.
Don't you realize that if we weren't
here, the Commies would overrun
the whole darn place?
Serve 'em right.
The weather stinks, and the food's lousy.
And the room service
leaves a lot to be desired.
-  Sponge.
-  Sponge.
Those Commies think they can run the
world. Let's see 'em try to run Newark.
- In two weeks, they'd end up
in the trunk of a Buick.
-
- Sir, there's a Colonel Bidwell
to see you.
- Tell him I'm busy.
He said, if you said you were busy,
I was to say it's urgent.
You can tell him to take
a flying leap...
- I'll be out when I'm finished.
- That's what I told him.
- Colonel Potter?
- Right.
I'm Colonel Bidwell, "l" Corps
Operations Officer.
- What can I do for you?
- Who's your best doctor?
- Why do you wanna know?
- Will you answer the question, please?
We have several good men.
- Do you have one who's outstanding?
- Yes, we do.
- What's his name, Colonel?
- Our best man is Captain
Benjamin Franklin Pierce.
- I'll take him.
- For what?
Personal physician to General Theodore
A. Korshak, "l" Corps Commander.
- Korshak? "Tamer of the Tiger Tank"?
- None other.
- Pierce isn't your man.
- He is if he's the best.
If General Korshak were being
carried in on a stretcher...
I'd say Pierce
is the fella you want.
But a personal physician?
No, sirree.
- Why not?
- Because Pierce is a maverick...
from the top of his unshorn head
to the tips of his uncut toenails.
- You're saying he's not G.I.
- He isn't even housebroken.
I appreciate your candor,
but I still want to meet him.
Whatever you say.
He's in O.R. Right now.
Nurse.
Listen, Bidwell. A lot of men are alive
today because Pierce works here.
- I don't wanna lose him.
- Are you suggesting the general
settle for second best?
Are you suggesting  should?
You ever get the feeling
there's a war going on?
There's always a war going on. War is
the world's favorite spectator sport.
- Give me some more skin sutures.
- Everybody knows war is hell.
Remember, you heard it here last.
War isn't hell.
War is war, and hell is hell.
And of the two,
war is a lot worse.
- How do you figure that, Hawkeye?
- Easy, Father.
Tell me, who goes to hell?
- Sinners, I believe.
-
There are no innocent
bystanders in hell.
But war is chockfull of them...
little kids, cripples, old ladies.
Well, I'm not. I'm here because
my country needs me.
How do you know it wasn't
just some excuse to ship you
The Korean War was invented so your
parents wouldn't come looking for you.
You're a pair of sickos!
I'm not getting a pulse.
No.
- No pulse.
- Amanda! Adrenaline! Bag 'im!
Where's the adrenaline?
Into the I.V. Tubing.
Come on! Come on, damn it!
I'm gonna go inside.
Give me a knife. Rib spreader!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Come on.
Come on. Live, damn it. Live.
Don't let the bastard win.
I'm getting a pulse.
All right. Let's close up.
Chest tube.
- Pressure's coming up.
-  Nice goin', Hawk.
- Klinger.
- Get the new sutures going.
- Congratulations, son.
- I guess it just wasn't his turn.
That's right. If it had been his turn,
you would've worked on him.
Comin' through!
- Hey, do me a big favor, will ya, pal?
- What, Doctor?
- Move it or get it amputated.
- I beg your pardon?
Don't beg.
Just get your butt outta here.
Give me the scissors.
You keep loading those sutures.
- Seen enough, Colonel?
- A little hot-tempered, isn't he?
Yes, and this is one
of his cooler days.
Well, I told you Pierce wasn't
the man you were looking for.
Fine doctor, but undisciplined.
I should add he hates brass.
I'll include that in my report
to the general.
According to Pierce, the only
medical attention generals require...
is a daily high colonic.
Incredible.
Have a good trip back.
Sorry you had to waste all this time.
- Listen, Potter.
- Yes, Colonel?
In the operating room,
when Pierce was trying to save
that man's life, he said...
"Don't let the bastard win."
Who was he talking about?
Death. When it comes to death,
Pierce is a sore loser.
It's a part of life, part of war.
And we're soldiers.
Maybe we are, but Pierce isn't.
He's just humoring us
by wearing that uniform.
He's one doctor who'll never be
nonchalant where death is concerned.
He'll always take it personally.
He could crack up
with that attitude.
You're right. He's a good man
to stay away from.
- Colonel.
- Sayonara.
Sometimes I get the feeling
we're only a bunch of mechanics.
- Mechanics?
- Sure.
Doctors fix people up,
so they can go on living.
We fix them up, so they can
go back and get killed.
We're running a body-and-fender shop
at a demolition derby.
Well, I'm not a mechanic.
I'm a surgeon and a gentleman.
He uses the right fork
and the wrong knife.
When his patient dies, he always says
"Excuse me" before leaving the table.
There's nothing wrong
with manners.
We all heard how Pierce talked
to that visiting colonel.
He gave the 4077 th a black eye.
You gave it a black armband.
That man was a general's aide.
Where would we be without leadership?
I'd be in the backseat
of a '46 DeSoto...
"schnuggling" with Wanda Lamperski.
- Hi, Radar.
- Hey, Mulligan.
I hear you're going home.
Yeah. I finally got my points.
First stop Seoul, and then
I'm Bitter Creek bound.
- You're what?
- Bitter Creek.
- A small town in Wyoming.
That's where I'm from.
- Oh.
I just wanted
to tell you good-bye.
Hey, gee, thanks, Mulligan.
Good luck to you.
There is something
I'd like you to do for me...
something I'd like you
to take care of.
Yeah? Go ahead, sit down.
- What is it?
- Well, it's, uh, very precious...
and, uh... very beautiful.
Is it a bird or somethin'?
Nah, it's a girl.
A girl?
- You mean, a girl?
- That's right.
Look, Radar, you're a real nice,
gentle guy, and l...
I want you to be her friend.
Yeah?
Well, her name's Mai Ping.
I've told her all about you.
She's waiting for you
over at Rosie's Bar.
Oh, boy.
A real girl.
Mai Ping, this is Radar.
- Uh, O'Reilly.
- Radar O'Reilly.
Treat her nice, okay?
Good-bye, Mai Ping.
Please sit down, Walter.
Okay. Thank you.
Oh, would you like a drink?
They serve a nice
grape Nehi here.
Oh, no, thank you.
- Are you from Korea?
- Oh, yes. I am Korean.
- And you?
- I'm just here for the war.
It's a pretty country,
except where it's bombed.
Mmm.
You have any hobbies?
You like sports?
Mmm, no, I don't.
- Uh, would you like to take a walk?
- Yes.
Shall I show you my hut?
Your what? Your hut? Now?
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, can I help you?
- Mmm.
- Hey, there's a baby in your basket.
- Yes, there is.
- Is he your brother?
- He's my son.
- Lee Chin Mulligan?
- Yes.
Ah, that's nice.
-
- Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Have you ever really
considered the foot?
Yeah, but I prefer girls.
Look at it. The foot is
an incredible thing.
- What's so hot about a foot?
- You can stand on 'em.
You can walk on 'em.
You can kick people
in the tush with 'em.
You sold me.
I'll take a pair in my size.
There are none in your size.
- Ah, welcome to our hovel.
- It's not much, but it's
close to where we live.
- And only minutes to the nearest war.
- I'm glad you like it here.
- I nearly lost Hawkeye today.
- In a poker game?
I'd never throw you into the pot
unless I had at least two pair.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Ever hear of General Korshak?
Is he related to "General Chaos"?
Same guy. General Ted Korshak
sent that colonel up here.
- That bozo in the O.R.?
-
Looking for a personal physician
for the general.
- Why?
-
had his own doctor and decided
he couldn't live without one.
Actually, for the doctor,
it's easy duty.
You eat well, hotel beds,
and the hours aren't bad.
- So the colonel was
lookin' me over, huh?
- Yep.
- And I blew my big chance.
- It was the way you acted in O.R.
He thought you were crude,
rude and unmilitary.
- A triple threat.
- And I wasn't even wearing my swim fins.
You were absolutely disgraceful...
and I think I'll buy you a drink.
You're not gonna like him, General.
- Gave you a lot of static, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- Downright insolent. A real hardnose.
- That makes two of us.
- Hi, Radar.
- Oh, hi, Klinger. How's it goin'?
Marvelous. I love peeling
these little fellas.
- I'm considering it as a career.
- Oh, that's neat.
- Hey, Radar. There's a new
invention just came out.
- Yeah?
It's really catching on.
It's called the bag.
Thanks. Listen, Klinger,
this isn't for me, you know?
What do I care who they're for,
as long as I don't have to peel 'em?
- Oh.
-
Oh. Thanks a lot, Klinger.
- How do you like bein' a father?
- Oh, I'm not the father.
- I'm sort of the foster uncle.
-
Do kids like 'em scrambled?
How's it feel to be
a family man, Radar?
- I worry a lot.
- What about?
About the baby.
Geez, how's he gonna get along?
I mean, he's so, uh...
He's so small and little.
Whenever I'm not with him, I worry.
And when I'm there, I worry even more.
- You're a good father, Radar.
- I'm not the father.
I know.
You're still a good father.
Thanks.
- What's it like being the real thing?
- You worry a lot.
Geez. I get antsy if even a day goes by,
and I don't see little Lee Chin.
And I'm just his uncle. I mean,
I'm not really his uncle, of course.
- Are you and Mai Ping...
- What?
- Nothin'.
- Oh, no, nothin' like that.
We're just friends.
I envy you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Gee, and you a doctor
and an officer.
You got a family, Radar.
Take my word for it.
It's better than
either of those things.
Well, I really appreciate you coming
along to give the baby a checkup.
- No problem.
- You know, sometimes he cries.
What do you think that is?
You think he's just hungry
or something?
Could be, pal.
There's a lot of it goin' around.
This way, General.
Mildred, just another 14 months
and 11 days till retirement.
- Ah! General.
- At ease, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.
- General Korshak, Colonel Potter.
Pleased to meet you, General.
Is there anything I can do for you?
- Well, you could put me
out of my misery.
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm parched.
- Oh, certainly.
- Colonel?
- Thanks.
- Mmm. Good scotch.
- Thank you, General.
Is that all you wanted?
Sit down, Colonel.
You have a tough guy
on your staff here, name of Pierce.
Bidwell tells me he's a piece
of real live ammo.
Did the colonel tell you
he hates generals...
more than watered gin
and earaches put together?
Me too. Never met one yet
that was worth his weight in Spam.
If Pierce wants an argument, he's gonna
have to do a lot better than that.
- I think he can, General. Oh.
- Just what the doctor ordered.
I'd like to meet
my new personal physician.
Now.
- Is he okay?
- Fit as a fiddle and ready for love.
- What?
- Lee Chin is just fine.
Thank you.
Would you like some tea?
No, thanks.
I've gotta get back.
The army's a lot like the A.M. A...
both frown on house calls.
- Here we are.
- Here we go.
Oh, what a big boy.
- Hey, B.J.
- Mm-hmm?
I really appreciate this.
This was swell of ya.
No problem, Radar.
You have a beautiful family.
Bye.
He's very healthy.
- Walter.
- Hmm?
He looks like you.
- You think so?
- Oh, yes.
He's very handsome.
Well, maybe the eyes.
I hear you're a real pistol, Doc.
Only when I'm loaded.
I'm not much of a doctor
once you get to know me.
- According to Potter, you're the best.
- Well, the colonel drinks.
Only in groups of one or more.
What's your medical
background, Captain?
Typical. I had all
the childhood diseases.
Mumps, measles, colic... you name it.
- You  insolent.
- Well.
I never studied seriously.
If I hadn't cheated on the final exam...
and been a personal friend of the
cadavers, I never would've graduated.
- And that was high school.
- This guy kills me.
What higher praise
for a physician?
I want this man.
Uh, General, I'd really rather not
be your personal physician...
or your court jester, or whatever
it is you're shopping for.
Do you realize what an opportunity
I'm offering you, Captain?
Sure. The moon, the stars, your
high school letterman's sweater.
Same deal I offered
Nurse Baker last night.
Pierce, I have enough ribbons
and medals to... to cover that wall.
Well, bring 'em around.
It'll liven up the place.
I'm not movin'
those pictures.
Ribbons and medals don't mean
a thing. These are a different matter.
- These you have to go out
and get for yourself.
- You mean, they don't deliver?
You don't get them
by taking "no" for an answer.
- You see this?
- What?
There's supposed to be
a medical insignia there, a caduceus.
I probably dropped it
in a patient.
You know how I got that?
I mean, if it was there.
- By working your butt off?
- That's right.
So as long as I have
to be in Korea...
why don't you let me do what
I was trained to do... be a doctor.
Okay. Let's see you in action.
- How is it, Doc?
- It's awfully high.
You almost rang the bell.
- Blame it on the major.
- Thank you very kindly, sir.
I wonder whether
you know my fiance...
Lieutenant Colonel
Donald Penobscott.
He's stationed in Tokyo.
He's a great admirer of yours, General.
- I know a Penobscott...
no neck, one eyebrow.
- That's him!
- One eyebrow?
- Mmm.
- Over which eye.
- Both.
Oh, yeah. Cro-Magnon.
- It's very sexy.
- Come on, General.
We'll take some dirty pictures
of your lungs.
- You're really somethin'.
-
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Mulligan.
Oh.
I got to Seoul. I was practically
on the plane when...
when I realized I couldn't leave you
and the baby.
I love you, Mai Ping.
I love you, Mulligan.
Bitter Creek sounds nice.
Hey, uh, thanks for, uh...
everything, Radar.
Oh, heck.
It wasn't everything. I just
took care of the baby. That's all.
He's a terrific baby.
I didn't, uh... There we go.
Oh, hey, listen. I borrowed
your slippers. They're...
They're really nice.
I enjoyed them.
Um, I guess I don't have to put these on.
Colonel Potter needs me. I'm sure.
I knew you were coming back.
I think that's terrific.
Um... I gotta fill out
the monthly report.
Walter.
Thanks.
Bye.
Okay, okay. I'll do
anything you say...
except give up my stogies
and my scotch.
- Then I might as well sign on
as your personal physician.
- Good.
- As long as I can come back
here after the funeral.
- What funeral?
Yours. You're looking for
a doctor to keep you alive...
and you're doing everything
you can to kill yourself.
I'm in pretty good shape
for a man my age.
- You are if you're 103.
- Not funny, Pierce.
The stroke that's headed
your way is a lulu.
It could come today,
tomorrow or next Tuesday.
- Or never, right?
- Wrong. Six months at the outside.
- How do you know that?
- I'm a doctor. See?
- How do you know that?
- I'm a doctor. See?
You got high blood pressure,
General. You drink, you smoke.
You're 20 pounds overweight
without the medals.
One... go to Tokyo,
check into a hospital,
start taking care of yourself.
- Two?
- Sit on a land mine.
If you're trying to scare me,
young man, you're not succeeding.
Unlike the other guys who come
through here, it's up to you...
whether you live or die.
Can't do it, Pierce.
I've got a war to fight.
Okay. Your next foxhole
will be six feet deep.
You really lay it on
with a shovel, don't you?
- I'm not kidding!
- Neither am I.
Start packing.
You'll get your orders.
- Driver.
- Wait a second.
No, no. Hold it!
Wait a minute! Hold it!
- All right. Hold it.
- Look, General...
if you take my advice, you can
live to be an old Korshak.
But you don't need me hanging
around counting your calories...
There are a lot of boys
who come through this place...
whose lives I can save
if I'm here.
You guys always say the men come first.
Well, do they or don't they?
They do.
All right, Pierce.
You stay here and do your job.
I'll do mine.
I can take orders too.
Good. I'll have a corned beef
on rye with mustard.
You're right.
The kid is a pistol.
Let's go. Come on.
Don't forget the ribbons
for the wall!
Is it true, Colonel?
General Korshak is still in the market
for a personal physician?
- That's right, Burns.
- I'm perfect for the job.
- I'd like your recommendation.
- You've got it.
- And mine.
- And mine.
- The motion's carried.
-
I'd appreciate it, sir, if you'd
send a letter to the general
outlining my qualifications.
- Good idea.
-
- What are they?
- I have a thriving practice
back in Fort Wayne.
They're thriving
'cause Frank's not there.
- And a splendid war record.
- Should you mention the time...
- he dropped his bubble gum
in the patient?
- Bubble gum. Good.
Or the time he sneezed and performed
an accidental appendectomy.
- Fainted in O.R. 27 times.
- Threw up in post-op 12.
- Overslept 48.
- Colonel, you're not
writing all that down?
I'm getting it all.
It may help.
- The hysterectomy on that sergeant.
- Boy, was he sore about that.
- Colonel! I...
- Oh, let's not forget Major Houlihan.
Oh, Major Houlihan.
We shouldn't forget...
