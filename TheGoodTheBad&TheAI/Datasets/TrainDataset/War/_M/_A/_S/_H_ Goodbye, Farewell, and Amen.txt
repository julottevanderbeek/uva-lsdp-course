Have you seen these orders?
I can't make heads or tails of them.
That's the young fellow
we had.
-  How're you feeling?
-  Great. How are you?
You look a little thin,
don't you?
-  How have you been sleeping?
- On my back.
The bed is terrible here. You can feel
the springs right through the mattress.
Mm-hmm.
Yesterday you were gonna tell me about
that day at the beach.
It was great.
Very hot.
A lot of people say too much sun
is no good for you.
And, you know, carcinomas
can result from that.
This, of course,
would concern me as a physician.
I'd like to get back
to the beach.
Hey, go ahead.
Take the rest of the day off.
What happened that day?
You know, I really should be allowed to go home!
I... There's nothing wrong with me!
What was it like
at the beach?
It was great. It was the Fourth of July.
-
- There was a lot of fighting going on...
but it was way over at Kumsong,
so Colonel Potter gave most of us the day off.
We went to a cove north of Inchon,
and we had a great time.
- ##
-
I got it!
-
-
Not fair, fella!
That's against the rules!
-  We had
a great time, and we went home.
- What was that like?
Going home?
Hilarious. Amusing.
Genial. Joyful.
Raucous. Funny.
- What happened?
- It was great. We were laughing and singing.
##
Can we please have
that bottle back here?
This guy can't wait!
So you had a great time
on the bus.
And, so, we had a great time
on the bus.
And, so, we enjoyed ourselves. And so, and so,
and so, and so, and so, and so, and so.
I'm not, however,
having a great time here.
First place, I don't like the color
of these walls, if you can call that a color.
I don't know what's on those walls,
but I think it hit the fan first.
-
- Come in.
There's a phone call
for Captain Pierce.
- Good time as any for a break.
- Yeah. Let's knock off till Christmas.
Rooms may not be much here,
but they got a great bellhop.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
"Yel-low." Snake pit.
We never close.
Hawk, it's B. J!
How you doin'?
How the hell do you think? I've been locked up
for the last week in a "wackateria."
Well, listen,
Sidney's the doctor.
You want a laugh?
He says you're the doctor.
I'm the doctor!
I sew people back together.
Why is he keeping a brilliant surgeon
locked up? I mean, what's behind that?
Uh, look, um, Father Mulcahy
would like to say hello.
Hello, Hawkeye. Need anything?
Can we send anything down to you?
Yeah. How about a Band-Aid
for my finger?
I got a blister from going...
Uh, yes, well,
I'll... see what I can do.
Uh, uh, perhaps, uh,
Colonel Potter, uh, uh, could, uh...
Uh, mmm.
Pierce,
we miss you here.
I miss me there too. It's lonely here,
especially at night.
I do hear the guy in the next room.
He cries all night.
Uh, so, uh...
Oh, listen, have you heard the latest?
The truce talks are on again.
- Yeah?
- They must be serious about peace this time...
because the fighting's
gotten a lot worse.
They're trying to grab more real estate...
before they sign, you know.
Lots of casualties.
Just remember. Every day you let them keep
your best surgeon, you're killing patients.
Uh, uh, Pierce, Margaret won't rest
till I put her on the phone.
Now, you just hold on there.
- Hawkeye?
- "Thpeaking."
No. You'll be great.
- How do you feel?
- Like a hostage. How about you?
Oh, same old stuff.
This and that, ups and downs.
Uh, what can I say?
Well, that pretty much covers it.
Nice talking to you.
Oh, it was great
talking to you!
- You just take care of yourself, okay?
- Mmm.
Klinger
wants to say hello!
- What do you say, Captain?
- Hello, Klinger.
- What do you say, Captain?
- Hello, Klinger.
Hey, you sound perfectly normal to me.
How is it there? You crazy about the place?
Oh, he loves it!
He loves it.
Can you believe that Syngman Rhee? We
almost got peace, and he wants to keep fighting.
-  No, no, no.
- This could go on forever!
Uh, Pierce? It's me again. Don't listen to him.
Peace is right around the corner.
We're all making plans for home.
Isn't that right?
I can't wait to get back to the states
and work in a real hospital...
with sanitary conditions and regular shifts,
and plain, old ordinary diseases.
B. J. Says he's gonna make a ring
out of his first kidney stone.
Ah.
You just take care of yourself, okay?
We all miss you here.
Then get me out!
Well, he didn't
sound too bad.
- He was more relaxed than I was.
- You gotta know how to handle people like that.
Hunnicutt! I've had a lot of experience
with mental illness.
One of the guys I grew up with
back in Toledo, Eddie Fahey.
Crazy as a fruitcake.
Potter.
He ran into a light post.
Ended up with a steel plate in his skull.
You know those little black and white
Scottie dogs with the magnets in 'em?
- He used to wear one on his forehead. Houlihan.
- Klinger.
We gotta do something about these refugees.
We're not zoned for this. Have a detail build
a pen for those animals behind Rosie's.
Hi.
Can I take a look at you?
Colonel, does that look like
pellagra to you?
Sure could be.
Let's line 'em up for physicals.
- Klinger, we gotta take...
- Got it, sir.
- We'll use the V.I.P. Tent.
- Just a second. Soon-Lee!
Soon-Lee, will you tell
all these people...
the doctor wants to examine them,
make sure they're okay?
Uh, yes.
What's the latest count, Sergeant?
Sir, we got 10 new P.O.W.'s in this morning.
It's getting pretty crowded in there.
We'll have to let out the seams
on that barbed wire.
I'll check these guys
after I look at the refugees.
We better get peace fast.
Sneaking up on it like this is killin' us.
Well, you know how armies are when you
try to take their war away.
Sergeant, give these men more blankets,
extra rations, and another latrine trench.
Not necessarily
in that order.
I'll be back. South Korea's
in my waiting room.
Oh! Wonderful!
Charles! Charles! I just got the most
wonderful letter from my father!
- How nice.
- He doesn't think I should
go to the states after the war.
- Doesn't he?
- He's been talking
to some of his friends in the army.
He's arranged to have me
assigned to an administrative post in Tokyo!
I'd be out of nursing, but he says
it's the best way to get promoted!
Incredible news. I am tickled pink.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Well, excuse me for bothering you.
I'm just tryin' to work out my future.
- You have your life all mapped out.
- Oh, do I?
It so happens I've heard from a friend
in Boston who informs me that...
my application to be chief of thoracic surgery
at Boston Mercy may be turned down.
That's terrible.
Why?
Because while I have been sharpening
my surgical skills here in Korea...
a certain incompetent has been sharpening
his political skills in Boston!
And he's slithering in
ahead of me!
I can't believe
you won't get it.
Well, I wish I could share
your optimism, Margaret...
but right now, I have a hundred Boy Scouts
tying knots in my colon.
Every hour on the hour I receive the siren
call from the latrine. The last hour just about up.
- If you will excuse me now!
- Have you tried another hospital?
There is no other hospital! Boston Mercy
is the finest in New England!
- I know! I know somebody there.
- Bully for them!
- If you'll excuse me,
I am now in an extreme hurry!
-
What's the matter with you?
You drive this thing like it's a lethal weapon!
Oh, my.
Corpsman!
His tank broke down. When the crew
were repairing it, they were fired on.
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.
- He was the only one who made it
back into the tank.
- Sponge.
- Sponge.
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- I'll suction.
-  Attention all personnel!
We're patched into Armed Forces
Radio for a special broadcast.
It sounds big, folks.
This is Robert Pierpoint
in Seoul.
I've just returned from outside
the newly built conference hall in Panmunjom.
The hall is a symbol
of the renewed hope for peace.
It is almost finished, and you can still smell
the greenness of the wood.
Two years of constant disappointment
have made skeptics of us all.
However, the word
from Panmunjom today...
is that an armistice agreement
may be reached at almost any hour.
While one of the bloodiest
battles of the war rages on...
it seems peace
is finally within our grasp.
Yee-hee!
-
- Shh. Quiet!
...and agreement on a final truce line.
- Shut your traps!
After a week of secret sessions
in Panmunjom...
the Red delegates
have finally announced...
they will discuss preparations for signing
the armistice agreement.
There is certainly some distance
to go in these negotiations...
but for the first time
in over three years...
the end of this bloody road
that we've traveled seems only steps away.
This is Robert Pierpoint
in Seoul.
We return you now to our regular
programming. This is the Armed Forces Network.
-
- ##
Thank you, Dr. Freedman.
I won't require your services anymore.
- Where you headed, soldier?
- The war's coming to an end.
Everybody's on stage
for the finale!
If you don't mind, I'd like to exchange
my straightjacket for something in a 39 normal.
So if you'll call me a taxi,
I'll be on my way.
It's so hard to find a cab
in this part of the war.
Besides, I don't think
you're quite ready to leave.
Sidney, listen to me. I'm a doctor.
There is nothing wrong with me!
That's what you said the night
they brought you here.
You'd just driven your jeep
through the wall of the Officers Club...
and ordered a double bourbon.
That was strange.
I drink martinis.
And that morning, you wanted to operate
on a patient without an anesthetic.
You accused the anesthetist
of trying to smother him with the mask.
Before we call you a cab, I think we have
a little more talking to do.
- Colonel!
- Good morning, Soon-Lee.
- Uh, that man at motor pool
tell me to speak to you.
- He did, huh?
- Yes. I know how to drive jeep.
- Well, good for you.
- He say you give okay, I can have one.
- Whoa, little lady.
- I'm a bit confused here.
- I tell you. I go looking all
over countryside for my parents.
Too much walking.
Jeep is faster, yes?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jeeps are only for people in the army.
But soon it be too late.
I never find them.
Look, I'd like to help. But there are lots of folks
here looking for their families.
The sad fact is we don't have time
to be a missing persons bureau.
- Klinger's lending you a hand, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.
I'm sure he'll do all he can.
Now the best of luck to you.
Just a minute!
You handle our food and dig latrines?
Don't worry, sir. I always wash my hands
before I dig the latrines.
I don't understand why it should take so long
to construct a simple potty shed.
Winchester, you'll just have to use
the ravine latrine like everybody else.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Rome? Rome?
Hey, take it easy.
What's going on here?
This is my mother's shawl! This woman trade
my mother food for it in Chorwon.
Day before yesterday,
my mother was in Chorwon!
- She's alive! She's alive!
-
- Come on.
- Where?
We go call Chorwon.
Maybe my family's still there!
I don't know if we can get through!
Chorwon keeps changing hands!
- We try! Come on!
- Okay, okay. All right! Hey. Hang on a second.
Uh, two bucks
for the shawl.
Four bucks.
Four bucks for the shawl.
Ah, thank you.
Here. Here.
- Here. When we find your mom,
you can give this back to her.
- Thank you.
Come on!
-
- Oh-oh!
I... I am a doctor.
I... I... I am also ill.
I am a doctor and a patient.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'll be right here.
No, no, no!
Now, wait.
Now, don't... Now,
don't you do that! No!
My God,
they're musicians.
Yes. Yes, I see. Now...
- Uh, all right. Shush!
- ##
That... That will be all.
Thank you.
-
- ##
Stay!
Stay!
- ##
-
- ##
- Don't you think a portable
radio would be more convenient?
I believe these gentlemen
have surrendered.
Let's get 'em inside
and process 'em, Corporal.
Come on, boys. Not too much solid food right
away. They probably couldn't hold it down.
I'll make sure the motorcycle
doesn't escape.
Major, I think there's a definite medal
in capturing five Chinese in your bathrobe.
-  Yeah.
-
Now what happened on the bus?
Nothing.
You're wasting your time.
Well, you never know.
What can I tell you?
We were having a great time.
- We were laughing, and we had a bottle.
-
##
Can we please have
that bottle back here?
This guy can't wait!
Where did that soldier
come from?
- He needed the bottle.
- Keep going.
He needed the bottle,
so we gave it to him.
Can we please have this bottle
back here? This guy can't wait!
So he was wounded.
- I guess he was.
- I wonder why you repressed that?
Sergeant, we're looking
for a family named Han.
They're refugees,
originally from Kumwa.
Get off the phone.
I've got to send a telegram.
Uh, tell them my father is
a little man, dark hair.
- Mr. Han is a little man with dark hair.
- Mother is, uh, short, dark hair.
Yeah, right.
The mother also isn't too tall.
- And brother, uh, short, dark hair.
- I think they got the idea.
- Klinger, I want to send a telegram!
- What?
All right, but before you go...
Boy! That one did sound close!
They gotta get out.
They're gonna be overrun any minute.
- Klinger!
- Working on it, Major. Go.
This goes to Robert Harwell, Chairman of the
Board, Mercy Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.
- Dear Uncle Bob.
- Gee, your uncle runs a hospital.
- He's not really my uncle.
- Oh, that kind of uncle. I get it.
He's a friend of the family! I've been calling him
that since I'm a kid. Now be quiet!
- Why did you not tell them about my brother?
- I tried!
- Klinger, pay attention!
- Dear Uncle Bob.
Sergeant, get on the phone
to "l" Corps.
Colonel, please. Have known
Major Winchester two years.
Klinger, I've got North Koreans
up to my southern border,
and I want to get 'em outta here!
- Yes, sir.
- Now they be looking for two people, not three!
- They're not looking for anybody.
They're leaving!
- Will you listen?
Have worked with Major Winchester
two years, stop.
- One of the finest surgeons
I've ever known, stop.
- Stop!
Tell "l" Corps that tank is still sitting out there,
and this is not a parking lot.
His two years here equals 10 years
any stateside hospital.
- Klinger, will you...
- Let me read this.
Don't you have a piece of paper
that proves I'm in charge here?
Colonel, I'm on my way
to the orphanage.
I'm taking them some sulfa,
and I need your initials.
- You know, that tank has...
- And some aspirin.
- And the same goes...
- And, uh, penicillin.
- Padre! We need a few drugs here too!
- Just trying.
- Get on that phone.
- And sign it,
"Love to you and Aunt Betsy, Margaret."
- Margaret!
- It's very hard to think in here with all this noise!
##
What is that atrocious odor?
Yellow.
Well, put the lid on it.
You're distracting me.
Charles, I'd much rather be distracting
my neighbors back in Mill Valley.
My kid has her
second birthday coming up...
and if they don't sign that damn truce,
it'll be the second one I've missed.
- ##
- ##
- ##
- ##
- Silence!
-
Silence!
I want an immediate end
to this hideous caterwauling!
I, uh... Shh.
I am trying to listen
to music on my phonograph.
Yeah. Music, eh?
Do you know what music is?
Oh!
No! No! Stop! Cut!
I am trying to listen
to Mozart.
- Ah. Mo...
- Do you understand?
- Mozart?
- Mozart.
Shh. Mozart.
Attention all personnel! Incoming wounded!
Bring your shoes. This may be
our last dance before we go home!
##
Don't you have somebody else
to talk to?
You know, the guy in the blue robe
out there thinks he's General MacArthur.
If you do a good job on him,
he could probably get you promoted.
You have to catch him in the morning.
In the afternoon, he wades ashore in the bathtub.
You know, people would like you
a lot better if you didn't stare at them.
- The bus.
-
We had to stop the bus
and pick up some refugees.
About half a mile later,
we took on some wounded G.I. 's.
- We got room in the back?
- Yeah. Take 'em in the back.
I'll be right back there.
I gotcha. Just grab that.
I got him. No, I got him.
We gotta get this bus
into the bushes.
There's an enemy patrol coming down
the road. Let's kill those lights.
Quiet! Now nobody make a sound
until they've passed us.
- And then?
- Well, we sat and waited. The evening passed.
This happened. That happened.
And this and that and so.
And so, and so, and so,
and so, and so, and so.
Uh-huh.
Yahoo!
##
- Yeah! ##
- What's gotten into you?
- I'm getting out of here! I'm going home!
- Home?
What are you talking about?
Let me see this.
- ##
- "Captain B. J. Hunnicutt."
"San Francisco."
San Francisco?
- ##
- This doesn't seem possible.
Seems real possible to me.
They wouldn't send one of my surgeons home
and not tell me. This has to be a mistake.
Sure it is. Look. We all make mistakes.
Forgive and forget. That's my motto.
This makes up for the mistake
they made when they drafted me.
Suppose you call "l" Corps
and confirm it?
Suppose we call "l" Corps,
and they deny it?
You're right.
This calls for blind faith and fast feet.
Look, son, nobody likes a good
snafu better than I do...
but this doesn't seem fair
to everyone else.
A lot of these folks have been here
longer than you have.
Colonel, who would mind?
I'll ask. Folks, everybody? Can I have your
attention for just a moment please?
My little daughter... My little daughter, Erin,
is having her second birthday next week.
I haven't seen her since she was just
a little baby. Would you pass that around?
- A few minutes ago, I got orders to go home!
-
Now, I realize that some of you
have been here longer than I have.
If there is no strong objection, it would surely
mean a lot to me and my little girl...
Doesn't she have
a beautiful smile?
If I could be there to
wish her a happy birthday in person.
- So, what do you say?
-
- The vox khaki.
- I can't run a hospital without surgeons.
Who's supposed to replace you?
What would you say if we found
a first-class surgeon to take my place?
- That's fair enough.
- Well...
-
- Come on. Let him try.
- I guess I'd say bon voyage.
-
-
- Everybody, under the tables!
Those P.O.W.'s are locked up
out there like sittin' ducks!
Father, come back here! Father!
Father, come back here!
I got him. Get the rest of
those guys out of here. Corpsman!
Couple more.
Corpsman!
Real gently, get him up.
Easy. Keep him level.
-
-  Doctor!
Till we get that tank out of here, I want
everybody wearing helmets in the compound.
Goldman, get a detail and
start sandbagging this building.
- How is he?
- He's coming around.
It was just a mild concussion
and some skin abrasions.
- I'll know more later.
- Colonel, is everyone all right?
They'll be okay.
You're quite a guy, Padre.
- What did he say?
- He said you're quite a guy.
What?
Why are you both mumbling?
- Turn your head.
- I'm having trouble hearing you.
What's wrong with me?
- Do you have a ringing or a buzzing in your ears?
- Yes, I have.
You may have done some damage
to the inner ear. Tinnitus.
Well, that's not serious, is it?
I won't know till I get you a hearing test,
but I'm concerned.
Why concerned?
If you've damaged the nerve center,
you could lose your hearing.
What I'd like to do is get you down to the evac
hospital for diagnosis and observation.
They wouldn't send me home
because of this, would they?
If it doesn't get better, they might.
It depends how bad it gets.
Listen, there are 40 children
at Sister Theresa's orphanage.
I bring them food and clothing and medicine.
They depend on me.
I know. You're the only
father they've got.
I'm not leaving here if I have
to leave them in the lurch.
I want you to give me your solemn promise
that no one except you will know about this.
Okay, Father. I understand.
This is just between you and me.
- What?
- Yes!
- It's your move.
- I know.
Oh, MacArthur and Truman
are talking again.
Yesterday, he fired him
and sent him home.
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.
- It's against the rules.
- Yeah? Well, I don't like rules.
MacArthur's always
trying to attack China with his king.
- And I don't cheat.
- Yes, you do!
- I don't! And don't say...
-
Shut up! Just be quiet, will you?
Will somebody shut these guys up?
Jensen!
They don't bother me
till they start squawking like chickens.
Not that I have anything against chickens
personally. They're a much maligned bird.
I mean, take the common fallacy that
chickens are afraid.
Who else has the nerve to run around
after you cut their heads off?
Have you ever seen a chicken
break out in a cold sweat?
Have you ever known a chicken
to have a weak handshake?
I mean, I'll grant you,
they're afraid of flying.
In a recent survey, two out of three chickens
preferred to take the bus.
But what about their
contributions to society, hmm?
I mean, just think of
the great chickens of history.
It's hard to think of any,
isn't it?
Chickens take the bus.
As a matter of fact,
there was a chicken on the bus.
Every time it made a noise, I was sure
the Chinese would hear it and find us.
Everybody's life was in danger
because of that damn chicken!
"Paint garage bright yellow."
We haven't heard anything about
a replacement for me yet, have we?
I think the "we" you are referring
to is you and Klinger.
- If you don't know, ask him.
- Right.
Mildred can't wait
for my retirement.
Sent me a whole list of things we can
do together when I get home.
-
- I got a list like that myself.
- You did?
- It's funny. You know what
I'm looking forward to the most?
All the things I used to avoid... Cleaning
the garage, clearing out the rain gutters.
- Yeah. I got that here on Mildred's list.
- Fixing the holes in the screens.
Yep. Right here.
You got clipping the azaleas?
I have to prune
the lemon tree.
You know, to some people, things like that
can sound pretty boring.
Yeah, look at this list.
Not an interesting thing on it!
There was a time when Peg just couldn't get
me involved in that stuff. It didn't seem exciting.
Just one boring thing...
after another.
I tell you. Right now, I feel like I could
do chores like that for the rest of my life.
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna be doin' em
for the rest of my life.
Hmm.
Chorwon is very close.
You get jeep, we be there in one hour.
We be back by dinnertime.
Soon-Lee, we go to Chorwon,
we'll have Chinese food for dinner.
The enemy's all over the place
up there.
- Did you find me a surgeon yet?
- Don't you read the papers?
There's fighting going on.
All the spare doctors are in Kumsong.
Not all of them. I happen to know Artie Jacobson
is sitting around Tokyo with nothing to do.
- Okay, I'll ask him.
- Don't ask him. Tell him. I want to go home.
Boy, what a lucky guy.
I'd give anything to be back in Toledo.
Sitting in Packo's
with the guys...
having a beer and eating a dog while
the chili sauce drips down your arm.
-
-
Course,
this is nice too.
No patrol can find them!
As soon as they fire off three rounds,
they must pack up and move to a new location!
What? Oh, yeah.
I understand, Colonel.
"L" Corps. I am specifically ordered
not to touch that tank...
and it may be days
before the owner comes and gets it.
Why don't you just tell 'em
this is a hospital?
As long as that tank is here,
we're a target!
Boy, you must think
I am the biggest dunce...
since the monkey wrapped his tail
around the flagpole.
Don't you think that's
what I told him?
I can take care of my job.
You go act like a sergeant!
Unless... you want to try
something lower!
Is he any calmer? He was talking
a mile a minute the last time I saw him.
We made progress,
but we're not done yet.
So do you think I should tell him
I'm going home soon? Would that throw him?
Good question.
Why don't you just play it by ear?
Yeah?
- I brought you a present.
- Hi.
Look at you. Just visiting,
or did you get a leak in your beanbag?
- I missed you.
- Yeah, me too.
I have to go read a few inkblots.
I'll see you guys later.
I'd have brought the whole still, but it would
have been tough to sneak past the guards.
Mmm.
- How's work?
- We're keeping busy.
Well, it's a nice location.
You get a lot of drop-in business.
I'll be glad to
give it all up to go home.
What makes you think
you're going home?
Well, you know, eventually.
Someday we're gonna get outta here.
Seems like the whole world
has gone by while we've been here.
You know, Erin's
second birthday's coming up?
Last time I saw her, she was so small,
her hand wouldn't fit around my finger.
She wore these little baby booties
you could fit into a shot glass.
You know, I wear the same boots
I got when I came here.
Yeah. Well, anyway,
I really miss her...
even though just about the only thing
I remember is her big, toothless grin.
Yeah, well, that's the thing, see?
Toothless grin?
Fingers, boots, shot glasses. There's a common
thread running through all of this.
You could've said twine, toothbrushes,
chewing gum under the seat at the theater.
I found chewing gum under the seat
at the Rialto in Kennebunkport.
Charles Boyer was trying to drive
Ingrid Bergman crazy in Gaslight.
The light's going dim!
No, it's not. You're crazy.
Now, she knew she wasn't going crazy.
The audience knew she wasn't going crazy.
And this French guy is trying to have her
put away! Now I'd like to know why!
All right, she had a Swedish accent, but we're
still talking about an American citizen here.
I wanna know where they get
the gall to lock up a surgeon!
And I'm talking about the finest surgeon
you'll ever see.
- Sidney?
- I'll tell you. They're not keeping me here.
There are people I can call, you know...
very highly placed people.
- What's up?
- Oh, hi. We were just talking about you.
I'm sorry if I got you
a little agitated.
I'm not even miffed yet.
You wanna see agitated?
I can be aggravated, infuriated, frustrated,
"vexated" and irritated.
Maybe Hawkeye and I
should talk alone for a while.
Yes, why don't we do that?
Go. What are you
waiting for?
I don't know.
I... I... just thought...
there might be something we wanted to say
to each other before I left.
Tell me next time you see me. I'm not gonna
be here forever. I can guarantee you that!
Yeah.
Well. I'll see you.
You wanna tell me what you
and B. J. Were talking about?
- Same thing he always talks about.
- What's that?
Fingers, smiles, teeth.
- Booties.
- Was there anything about that
you found upsetting?
No. I'll tell you what I find
upsetting is being in here.
I want you to get me out of here!
I don't care how you do it!
You can put me on a plane, on a train,
on a bus, on a slow boat to China.
I'll go out on a mouse-drawn chariot.
I don't care what!
- A bus, huh?
- Again with the bus?
Why don't you subscribe to
Arizona Highways and leave me alone?
It's more fun with you.
Keep that damn chicken quiet!
Then what happened?
Then I went back toward
the front of the bus.
What happened next?
There's something wrong with it.
It stopped making noise.
It just... just stopped.
Sh... She killed it!
She killed it!
She killed the chicken?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I didn't mean for her to kill it.
I did not!
I... I just wanted it
to be quiet!
It was...
It was a baby!
She... She smothered
her own baby!
You son of a bitch.
Why did you make me remember that?
You had to get it
out in the open.
Now we're halfway home.
And then I started thinking.
It's like my Uncle Jameel used to say:
If you wanna hide in the desert,
you gotta look like sand.
I was already asleep. I don't need to hear
a bunch of Lebanese fairy tales.
Sorry to wake you, Colonel, but we could
only do this under the cover of darkness.
Wait a minute, what's this tent doing here
where the... tank used to be?
And to make extra sure,
there's a big red cross on the roof too.
You know, we may just
fool 'em with this.
It's an old Bedouin trick. Back in the old
country, my Uncle Jameel was a camel rustler.
Dear Dad. Sorry I haven't
written for a while...
but I've been on R & R
at this wonderful resort.
We're planning to have
a bridge tournament here...
as soon as we can find somebody
with a full deck.
Dear Dad.
Remember when I was a kid,
you always told me...
if my head wasn't attached
to my shoulders, I'd lose it?
Well...
Dear Dad. For the first time,
I understand what a nervous disorder is...
because it seems
I've got one.
I guess I'll be seeing you soon
since I doubt if they'll let a surgeon operate...
whose cheese has
slipped off his cracker.
- Time to hit the couch?
- Actually, it may be time to hit the road.
How would you feel
about moving on?
You just have the bellhop
bring me my pants, I'll be on my way.
Sidney, it's been a pleasure.
Soon as I get back to Maine...
I'm gonna have a memorial
lobster in your honor, cracked, of course.
How about a little hug
for the road?
I hate to break this to you, but you're not
going home. You're going back to the 4077.
Does this mean
I'm not getting the hug?
You're sending a crazy man back to the place
where he got crazy in the first place?
- Are you out of your mind?
- Look, you know, when a soldier
reacts to the stress of combat...
we get him back to his foxhole
as soon as we can.
We have to get you
right back to the O.R.
Listen, a couple of days ago,
I fell all to pieces in there.
- I thought we had to have more sessions.
- We've had them.
So now you're just
dumping me back there again?
Well, I'm going to drop in on you from time
to time, see how you're doing.
Why don't we compromise? Send me to a foxhole
in Crabapple Cove. You can drop in on me there.
I'm afraid of lobsters.
I'll have the bellhop
bring you your pants.
Hi. Uh, g-good morning. I wonder if I could
lighten your mailbag by one letter.
The name is Winchester,
Charles E.
Sorry, Major. Nobody opens this sack
till I get a receipt from your company clerk.
Oh, now, well, see,
this is a letter from a hospital.
I don't care if it's from Dr. Pepper.
I need a receipt.
Dr... Pepper.
Uh-huh. I can get you on a flight
out ofTokyo to Guam.
From there,
a steamer to Seattle.
Can you get me to Honolulu?
I can hitch a flight from there to San Francisco.
What about that boat from,
uh, Okinawa to Honolulu?
Yeah? Yeah? Kimpo, Okinawa,
Honolulu, San Francisco.
That's it! That's it!
That's the one I want!
But the plane leaves
Kimpo in 40 minutes.
- Got anything else?
- Oh, come on! What is this?
-  I don't care! Be creative!
- There is your company clerk.
- Now can I please have my mail?
- Sign here.
- One second. One second.
- Can you get me to Midway?
Wait a minute.
I'm still working on Honolulu.
Sergeant, come on.
I'm due in Kimpo in 20 minutes.
Kimpo? Wait a minute.
You got room for a passenger?
Yeah, I got room,
but I gotta leave right away.
- You give me 10 minutes,
I'll meet you on the chopper pad.
- Five.
- You got it. Klinger?
- You got it. Kimpo.
- Klinger, sign.
- Corporal, get me that flight from Kimpo.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Five minutes? I haven't got
your replacement yet.
Jacobson's due here first thing in the morning.
This is the only connection I could get.
Oh, what the heck.
Send me a piece
of birthday cake.
Thank you.
- Look, l... This is not the way I wanted to...
- Go! You're fighting the clock.
- Captain, you're on the flight.
I even got you a window seat.
- Oh, Klinger, you're...
- I'm really gonna...
- That's how I feel, sir.
Captain, I'm leaving here at
- Whoo-hoo!
- I gotta leave a note for Hawkeye.
- Give me a piece of paper and a pencil. Charles...
-
- Charles...
- Here you are, sir. Better hurry.
I got the job! Someone on the board
gave me a rousing endorsement.
- Charles, I've got to go.
- Fine, fine. Yes, you do that.
- Thanks, Charles.
-
Yahoo! I'm going home! Bob, I'm going home!
I'm going home!
Kell, I'm goin' home.
I'm goin' home!
Whoo-hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
I'm goin' home!
Hawk...
Uh...
Uh...
- Captain.
- Right, right, right.
Here, uh, throw some of
this stuff in that suitcase for me, will ya?
Get everything in that bag
that you can.
I'll try not to
wrinkle your shorts.
You're leaving
and you didn't say good-bye?
Well, you know how
insensitive I can be.
Hunnicutt, when people share a tent for such
a long time, they can become quite close.
Of course, that didn't
happen in our case.
But there is such a thing
as common courtesy.
Charles, there's a kid in post-op
with a perforated descending colon.
- Check him for fever, okay?
- Certainly. Anything else?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there is.
But I better handle it myself.
- Father! Father! I'm leaving now.
- What? You're leaving?
I've just got a minute.
I want to check your ears before I go.
- What do you hear?
- I hear your watch ticking.
- What do you hear in that ear?
- Same thing, your watch.
Really? I just put it
in my pocket.
Well, in that case, I couldn't hear it
in the other ear, either.
Your hearing is not improving.
I think it's getting worse.
In a few weeks, you may not be able to hear
at all. You gotta go home.
You're going home to your child.
My children are still here.
-
- Let's go, Doc. It's now or never.
- Look, Father...
- Come on. I gotta make it to Kimpo. I can't wait.
I'm coming.
So long, Father.
Good-bye, B. J.
God bless you. And thank you.
Hey, look, put this in the chopper for me,
will you? I'll just be a second.
Margaret, I got a flight
at the last minute. I'm leaving.
Leaving? Now?
Will you talk to Hawkeye for me?
I tried to leave him a note.
- There's just too much to say.
- Oh, l... l...
- I wanted to give you a big send-off.
-
Okay, go!
Colonel? Colonel, this
just came in the mail.
Captain Hunnicutt's
travel orders have been rescinded.
What should I do?
Now what was all that, son?
I couldn't hear you over the chopper.
Nothing, sir.
I guess it's too late now.
By the way, if we get any mail from
"l" Corps, put it on my desk.
- I'll look at it in, oh, an hour or so.
- Right, sir.
-
- Everybody hug a sandbag!
Get out of my way!
-
- I thought you said you had
everything under control?
I did. Even I was fooled by that tent.
I almost delivered mail there.
Well, it didn't fool them.
They know that tank's here someplace.
They ain't seen it driven out in the daytime
and they ain't heard it driven out at night.
Okay, that's three. Get "l" Corps
on the phone. Time to kick some ear.
After that, I want you to send out
this telegram here. There.
Hello, Sparky, get me
headquarters, "l" Corps.
You want to express your gratitude to who...
Dr. Tearbug?
Torborg. It's Dr. Torborg. Chief Administrator,
Boston Mercy Hospital.
- You're kissing up the wrong tree.
- I beg your pardon.
Yeah, "l" Corps? This is MASH 4077.
Tank towing, please.
- This ain't the guy who got you your job.
- And how would you know?
Because Major Houlihan
sent her telegram to a whole other guy.
- What do you mean she sent a telegram?
- Who's this?
Good. Hang on to your treads. Colonel Potter
wants to say a few obscene words to you.
You're on, Colonel! I mean,
she recommended you to her uncle...
- who's not her uncle, but he runs the hospital.
- You mean Dr. Robert Harwell?
- Uncle Bob!
- What?
- What?
- Gee! Don't get so choked up about it.
- You want me to change Tearbug to Uncle Bob?
- How... dare...
- See you at the next shelling.
-
I'm not sure I feel right
about getting back into surgery, Sidney.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
The thought, "What if something
goes wrong?" never occurred to me.
Now I'm thinking that a lot.
Actually, that's a pretty good sign
that you're ready to go back.
I'll see you soon.
So long, guys.
- Good. They made up.
-
- Valentinetti.
- Oh, how about me? Me!
- Robinson.
- Whoo!
- Phipps.
- Oh, good. It's what I've been waiting for.
- Snider.
-
Charles, I just got another letter from my father!
And guess what!
He's lined up an even
better assignment for me.
Listen to this.
He says forget Tokyo.
He knows somebody who can get me assigned
to NATO Headquarters in Belgium.
Isn't that great?
Of course, Dad says
I should write a tactful letter to his friend...
backing out of
the other job in Tokyo.
Hmm. Gee, that's kinda tricky. Maybe you
could help me with that. You're good with words.
Oh, I don't know, Margaret. You don't seem
to have any problem using words.
You know what's funny? I already sent away
for Japanese language records.
And now I'm gonna have to change them
to Flemish.
- What are you doing?
- Packing.
The minute this war is over,
I intend to be ready.
By the way, I believe
you still have my copy...
of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's
Sonnets from the Portuguese.
- Oh, I love it.
- Do you?
Let me count the ways.
I trust I may count
on its return?
- Oh. I sort of thought you hated it.
- I do. I loathe it.
It's romantic drool. A book that could
only be read in a bad painting.
- But you want it back.
- Well, it is a volume three of a four-volume set.
Without volume three, the set would have
all the charm of a smile with a missing tooth.
I would have returned it
to you sooner, Charles...
but the book has come to
mean an awful lot to me.
Oh, well, Margaret, I'm sure you'll find
something else that moves you just as much.
The literary world is filled
with romantic claptrap.
I'll get it right back to you, Charles.
Maybe I'm better off without it.
Being sentimental can lead you to do
things that you later regret.
-
-
Soon-Lee?
- Soon-Lee?
-
What? Uh, I am looking
for Soon-Lee.
She's gone?
S-Soon-Lee is gone?
- She... She didn't go to Chorwon?
She could get killed. Chorwon?
-
All right, look, okay. Okay, th-thanks.
Thanks anyway, all right?
- Uh...
- Huh?
Oh, yeah, sure. Here, you take it.
And take this too.
-
- Enjoy. Enjoy.
Uh, gentlemen, uh, one bar before, uh, 120.
Ready? Four for nothing.
One, two, three and...
##
##
Wait. No, no, no.
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Dolce. Dolce.
- Dolce.
-
Espressivo.
Uh, here.
##
Just like that. See, gently, softly, sweetly.
##
- Dolce. And...
- Here's your book. Stick it in your shelf.
- I happen to be rehearsing here.
- You also happen to be self-centered...
- inconsiderate and ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?
I just heard from Klinger
you got the position you wanted in Boston.
- Did you?
- I did.
He also told me that you knew I sent
a telegram to my Uncle Bob.
- Did he?
- He did.
And you knew that when you asked me
to return that book?
- Indeed, I did.
- How could you when you knew
I got you that job?
- You did not get me that job.
- I helped.
Margaret, I happen...
I happen to have a reputation.
I have a certain standing
in the medical profession.
I do not need the help
of a nurse.
Oh, you're... It's a good thing I'm a lady
or you'd need a nurse, buster.
I should have known better than to help
somebody who has no regard for other people!
- I have no regard for other people?
- No! None! None!
You play your records all night!
I hear them halfway across the compound!
I got down on my knees in O.R.
And I scraped plaster off the floor.
- Right!
- Did I get any thanks?
Thanks? Why should I thank you? You were
the one who put it there in the first place!
What about the time you went to Tokyo,
I had to deliver your lecture for you?
- Was that being ungrateful?
- You wouldn't do it for me...
unless I promised I would buy
a record by that Schnabel guy.
You still owe me
that record!
You happen to be very,
very insensitive, Margaret.
You walk into O.R. Wearing so much perfume
that the patients don't need anaesthesia!
- I am a complete professional in O.R.
- Oh.
Unlike some people I know
who do not know how to obey...
the slightest rules
of maintaining sterility.
- Oh, no, you don't.
We settled that a long time ago.
- I know what I saw!
- You saw nothing because that did not happen!
- You touched your nose!
- You couldn't keep your hands off of it!
- I did not touch my nose!
- You are obsessed with your nose!
You have a nasal obsession!
- Just a minute!
In the middle of an operation, you rubbed your
nose like it was some kind of good luck charm!
I do not rub on my nose!
- Look at it sometimes!
It's covered with fingerprints!
- ##
You're in love with your nose! Do you put it
in dresses and take it out to bars, huh?
How dare you!
Quiet!
Looks like it'll all be over
before too long, huh, Captain?
- Not a century too soon.
- Hey, look at that.
"Hawk was gone,
now he's here.
Dance till dawn, give a cheer.
Burma Shave. "
- Pull over! Pull over!
-
Pierce, good to see you.
Why don't you start on the bus?
- Yeah, okay.
- You feel up to it?
- Yeah, sure.
- Good. It's a hell of a load
for me and Winchester.
- Where's B. J.?
- You just missed him. He went home.
Go ahead.
You got customers.
Did you call for a litter?
Can we have some help with the ambulance?
Get thosejeeps
moved out ofhere. We got no room.
Help! Help!
-
- Nurse, please.
I know you're suffering.
I'll help you right after...
All right, get some bandages over here!
-  Hang in there.
-  I need a corpsman
to take this out ofhere.
Jacobson was supposed to
be here yesterday. Where is he?
What do you mean
you rescinded his orders?
I told you Hunnicutt
left the country.
Listen, I am talking
to you from my O.R.
I need a surgeon so bad
I don't have time to leave the room...
to tell you how bad
I need a surgeon!
There are skirmishes
all over the place.
We're working on boys right now
who have retaken Chorwon...
four times
in the past couple of days.
Good. You do that.
I'm done, Klinger.
Slam down the phone for me.
They're gonna do
what they can.
- Doctor, he's under.
- Yeah, right.
- How are you doing?
- Fine. What could be wrong?
I'm about to stick my hands into a kid whose
insides look like a raw meat loaf...
I just found out my best friend went home
without leaving me so much as a note.
He really felt
bad about that.
Trapper left without leaving a note too.
Is it the war that stinks or me?
- How you doing, Pierce?
- Swimmingly.
Can I get you an instrument?
Yeah. That would be
a good way to start.
Scalpel.
Scalpel.
You and I have
something in common.
I just had my head in a cast.
Are there any more out there?
- He's the last one. After this, we can take a break.
- Okay.
- Get him in this wheelchair.
- Hey, buddy, you came from Chorwon?
- Yeah. Why?
- Our side's got it now, right?
- Yeah. For now.
- Did you see a Korean woman there?
Short? Dark hair?
- You're kidding, right?
- I'm never gonna find out this way.
Okay, get him into post-op.
See you later.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- You holding up okay?
- All things considered...
- Most things considered.
- There are double sandbags in O.R. Come on.
-
- Klinger!
- Klinger, what are you doin'?
- I'm taking a ride in the countryside.
You can't take that unless I sign you out!
They'll bust me right down to my socks!
- Then come over here and sign me out!
-
Have a nice trip.
Okay, that's three.
Let's see if there's any damage.
-
-
That was a hell of a short intermission.
I didn't even have time to buy an orange drink.
I'm looking for the Han family.
Han!
Soon-Lee!
Anybody recognize
that name? Soon-Lee.
Soon-Lee?
I thought we had a system here.
They fire three rounds and they move on.
Wait a minute. What happened to that pattern
they had of firing off three rounds...
- and then going away?
- Good question... again.
Aren't those idiots
afraid of being spotted?
I guess they figure
the tank's worth the risk.
- Or maybe they brought in
a second mortar squad.
-
- Or maybe a third.
- Well, the "mortar" merrier.
Don't you know you could
get killed up here?
So could you too.
Why you come here? You go back.
I look for my parents.
I can take care of myself.
Every day I see them carry in people who
can take care of themselves.
- I'm not gonna let that happen to you.
-
Soon-Lee, please, come back
to the camp with me. Please.
I go look in Sibyon-ni.
They may be there.
When I figured out you came up here,
l... I realized I might never see you again.
And it felt like someone
kicked me in the stomach.
I guess for you worrying about your folks
must be a 24-hour kick in the stomach.
I'll take you to Sibyon-ni.
We'll look together.
No. The shelling
is even worse there.
I couldn't let you go without me.
You could get hurt. Come on.
- No. I not let you come with me.
- Why?
I not want to lose you too.
-
- I promise you we'll find them.
I'll call everywhere.
I promise.
Okay, boys and girls, time
to do something intelligent.
Since I seem to be the only
intelligent person here, I nominate me.
- All in favor, say aye.
- Take your seat, Pierce.
Uh-uh. Sorry. Sorry. I can take umbrage,
I can take the cake...
I can take the "A" train,
I can take two and call me in the morning...
but I cannot take this
sitting down.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna take five.
-  Pierce!
- Hey!
- Pierce, come back here!
- Pierce!
-  Pierce!
-  Hawkeye!
- What's the matter with you?
- Right now! Come back here!
-
- What is he... What is he doing?
-  Pierce, what do you think you're...
-  What's the matter...
- Pierce!
- Pierce!
He can't drive that.
Does anybody know if...
Pierce, stop it!
Stop it! Pierce!
- Oh, no, no, no! Turn left!
- No! No! No!
-
-  Hey, we're saved!
I don't know why
I always have to take out the trash.
-
- Whoo!
I wonder if his discharge from the hospital
was a bit premature?
I'm putting in a call
to Sidney.
Well, Soph, I think it's
safe for you to come back now.
We kept your room
just the way you left it.
Looks like it's really
gonna be over soon.
Sophie, this ain't easy
for me to tell ya...
but I can't take you
home with me.
I sure will miss you.
And I have a feeling
you'll miss me too, won't ya?
I guess we'll both be
homebodies from now on.
I'll be weeding
Mildred's nasturtiums...
you'll probably wind up
dragging some farmer's plow.
Well, that's good,
solid work.
I'm sure you'll get
plenty of love.
Just don't look for
a lot of excitement.
Colonel, look at
that sunset.
What a beautiful ending
for a beautiful day.
- Yeah, it'd be a nice sunset
if it was setting over there.
- What do you mean?
Ever since I've been around,
the sun's always set in the west.
- Then what's that?
- Once saw that same kind of glow
in the Ardennes forest.
Next day there wasn't
any forest left.
You better get on the phone
to "l" Corps.
If that fire is headed this way,
we're headed out.
It was started
by incendiary bombs.
It's coming straight at us.
Bug out!
All personnel, bug out!
Get those wounded
on the bus!
Bring that truck over here
for the P.O.W.'s!
And I need a vehicle for the refugees!
We're taking them with us!
Come on!
Snap into it!
Come on! Come on! Come on! Easy! Easy!
Watch it! Watch it!
Careful! Careful! Careful!
Put him down! Put him down!
All right! Come on, go, go!
Come on, go!
Well, it's about time.
Did you catch the guy's name?
No. All they said was your new surgeon
will be coming in on the evac chopper.
I hope he's got fast hands.
I got as far as Guam and all flights
are canceled. Nothing going in or out.
I'm sitting there in this crummy officers club
and this guy comes up to me and says...
"You Hunnicutt the doctor?"
Now, I didn't like the sound of that, so I said...
"No, not me, pal.
I'm Hunnicutt the chaplain."
He says, "Well, Chaplain, you better start
praying for a miracle...
because you're going back
to Korea to do surgery."
I was a third
of the way home.
When I was screaming for a surgeon,
I sure didn't think they were gonna dig you up.
Yeah.
Hey, you're looking a lot better
than the last time I saw you.
- How you feeling?
- In the pink.
Uh, I wanted to leave you a note before I left.
I just didn't have the time.
I didn't even know you were gone.
I thought you were in the bathroom.
- Sure is great to be back. Where is this anyway?
- ##
No, no, no, no! Hey, hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!
- Dolce! Ohh! Dolce!
-
Dolce!
The Chinese have been torturing Winchester
for a week now.
##
Soon-Lee?
Max.
I called Sibyon-ni,
and they haven't see 'em.
- But I'll try the towns around there next.
- Oh, thank you, Max.
Listen, remember how I told you I used to wear
dresses to try to get out of the army?
- Yes.
- Well, I saved a couple. I... I brought one over.
Oh, good. I always wanted
to see you in one.
- Ah.
-
This is kind of
a special dress.
I'd kind of like to
see you in it.
Y-You want me
to wear funeral dress?
Oh, no.
See, in America,
white is for weddings.
Oh, Max.
I love you, Soon-Lee.
Will you marry me?
- Yes.
- Ohh!
That's great.
You'll love my folks.
And they'll be
nuts about you.
We'll throw a wedding
that'll run for a week.
It'll be the first one Toledo ever had in English,
Korean and Lebanese.
Max, l... I cannot leave Korea
until first I find my family.
That could take months,
years.
I got to find them,
no matter how long it takes.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Three-legged races, ball games,
maybe get a barbecue going.
I'djust love to get those children
out of the orphanage for a few hours.
- Yeah, I know. It's great.
- What?
- Great.
- Yeah.
Boy, how do you do it? Nobody seems
to know you can't hear except me.
Well, I hear bits and pieces,
and for the rest of it, I nod a lot.
- Mmm. It must be tough.
- Huh?
- Just nod, Father.
- Mmm.
Come on, kick it, kick it, kick it!
That was wonderful!
That was great! We won!
Sidney, welcome! Isn't this wonderful?
Just look at those glowing faces!
- Not to mention yours.
- Uh-huh.
- B. J.
- Hey, Sid. Get your red-hot hot dogs.
Folks, can I have your attention?
I need Captain Hunnicutt.
Would the hot dog man
please get his buns over here?
-  What's going on?
-  Get over there.
Now, as you all know, Hunnicutt would
rather be back in the states...
celebrating his daughter
Erin's birthday.
Well, we thought we might
be able to do something by proxy.
As it turns out,
little Kim here...
has the same birthday
as Erin Hunnicutt.
-  Hi.
- So, look at this.
Oh! Beautiful! Do you want to blow out
some candles? Here we go.
This is great. Where'd you find a kid
with the same birthday as Erin?
Well, we didn't really.
The aren't any records
on most of these kids.
With so many of them, we don't know who
their parents were or where they come from.
So we just decided to find
a little girl who was about two years old...
and make it her day.
We don't really know
when she was born.
What better birthday present
to get than your own birthday.
Hi, sailor.
Hi. I saw you come in.
Does the fact that you're here
mean I'm not all there?
I heard you took
a tank for a spin.
Everybody was getting shelled on account
of that tank, and I got rid of it.
You call that crazy?
Actually, that might have been
the sensible thing to do.
But I am curious about why
you walked away from that kid just now.
Yeah, well, maybe
you got me there.
I was looking at her and all of a sudden
I noticed...
I had a butterfly collection
loose in my stomach.
Being around little kids
makes me uncomfortable these days.
- I guess that's something we have to work on.
- Mmm.
What else have you
been going through?
Yesterday, I spent a year
in the operating room.
I was up to my ankles
in panic.
I'm a little out of control, Sidney.
Surgery used to be
like falling of a log.
Now it's more like
falling off a cliff.
You know, just because you're a doctor
doesn't mean you're supposed to be perfect.
- Your patients aren't.
- Yeah.
They have pain,
they're afraid.
Actually, they're probably
better off if you know how they feel.
Might make being a surgeon
a little harder...
but it might make you
a better doctor.
Well, anyway, that's
something to think about.
- I can't sleep.
- Well, then you should take something.
No. If I sleep,
then I talk.
If I don't talk, I think. I think too fast.
If I could just slow down my thinking.
I just think too fast,
that's all.
I don't think we have to
make a big deal out of this, you know?
So I think too fast
and I'm afraid of children.
That's... That's not...
That's not terrible.
-
-
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Where are you taking these people?
I gotta get 'em to a relocation center,
Major. By the line.
As soon as the truce is signed,
these guys gotta be ready
for the big switch.
- We're swapping their prisoners for ours.
- Yes.
Fine. Just leave me five of them.
Him, him, him, him and, uh, him.
Sorry, Major.
They all go.
Well, you can't! Not yet!
I've come too close to stop now.
- Okay, move out!
-
##
Ladies and gentlemen...
five minutes ago
at 10.01 this morning...
the truce was signed
in Panmunjom.
The hostilities will end
- The war is over!
-
Yea, the war is over! Yea, the war is over!
Move over! Get over!
Come on! This way!
Bring them this way.
We've got wounded here.
Give me that flask.
Quickly.
Here.
Here you go.
All right, listen up!
We operate on the ones
that can't wait.
Those that can wait,
we take 'em with us.
"L" Corps wants us back
in Ouijongbu right away.
- Hunnicutt, take a look at that boy over there.
- All right.
Corpsman!
- Does this look like peace to you?
-
Get him up.
Corpsman!
Oh... gee.
Okay, let's get to work.
Let's start cleaning up.
- I've got fresh sponges.
- Put 'em down right there.
It is now 2:00 p.m.
In exactly eight hours,
the Korean War will be officially over.
- It's a time for summing up...
- Suture.
And these are the most up-to-date
figures we have.
The cost of the war to the United States
has been placed at $22 billion.
-
- Don't look at me. I only get 300 a month.
In human terms, the cost was much greater.
The U.N. Forces have suffered
the following casualties.
- Make that 250,001.
-  And two.
-  Three.
-  Four.
And there's 12 more
out in the hall.
On the communist side...
were killed or wounded.
The war also killed
This is not a good place to have a career
as an innocent bystander.
If you add it all up, it comes to more than
Now that's what I call
a grand total.
In addition, one fourth
of all Koreans are homeless...
What did he say?
How many orphans?
Dear God.
Sir.
Can I ask you something
of a personal nature?
Well, in another minute,
I gotta go back in and pick up my scalpel.
Do you understand women?
Oh, what I understand about women
will take a lot less than a minute.
I thought when the war was over,
it'd be the happiest day of my life.
But everything's
all messed up.
Now I'm in love, and I got
nothin' but trouble.
Listen, when you're in love,
you're always in trouble.
There's only two things
you can do about it.
Either stop lovin' 'em
or love 'em a whole lot more.
But if you love 'em
a whole lot more...
won't that just get you
a lot more trouble?
Yup. Then you
love 'em even more.
Boy, that sounds tough.
It's murder.
A big glass of fresh,
ice-cold milk.
Ooh!
For me, a banana.
And, of course...
what's a banana without
a piece of chocolate cake?
-
- What are you laughing at? It's wonderful.
It is. It's delicious. I'm gonna take
a three-hour bubble bath.
-  Oh, yeah.
- How about you, Colonel?
- What's the first thing you want
when you get home?
- Well, I like fresh corn.
I mean, real fresh corn.
So I think maybe I'll just take a hot plate out
to the garden, make a pot of boiling water.
Then I won't even
pick that corn.
I'll bend that stalk,
till the ear dips into the water...
and I'll eat it
right there standin' up.
Scrumptious!
How about you, Charles?
What are you looking forward to?
I am looking forward
to a hemostat.
Hemostat. There's no need
to bite my head off.
- Sponge.
- Sponge.
You know, I just don't see why
some people can't be grateful...
if other people
try to help them.
- Don't you?
- I think a person is lucky if
somebody cares enough to help.
Where would I be without
my father's help?
Where indeed? He's pulling you
in three different directions.
If you get any luckier, there's gonna be
a piece of you in every corner of the world.
Maybe some people
just can't feel gratitude.
Maybe some people like having
other people run their lives.
But some people don't.
But although we are well past
the halfway point in these final 12 hours...
both sides continue heavy
artillery shelling.
- Further bulletins as they arrive.
- ##
- Want a sandwich?
- What's in it?
Let's see.
Cucumbers, watercress,
a little French mayonnaise.
- Is the crust cut off?
- No.
Forget it.
I tell you, one thing I'm not
gonna miss is bologna.
Or standing in line
to take a cold shower.
I'm not gonna
miss that either.
How about you?
What are you not gonna miss?
Lice...
dysentery...
rats.
There's nothing here
I'm gonna miss...
except you.
Yeah, well, we'll get
to see each other.
How? You'll be on one coast
and I'll be on the other.
Letters, phone calls.
Maybe a surgical convention.
- ##
- Can you picture either one of us
at a convention?
No, I guess not.
We'll never
see each other again.
- Look, one year Erin and Peg and I'll come east.
- One year.
Yeah, and, um...
And we'll get together and, um...
- Have dinner.
- Yeah.
In other words, good-bye.
- It's not good-bye.
- It is good-bye. What's the big deal?
- Just say good-bye.
- What do you want me to say it for?
It shows you know I'm going.
What would you do if I was dying?
Hold me and let me die in your arms
or just let me lay there and bleed?
What are you talking about?
You're not dying. You don't even have a cold.
- Come on. Just a little "so long."
- I'm gonna get back to the O.R.
Good-bye.
President Eisenhower is expected to ask for...
an emergency relief fund of $200 million
to rebuild the war-torn Korean economy.
Another 200 million may be allocated for
the reinforcement of the Vietnam army...
in its war against communism
in Southeast Asia.
It is now three hours before
the cessation ofhostilities.
- Vietnam, where's that?
- Southeast Asia, he said.
Sorry to interrupt your peace bulletin, folks...
but we got wounded
in the compound.
We need a surgeon
for triage.
- Looks like it's all over but the shooting.
- Who's free?
I'll go.
That is, if it's all right with you.
-
-
All right.
We'll take him second.
- What else you got?
- This P.O.W. Over here.
He was in the back of the truck
when it was hit.
Half his chest is gone.
Does he even have a pulse?
Is there anything we can
do for him, Doctor?
Doctor?
He wasn't even a soldier.
He was a musician.
What happened to the other people
in the truck with him?
He's the only one
that made it this far.
Major, we have to prep
the others.
Why don't you
take a break?
- Okay.
-
Come on! Hurry up!
He's still bleeding. Come on.
Watch your back, Lieutenant.
-  Compound fracture!
-  I lost him.
##
##
-
-
Hey, wake up, will ya!
Better pay attention, Father.
You wanna go home in one piece.
Dear Lord...
I know there must be
a reason for this.
But what is it?
I answered the call
to do your work.
I've devoted my life to it, and
now how am I supposed to do it?
Lord, what good am I now?
What good is a deaf priest?
I've prayed
to you to help me...
and every day I get worse.
Are you deaf too?
Okay, I'm done here.
Give me another body.
Somebody got a gown
and some gloves?
- How you doin', Doc?
- I'm just barely getting through it.
Congratulations.
Who could hope for more?
- Comin' in.
-  Got it. He's right here.
Oh, my God.
She was thrown into a ditch
during the shelling.
She can't be more than
eight years old.
-  Pressure's dropping.
-  Over here.
Pierce.
You wanna switch with me?
I'll take her.
No, I'll take her.
Sidney.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Well, if you folks can spare me, I'll be going.
I think there are places I can be of more use.
I'd give you that hug now,
but I'm, uh, kind of busy.
That's okay.
Save it for her.
- See you.
-  Bye, Doctor.
-  Take it easy.
-  So long, Sidney.
You know, I told you people
something a long time ago...
and it's just as pertinent
today as it was then.
Ladies and gentlemen,
take my advice...
pull down your pants
and slide on the ice.
This is Robert Pierpoint
speaking to you from Panmunjom.
It's one minute
before 10:00 p.m.
We can still hear the sound
of nearby artillery.
At some point during the next few seconds,
the guns should go silent...
as the cease-fire officially
goes into effect.
There it is. That's the sound of peace.
Scalpel.
Can we have some more hemostats, please?
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
I'm so glad.
##
- ##
-
I'm still your C.O.
For a few more hours...
- so when I go like this...
-
- You go like this.
-
Now, you wanna
take your seats, please.
Tomorrow the tents of the 4077
will be coming down...
for good.
Uh, for an awful long time...
we've been living together,
eating together...
-  Sleeping together.
-
Well, I wouldn't know.
I have a horse.
Anyway, since this is
our last evening together...
I've been wondering what
your lives will be like when all this is over.
I thought it might be a good idea
for each one of us to get up...
and tell everybody what
we'll be doing next.
- You ought to go first, Colonel. Huh?
-  Yes.
Well...
there's a woman
back in Hannibal, Missouri...
who's spent the better part
of 30 years...
waiting for me to come home from
one tour of duty or another.
She's had to learn to do
an awful lot on her own.
Now I'm going home to see
if she can show me...
how to do it with her.
So, uh, part of the time,
I'll be a semi-retired country doctor...
but, uh, most of the time...
I'll be Mrs. Potter's
Mr. Potter.
-  Aw, that's nice.
-
All right, who's next?
- Me, me.
-
Well, I put in to be assigned
to Tripler Army Hospital in Honolulu...
to be with my family who l...
I really miss.
And I just wanna say that l...
I love you all.
- Well, um, I don't love you all.
-
Some of you still owe me money.
Which I really need it...
'cause I plan to open up a business when
I get back to Louisiana.
Big money in this.
I'm gonna breed frogs
for French restaurants.
- Here, go buy yourself a frog.
-
When I, uh, graduated
from medical school...
I couldn't wait for the, uh...
the action of a big city hospital.
But now I'm not so sure action's
all it's cracked up to be.
- In fact, neither is cracking up.
-
So I think I'd like
to take it easy for a while.
I don't wanna just have a bunch of anonymous
patients parade through my office.
I'd like to maybe, uh...
talk with them for a few minutes
and get to know who they are.
So I think, for now,
I'll be very happy just, uh...
- getting Crabapple Cove to say ah.
-
And I can't say that
I've loved you all either.
But I've loved
as many of you as I could.
I'm goin' back to Colorado.
My father-in-law's got a ranch there.
I wanna see if I can
get into radiology.
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.
-
Well, as you know, I was all set to go back
to Mill Valley to Peg and Erin and all that...
but I'll tell you,
I had the best time on Guam.
I met this cookie at the airport bar
and she begged me to run off with her.
And I figured, what the hell?
You only live once, you know?
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding. Just kidding.
He's just kidding.
That's all.
I'm gonna do something where
people don't yell at me...
when I put the food down
in front of'em.
I'm gonna be a pig farmer.
What do you mean "gonna be"?
Well, l... I was a nurse
at the tail end of World War II.
And now this.
And...
you wanna know something?
I've had it.
I was anxious to get back
to being in a parish...
- and coaching boxing for the C.Y.O.
-
But lately, I've gotten kind of interested
in working with the deaf.
Of course, not doing parish work,
I'll miss hearing confession.
But after listening
to you people for so long...
- I think I've just about heard it all.
-
- I'm gonna stick with the army.
- I'd really like to live in Washington.
I'm gonna see if I can
work at Walter Reed.
What about you, Winchester?
Well, I'm gonna be, uh...
head of thoracic surgery
at Boston Mercy Hospital.
So my life will go on
pretty much as I expected.
With one exception.
For me, music was
always a refuge...
from this
miserable experience.
And now it will
always be a reminder.
So I'm going to
stay in nursing...
but I wanna be in maternity
or pediatrics.
After all this, I think it would be nice to help
bring people into the world.
I wanna be an officer,
so I'm gonna try and get into O.C.S.
Then I'm gonna be the best darn
nurse Oklahoma's ever seen.
Well,
for the next few days...
I'll be helping with the consolidation
of the 8063rd.
And then after
a little furlough...
I'll be going on
to my next assignment.
- Tokyo, right?
- Wrong. Belgium.
You're both wrong.
I've always looked
to my father for guidance.
When he makes up his mind
about something...
he does it no matter
what anybody says.
And that's
what I'm gonna do.
What I've wanted
to do all along...
work in the states
in a hospital.
There's a lot of
my father in me.
It's never been his way to tell
people how he feels about them.
So I guess that's why...
I never told
my nursing staff...
what I told other people
about you.
It's been an honor and a privilege
to have worked with you.
And I'm very, very proud...
to have known you.
I planned something,
but it kind of fell through.
- I guess you notice Soon-Lee isn't here tonight.
-  Yeah.
It's because she had a lot of
things to take care of...
'cause we've decided
to get married.
- Congratulations!
- I had to cut through a lot of red tape...
but I got permission.
The only problem is, she won't leave Korea
until she finds her family.
So... Boy, I don't believe
I'm sayin' this.
I'm stayin' in Korea.
You don't have to act crazy now.
We're all getting out.
Here's how I figure it.
If you love somebody,
you got nothin' but trouble.
So you either
stop lovin' em...
or you love 'em
a whole lot more.
You know,
that's very profound.
But the first thing I'm gonna do
is have a wedding ceremony with my family.
- I thought you weren't going back to Toledo.
- No, I mean with this family.
With you guys. We can do it tomorrow
before everybody goes.
Colonel, would you
be our best man?
I'd be honored, son.
Here's to the happy couple.
May they have a long,
wonderful life...
filled with love and peace.
And so may we all.
-  Here, here.
-  Amen.
Because the best of marriages
are always founded on true friendship...
and the fact that this is only
the first of two ceremonies...
is a symbol, I think,
of the respect...
that you have for your families
and for each other.
I hope you will cherish and hold on
to that respect throughout your lives.
It will be your bond
and your freedom.
- Can we have the ring, please?
- Oh. Comin' right up.
Do you, Soon-Lee, take Maxwell
to be your lawfully wedded husband...
to have and to hold
from this day forward...
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?
I do.
And do you, Maxwell...
take Soon-Lee to be your
lawfully wedded wife...
to love, honor and cherish...
to have and to hold
from this day forward...
- You bet I do.
-
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.
Max, Max,
your limo's waiting.
Oh, yeah, right.
Soon-Lee, our limo.
Thank you, everybody.
##
- Good luck to all of you.
- Good luck to you.
Write sometime.
I'll be lookin' forward to it.
##
Thanks for your help,
Father.
Francis John Patrick Mulcahy. Remember that
if you name any children after me.
I hope you find
your family very soon.
Thank you.
Well, good-bye, Klinger.
I know there have been times when I've yelled
at you and called you names.
It's all right, Major.
I know you didn't mean it.
Oh, well,
I wouldn't go that far.
I know you didn't mean
that either.
So long, Major.
Max, in years to come,
when I tell Erin about all this...
there are some things
she's just not gonna believe.
So, uh, would you
autograph this for me?
Ah, it's one
of my favorites.
I was always a sucker
for crinolines.
I hope I get to come to your wedding.
- Take it easy.
- Okay, sir.
Klinger, with your penchant
for scams, I have no doubt...
that in no time at all,
you will own this country.
And you can have it.
Thanks, Major.
If I'm ever in Beantown, I'll look you up.
Oh, gee. Unfortunately, uh,
I'll be out of town then.
Uh-huh.
So long, kiddo.
I'm gonna miss you.
Me too, Captain.
I'm sure glad you're feelin' okay now.
Couldn't be better.
Honk, honk!
- You have to have that tuned.
-
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye, son.
Take care of yourself.
I hope she finds her family.
-  Good-bye!
-  I'll miss you!
- Come on! Throw the bouquet!
- Throw the bouquet!
-  Bye!
- Oh, look at that.
Wait a minute.
I'm taking my hometown home. Come on.
I got it!
Honolulu!
Let me have Coney Island!
Bye! Bye-bye!
Father, I saved you a spot next to
the ambulance driver. It's pullin' out.
And I got a jeep right over here
for Major Houlihan and Major Winchester.
You know, Father...
the first time I met you, I thought,
"Here's this nice decent guy.
"Kind of sweet and gentle,
you know?
How's he ever gonna last
out here?"
I gotta tell you, you're just
about the toughest bird I know.
Well, I'm certainly a lot luckier than some
of the people we've seen come through here.
- Father, I'll see you at the 8063rd.
- Uh, what?
Well, good-bye, Father.
I must say, you have made
this hellhole a trifle less unbearable.
It certainly is.
What?
What?
So long, Francis.
You've been a godsend.
Well, look on
the bright side.
When they tell us we have to
do time in purgatory...
we can all say,
"No, thanks.
I've done mine."
Sherman.
Father, I may never see you
again, and before you go...
there's something I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time.
- Your shirt's on backwards.
- Uh.
-
-
Good-bye, everybody.
I'll pray for you.
- Okay, Major, pile on.
- As what? A hood ornament?
I'm sorry, Major.
The rest of this stuff can go on the truck.
I'll catch up with it.
No, Margaret. Margaret,
you stay with your belongings.
If you leave them with the army,
you'll never see them again.
You go ahead.
Go in the jeep.
I'm sure Sergeant Rizzo
will find me another mode.
Well, I'll go take a look, but we ain't got
too many modes left, Major.
Hmm. Actually, uh, Margaret,
I'm taking too many things myself.
I wonder if you would tuck
one more item in with you.
Thank you, Charles.
Thank you, Margaret.
Hold on to that arm, Charles.
We want to kiss it too.
You take the arm.
I got dibs on what's left.
- So long, Margaret.
- I hope someday I find someone like you.
I hope so too.
You deserve the best.
Good-bye, Margaret.
I know you've got
your career in order...
but don't forget to have
a happy life too.
You're a dear, sweet man.
I'll never forget you.
So, uh, listen...
Yeah.
- Well, so long.
- See you.
Timber!
How I wish I could
have swung the ax.
Just think of all the rats
who are homeless now.
Oh, don't worry. You'll find somewhere to go.
Excuse me, Major.
I got some transportation for you...
but it ain't
exactly a sedan.
- As long as it's got wheels.
- Oh, what a sport.
So long, Major.
You can be proud of the work you've done here.
You're a fine surgeon.
Well, thank you, sir.
As are you.
Shortly, I will be in a position of authority
over other surgeons...
and I hope I will be guided
by the memory of your wisdom...
and your gentle good humor.
Well, that's very
kind of you, Charles.
I'm sure you've got an even
bigger compliment for me, Charles...
- but let's not get gooey.
- I want to thank you both.
You have made me realize what
going home is all about.
Major, I hope you don't mind
ridin'in a garbage truck...
but it's the last
vehicle I got.
Not at all. What better way to
leave a garbage dump?
Don't slip. There's gunk on
these runnin' boards.
Gentlemen.
So, how are you gettin'
out of here, Colonel?
Oh, I've got my transportation
over yonder.
There's a jeep meeting me
at the orphanage.
I'll take one last
ride on Sophie.
Then, at the padre's request,
I'm givin' her to the orphans.
They can use her for farming
and maybe take her for a ride now and then.
She's real good with kids.
Well, boys, it would be hard to call
what we've been through fun...
but I'm sure glad we went
through it together.
You boys always managed to give me a good
laugh right when I needed it most.
Never forget the time you dropped
Winchester's drawers in the O.R.
Of course I had to pretend
I was mad at you, but...
inside I was laughin'
to beat all hell.
Yeah, I'm laughing
just thinking about it.
I love a good laugh
like this.
I better get out of here.
Colonel, before you go...
We've been thinking about it, and there's
a little something we'd like to give you.
It's not much,
but it comes from the heart.
- Sounds like my cab is here.
- Yeah.
- So...
-
Come on.
I'll give you a ride up there.
Look, I know how tough it is
for you to say good-bye, so I'll say it.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we will see each other again.
But just in case we don't...
I want you to know how much
you've meant to me.
I'll never be able
to shake you.
Whenever I see a big pair of feet
or a cheesy mustache, I'll think of you.
Whenever I smell month-old socks,
I'll think of you.
And the next time somebody
nails my shoe to the floor.
And when somebody gives me
a martini that tastes like lighter fluid.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you... a lot.
I can't imagine what this place would have
been like if I hadn't found you here.
I'll see you back in the states.
I promise.
But, just in case,
I left you a note.
What?
