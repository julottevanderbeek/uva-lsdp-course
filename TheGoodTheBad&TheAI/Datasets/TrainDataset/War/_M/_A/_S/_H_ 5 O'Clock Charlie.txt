- Hold on, just a second, just a second.
- How much?
Gimme the money.
Okay, you got it.
All right, fine.
Do you have a bet? All right.
Okay. Hold it.
I'll give you... Okay.
Try to feel compassionate.
Remember, even one of our saints
received a "DearJohn" letter.
Has anyone picked 40 yards, Radar?
- Uh, oh, no, Father. It's still open.
- Good, good.
If I'm lucky,
the proceeds go to the Bible fund.
Oh, me too.
I say, Reggie, you come here often?
- Only when my horse is running.
- Rather!
Ah, our turf accountant.
Jolly good.
You guys got the same place
as yesterday?
Of course, my good man,
and be quick about it.
Trapper, you're 47. Hawkeye, 62.
- Good show. Carry on.
- Hip, hip.
- Right-o.
- Cheerio.
You guys got a cold?
- Take cover!
- Air raid!
What air raid?
It's Five o'clock Charlie.
He's the enemy trying to destroy us
from the sky!
Oh, come on, Frank.
He's been trying for six weeks.
- He hasn't hit anything yet.
- He washed out of kamikaze school.
He's a loner, Frank, a misfit.
He's an airborne menace,
and he's going to bomb us!
Well, he has a lovely day for it,
hasn't he, Reggie?
- Oh, hear, hear.
- Where, where?
Frank, give them a direct order.
Oh, do, Frank.
We've never ignored one of those.
I'm a major!
You're only captains.
- That's just an accident of birth.
- Yes, we were born majors.
Someone switched us in our cribs.
- Very funny.
- True. We're twins. Identical majors.
- Shall we?
- Rather.
How can you clown this way?
Don't you realize the danger you're in?
- Frank, you realize for us.
- And you protect us, Uncle Frank.
ByJove, I believe I hear Charlie.
- Who put water in my gun?
- How do you know it's water?
- This isn't even... Where is my gun?
- We sold it.
- We beat it into plowshares.
- It's not funny, hiding my weapon!
I say, shall we toddle off?
Oh, yes. No one's seated
after the first act.
- Metzenbaum scissors.
- Metz.
- I can't see anything. Retractor.
-
The big one.
Boy, this kid's got more junk in him
than a used car lot.
Here he comes, that old bugger.
Right on time.
- What's your number, Ginger?
- Thirty-two and a half yards.
Forget it, honey.
You haven't got a chance.
Three-oh-chromic, G.I.
- What number have you got?
- You got two instruments here.
Just one at a time.
That's a girl.
Well, I'm not saying.
I'm not saying.
Two of mine were stolen last week.
- Gimme some more retraction.
- My little arms are breaking already.
Thirty-two and a half yards.
You're out of your
pretty little mind, honey.
All right, Doctor,
let's clean this place up. That's a boy.
How can you sit there
and just let yourself get bombed?
- One good bombing deserves another.
- Down in front, Frank.
- Honestly, you can't take him anywhere.
- ##
And now, direct from North Korea,
here he is...
...
- Ah, there he is... Charles.
- Oh, yes.
- Hello, Charles!
- I say, he's got a cough today.
- It's a wonder he can fly at all.
- Oh, yes.
- He looks rather peaked to me.
- Fragile.
Well done, Charles!
Jolly good. Jolly good.
- But he missed.
- Ah, yes.
Bad luck, Charles.
See you tomorrow.
Say, shall we repair to the digs
and wait for the results?
Good idea.
We're nearly out of plasma.
Nurse, you're out of uniform.
- Where?
- How about my place in five minutes?
- Colonel!
- Frank, Charlie is like one of our own.
I mean, how else would
we know it's 5:00...
if he didn't come over
and try to blast that ammo dump?
Why can't anyone take this seriously?
It's cute, huh?
I got this little outfit
in the Tokyo P.X. Last week.
Colonel, I must insist...
I didn't know they
were naked underneath.
You're not supposed
to look under there.
Colonel, I insist you
do something about these raids!
Aw, gimme a break, Frank.
Get off my back.
Well, history certainly repeats itself.
Nobody listened to
Billy Mitchell either.
Who's Billy Mitchell?
A general who advocated
a strong air force.
- Gary Cooper played him.
- I thought he played Sergeant York.
He did, but he also played
Billy Mitchell and Lou Gehrig.
And he was for a strong air force.
Hey, that's pretty surprising
for a first baseman.
I am certain that General Clayton
would send us an antiaircraft gun.
And I am sure that General Clayton
is not in the rent-a-gun service.
And anyway, who'd shoot the thing?
Well, I've had some
gunnery experience.
I was in the R.O.T.C.
You'd think a man with R.O.T.C. Training
wouldn't go peeking up a doll's skirt.
- Well, I am a doctor.
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyway, what about calling the general?
- I can't call the general, Frank.
General Clayton's not in his
office, sir. They'll call back.
- I didn't want to talk to him anyway.
- Well, he's not there.
This is yours, sir.
You came closest with 75-1/2 yards.
- There's almost a hundred bucks there!
- Zowie! Holy moley!
CorporalJohnson
came next with 22-3/4.
- Oh, yeah?
- This is insane!
Nobody bet on the Battle of Britain.
"He who controls the skies
controls the war."
Hermann Goering said that.
Yeah, well, he also wore tutus
and ate whole bakeries, Frank.
- I'll file these forms.
- Yeah, file those forms. Whoops!
Hi, Henry.
Just heard the great news.
Hey, congratulations, Henry.
You got a contract out on Henry, Frank?
We're having a poker game in
the Swamp tonight. Saved you a seat.
- If you can't make it, just send money.
- This calls for a celebration.
- General Clayton, sir.
- Oh, thanks, Radar. Henry Blake here.
Get me General Clayton
right away, please.
Oh, this is General Clayton.
Well, Henry Blake here.
H-How are you, General?
Oh, just fine.
No, no, sir, no.
I'm afraid you were a little short.
Well, no, I think you had,
uh, uh... Radar?
- Fifty-two yards, Colonel.
- Fifty-two yards, Colonel.
Right. Uh, oh, sir, excuse me.
While I've got you on the pipe,
the suggestion's been made...
that we could use
an oh-four W.W. "nug."
...
What's a nug, sir?
Well, a nug is a, uh...
A gun, sir. A 40 "M.M." gun.
- Henry, you gotta be kidding!
- We definitely do not need a nug.
- Keep your snoots out of this!
- We don't need a gun or a nug.
What are you trying to do,
get us into the war?
General, listen, you send a gun up here
and that's gonna draw fire.
- That won't do our wounded much good.
- Give me that!
Get rid of the ammo dump
and we won't need a gun!
Do you mind?
The previous suggestion
is contraindicated.
We need an antiaircraft gun
desperately, General!
Frank, how would you like
a spontaneous nose job?
Henry Blake again, General.
What's that, sir?
Uh-huh, yeah, sure.
Check on that.
Put him down for 64 yards
for tomorrow.
Hawkeye and Trapper have 64 yards.
- Well, give it to him.
- What difference does it make?
What's that, sir? Oh, yes, yes, sir,
that's a good idea, as always.
Well, yes, sir.
Thank you. Nice...
Bye. Well, he's coming up tomorrow
to look over the situation.
You better tell Hot Lips
to warm up a merry widow.
Oh, now, that's filthy!
Henry, it's insane to arm this place.
Will you just keep your pants on
till Clayton gets here? He'll decide.
Honestly, you all make me sick!
I think he means
we're contraindicated.
Someday all of this will come out:
Your behavior, your filthy language,
your betting on the enemy.
And believe me, it'll be
a shameful page for Uncle Sam.
Oh, Frank, look,
the general's comin' up here.
- Isn't that good enough for ya?
- Yeah, what more do you want?
I want everybody to understand
that this is war...
and that war is a call to arms.
Here's our money, mister.
Don't staple us.
Someday all this will come out.
- Terribly sorry, Padre.
- Oh, that's all right, General.
I'll just turn the other cheek.
Get yourself something to eat, Sergeant.
Psst!
Margaret! Quickly, before
word gets out that I'm here.
Uh, y-you know Major Burns?
Major Frank Burns?
Yes, of course. Burns.
We wanted to talk to you
before anybody else about the gun.
- There's a war on, General.
- I read the papers.
The major and l...
we two majors...
feel that the colonel
and a certain two captains...
That's two majors against
a colonel and two captains.
What the major is trying to say,
General, is that we feel they will...
- The colonel and two captains.
- Try to influence you against the gun.
Nothing can make a general's mind up
for him. I'll decide this matter myself.
- Now's your chance, General.
- I'd better tell Blake I'm in camp.
- Major, I'll want to discuss this later.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Privately!
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry, sir. Sorry.
Oh, it's classic, Henry.
The ammo dump, the road.
Store material near hospitals
so the enemy will leave it alone.
Hmm? Learned it from the Germans.
Great. Now we're taking lessons
from the losers.
Instead of trying to knock out Charlie,
just get rid of this.
That'll keep him away.
Or does that make too much sense?
Well, I really don't think
a gun is necessary.
-
- Certainly not.
Unless you think I should think
otherwise. No, I don't think that.
And we have a new winner
in the "definite maybe" sweepstakes.
Uh, sir, I think we might be safer
behind that rock back there.
Good thinking, Henry.
Way to go, Charlie!
I knew I should have bet
on the jeep today.
- Henry?
- Yes, sir?
You've got your gun.
To the right flank, "harch"!
To the rear, harch!
Detail, halt, two, three.
Men, I don't have to tell you
of the importance of our mission.
We are the first surgical unit
to have an antiaircraft capability.
Our success is vital.
I repeat, vital.
The eyes of the military are upon us.
Now, first off, um,
any of you speak, uh, English?
Yes, sir, also French,
Italian and a little German.
Then you will be platoon leader.
- I thought that you were platoon leader.
- Oh, well, I am.
But for purposes of our table
of organization, I am the commander.
So you will be platoon leader,
you will be squad leader,
and you... will be the squad.
The enemy very foolishly attacks
at the same time every day.
There's no element of surprise.
The man does not possess
an ounce of cleverness,
which shows you the limitation
of Oriental thinking.
No offense.
Hep, hup, hip, four.
Hep, hup, hip, four.
Hep, hup, hip, four.
Hep, hup, hip, four.
To the rear, march! To the left flank,
march! To the rear, march! Halt!
Right and left face!
Cut that out, face!
Count off!
- Are you one?
- Yes, are you?
That's not funny.
Count off!
- One. That's about it.
- Two.
Okay. At ease.
That strikes me funny, not.
I think it ill behooves us...
Behooves? What are we,
in the cavalry now?
I think it ill behooves us to show such
a frivolous and flippant attitude...
in front of our Korean allies.
Come on, Frank, don't you understand?
Fire draws fire.
You shoot that thing and the next day
we'll have real planes,
MIGs down here throwing bombs
at our wounded.
Maybe you haven't noticed in the
operating room, but we do have wounded.
The combination of malpractice and
flop sweat makes it hard for him to see.
I know what my duty is,
and I intend to do it!
- Fall in!
-
About face!
Forward march!
Hep, hup, hep, four.
Hep, hup, hep, four.
Hep, hup, hep, four.
Flush 'em outta the sky!
How we gonna stop Frank?
On one of his nocturnal visits
to Hot Lips, we sew him to the tent.
He'd probably love it too.
I know I would.
What about this?
A skin graft over his mouth
so he can't give the command to fire.
- He's trigger-happy.
- He can taste that plane.
I wish it would fly down his throat.
- It's not an uncommon phenomenon.
- Hmm?
For medical men and professional guys
to get gung ho.
- A real rabbi?
- Oh, yeah.
- A paratrooper?
- In every way.
Except he won't jump on Saturdays.
Fascinating, but it doesn't help.
Cardozo, booze?
When I left the States,
I promised my wife...
that I wouldn't have a drink
or another woman till I got back to her.
- That's nice.
- Gimme a blast.
Make it a short one.
I got a date tonight.
You know, I been listening.
You guys want another opinion?
You're only a dentist.
Yeah. To you, life is something wet
that hardens overnight,
then you put gold on it.
What you wanna do
is forget about Frank.
I mean, his kind is indestructible.
They always have been.
- That's your opinion?
- Yeah.
Play, Phil. Sing, dentist.
What you want to do
is get rid of the dump.
You take away the dump,
you take away the gun.
You take away the gun,
you take away Frank's motivation...
and the menace is gone.
Just for that idea, we're gonna
put you in the Christmas play.
Yeah, you can be the talking cavity.
But l-I can't give you
four dozen sheets.
Oh, come on, Klein,
you never turned us down before.
Yeah, but four dozen sheets?
- We just met four dozen great girls.
- Four dozen!
A requisition for 18 gallons
of Mercurochrome?
Yeah. We got a patient
with an enormous cut.
I never had a martini that way.
May I?
Oh, please.
Goes great with a soap chaser.
Mmm!
I gotta hand it to us, Trap.
We have made that ammo dump
absolutely unmissable.
- Even for Charlie.
- Two hours to show time. It'll be over.
And poor Frank won't be able
to play with his "ack-ack" anymore.
Hey, let's do something nice for him.
All right. How about a couple
of C.C.'s of the plague?
- We could name an infection after him.
- Or make him the infection.
Either way, it's a nice gesture.
- I just had a terrible idea.
- Hmm?
Hey! This is the nurses' shower!
I waited as long as I could.
She's late today.
Okay, watch it!
Here he comes. Hurry!
Hi, Frank. Down this way.
- We think it's an early abscess.
- Well, why call on me?
Because when it comes to pus,
we always think of you.
This is your arena.
Post-op infections, that's you.
Problem is he should've
had antibiotics immediately.
Fantastic. He goes right to
the heart of the clinical picture.
He's got eyes
in the back of his stethoscope.
Doctor, I'm getting ready to do the
You do that, Ginger.
Give him the 4:30 feeding.
Kind of fun working like this,
huh, guys?
- We got to pull together more, Frank.
- Yeah.
Amen to that, old buddy.
That's Charlie.
Why, it can't be, Frank.
It's only 4:30.
I know Charlie when I hear him.
Impossible.
You... You sneaks!
I've got to get to that gun.
It's Pearl Harbor all over again!
-
- Take your positions, men!
Uh, uh, uh...
Uh, uh, uh...
-
- 180 degrees.
- By 270 point west.
- 270.
-
- Sixty!
- A 60 degree azimuth. Do I hear 65?
-
-
-
- I'm sorry, sir, we already have a 65.
- 65.
- I said 65!
- Let's start all over.
- Colonel!
- I have a colonel. Do I hear a general?
-
- One!
- A one-star general. Do I hear two?
- Two!
Come on, we're not gonna let this
fine war go for just a two-star general.
Henry, what they're doing is mutiny!
- That's a little strong, Frank.
- I'm placing you both under arrest!
I'm losing him.
Fire, damn it! Fire!
- But, sir...
- You heard him, soldier. Fire!
Hell of a shot, Frank.
- Did you see this stuff on vein grafts?
- Yeah, that's fantastic.
I bet that cuts down
on amputations by 50 percent.
Or better.
- You know, I could eat.
- Yeah.
Hey, it's ten after 5:00.
- I miss him.
- Me too.
Hey, tell the truth, Frank.
Don't you miss Charlie?
- Oh, I forgot. You did.
- Oh, Hawk, that's in bad taste.
- If I did, it was all your fault!
- Frank, why don't you join us?
You don't mind eating with
a couple of"peacemongers," do you?
- No.
- Come on, Frank.
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, we're your two buddies.
Come on, Frank.
Why can't I stay mad at you two lugs?
We'll work something out.
