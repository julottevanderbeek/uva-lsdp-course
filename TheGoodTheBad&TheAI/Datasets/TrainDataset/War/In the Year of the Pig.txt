I would remind you
that Scripture tells us...
that blessed are the peacemakers.
I want to underscore
the word "makers."
And it takes a lot of doing...
to make peace.
It takes a good deal of hard work...
building like a mighty cathedral...
stone by stone, block by block.
And I sometimes wonder...
why we Americans enjoy...
punishing ourselves so much...
with our own criticism.
This is a pretty good land.
I'm not saying
you never had it so good.
But that is a fact, isn't it?
I think the most significant aspect...
—
—
but I can show it to you."
Put his thumb on the table...
and said...
"If everywhere
where you put your thumb...
"on the sacred earth of Vietnam...
"there is a plant growing,
then we will succeed.
If not, not."
Now, this is, again,
one of the points where Ho...
on one hand, is a Marxist economist...
who knows the importance
of the basic production...
and, on the other hand,
a Confucian scholar...
because what you have to have in mind
to understand that idea...
of the thumb on the earth...
is a simple Chinese proverb.
"A thumb square...
"of planting rice...
"is more precious...
than a thumb square of gold."
We are now in a very interesting
place about Ho Chi Minh...
because, in this place...
le Paria...
the life of Ho Chi Minh changed,
in my opinion.
Where Ho Chi Minh,
who came in 1917 in Paris...
as a peasant, an Asian peasant...
became really revolutionary...
and an internationalist.
Went on over to the White
House, and it came back...
with the very tight, round
hand of Franklin Roosevelt.
"I want no French returned
to Indochina.
F.D.R."
And I remember
the excitement I felt...
that this was probably the first...
clear U.S. Policy...
towards a Southeast Asian state.
The thing that I think
we failed to recognize...
is that Ho Chi Minh...
communist or whatnot...
is considered
by the people of Vietnam —
and I'm speaking now of millions
in South Vietnam —
as the George Washington
of his country.
—
—
General Gracey was
the principal British officer...
responsible for accepting
the surrender of theJapanese...
in French Indochina
south of the 16th parallel.
And that was his mission.
But after he arrived in Saigon...
—
I met Ho Chi Minh for the first time...
in Hanoi at the end of'45.
—
—
where Ho Chi Minh has been
just a little surprised.
I answered, "I don't know."
He said, "But what are you doing here?"
I said, "I came to ask you
because we have to build it together."
Towards the end
of November
of 1946...
when the admiral
commanding
the French fleet...
in the Bay ofTonkin...
in his words, decided to teach
the Vietnamese government a hard lesson...
the fleet stood off of Haiphong
and shelled the city...
until between 6,000 and 10,000
were killed.
He said, "I have no army."
That's not true now.
"I have no army." 1945.
"I have no finance.
"I have no diplomacy.
"I have no public instruction.
"I have just hatred...
"and I will not disarm it...
until you give me confidence in you."
Now, this is the thing
on which I would insist...
because it's still alive in his memory,
as in mine.
For every time Ho Chi Minh
has trusted us...
we betrayed him.
Here you had a country...
which was not just divided...
at the 17 th parallel.
You had fought the Indochina war...
—
—
We have seen no reason
for the abandonment...
of the so-called Navarre Plan.
—
—
The French miscalculated —
as, I think, did we —
The Battle of Dien Bien Phu...
is a significant phenomenon
in military history...
Forces of aggression seem to be
concentrating just at one point...
at Dien Bien Phu...
—
—
—
—
Senator Morton, sound one, take one.
There was a meeting —
I've forgotten the exact date.
This can be easily ascertained.
I assume that the records
have been kept.
The burden of it was...
Admiral Radford's feeling...
that we should really move in...
and bring active support
to the French.
Specifically, air support
from carrier base —
from carriers.
Carriers were available
in the nearby area.
How many missions could have been mounted?
I don't know.
I didn't get into the military details.
And it was felt that the artillery...
that they had on the high ground...
could be destroyed by air attack.
They fail always because they were
always seen by the Vietnamese...
as a foreign power...
trying to get back
its colonial power.
That is why they lost the war
at Dien Bien Phu.
Dien Bien Phu has fallen.
I join with you in paying tribute...
—
—
—
##
I think the American people this fall...
when they elect a congress —
all of the congressmen,
one-third of the senate —
regardless of whether they're
gonna vote Democrat or Republican...
should ask those senators
and congressmen...
"Mister, if we send you to Washington...
"are you going to continue...
"sending American money...
"to nations which, in turn...
"shift the sinews of economic
and military strength...
to Red China,
which is running the war in Indochina?"
Keeping in mind that if we lose
Indochina, Mr. Jenkins...
we will lose the Pacific...
and we'll be an island
in a communist sea?
Situation in the area
as we found it...
was that it was subject
to the so-called domino theory.
That meant that if one nation went,
then another nation would go, and so on.
We're trying to change that
so it won't be the case.
That's the whole theory
of collective security.
the independence and the freedom...
of Vietnam.
Now, we can renege, if we like...
but what will happen
to our credibility in the world...
if we take that course?
Every day someone jumps up
and shouts and says...
"Tell us what is happening in Vietnam
and why are we in Vietnam...
and how did you get us into Vietnam?"
Well, I didn't get you into Vietnam.
You've been in Vietnam 10 years.
Diem, I said before, was the man of the hour. Why?
of colonialism.
Now, Diem was precisely that man.
—
You have exemplified,
in your corner of the world...
patriotism of the highest order.
You have brought to your great task
of organizing your country...
the greatest of courage,
the greatest of statesmanship —
qualities that have aroused
our admiration...
and make us, indeed,
glad to welcome you.
I thank you very much.
It is understand the plan...
that the interest of the Vietnam...
are identical with the interest...
of the people of the free world.
It is on this plan —
It is on this plan...
that your and our fight...
is one and the same.
We do —
We'll continue to fight communism.
It is not— It may be repeated here —
There is no two Vietnams.
There is only one Vietnam...
temporarily divided
in Geneva in '54...
between a free zone,
which is North Vietnam...
and an occupied zone,
occupied by the French —
but the French had still, after Geneva,
the jurisdiction over South Vietnam...
because they could not hand it over
to a regime which did not exist.
It is not even mentioned
in the Geneva agreement.
The regime of Saigon
is only a temporary one...
in waiting for election.
The refusal was amply justified...
if only because the kind of election...
envisaged by the Geneva agreement
of 1954 —
a free election —
could not have been held.
Anyone who thinks
that a free election...
was possible
in communist North Vietnam...
knows little
of how communists operate...
and could have fallen into
a Moscow-Peiping trap.
The United States could not agree today...
any more than in 1956...
to legitimizing communist control...
of all Vietnam by a device
of a communist-style election.
You all have sat with me...
on the Foreign Relations Committee in 1956...
when our intelligence forces
brought in their reports warning...
that if the election called for
by the Geneva accords...
forJuly 1956 were held...
Ho Chi Minh would be elected
president in South Vietnam...
by at least 80% of the vote.
And our country that boasts about
believing in self-determination...
used its power and its prestige
and its influence...
really to get our first
puppet government under Diem...
not to cooperate
in holding those elections.
That's just a matter
of historic record.
As you know,
when Ngo Dinh Diem and Nhu...
were finally killed in 1963...
some 50,000 to 60,000 —
the precise number
is not readily available —
but some 50,000 to 60,000
political prisoners...
were released from prisons
in South Vietnam subsequent to this.
Uh, elements
of the rotating governments...
And from 1958...
we see the existence,
confirmed by some American experts...
and some broadcasts from —
of a National Front for Liberation
of South Vietnam.
Uh, the Front is not what you
would call a puppet of Hanoi.
The two
organizations —
and I do stress
they are two
organizations —
work very closely together.
Many of their aims are parallel aims...
but their ideas do not always coincide...
and, indeed, sometimes their policies
are in conflict.
is best described...
by the increase of corruption...
by the increase of the influence...
of a near psychopath
like his brother Nhu...
and his wife, Madame Nhu...
both of whom had a drive for power...
which I can only describe
as pathological.
I had, once, dinner with them...
and Nhu told me, "You see...
"we could have an opposition in Vietnam...
"if I led it...
"but since I'm the only
intelligent man in South Vietnam...
"all my mental capacity...
—
Staley bought this strategic hamlet
from Nhu.
Nhu brought it out as a new little goodie —
no pun intended —
but came up
with the strategic hamlet...
and this amounted to the same old approach
of forced relocation...
the living behind bars...
the total regimentation of the social
and the fabric of the society.
One of the more significant things
about the strategic hamlet...
is that they were physically
and literally demolished by the Vietcong...
after Diem and Nhu were killed.
Every stick was taken down
and every piece of wire.
The enemy took this off
to make use of it...
and told the people,
"Return to your ancestral homes."
And at that time they began to take
effective control over the countryside.
—
In this affair, I do not think
that we should worry too much...
because we have the same faith.
Whatever happens in my country,
we shall not feel it alone.
You, also —You will feel it.
The base of Diem was his army,
which was American-supported...
and American aid coming through...
and the police force...
and, generally, an increasingly
police-state technique.
But there was no dissent. They controlled
the legislature, which was a rubber stamp.
About the question
of a horrible stamp...
I have repeatedly said...
"But what's wrong to have a stamp
the laws we approve?"
A major policy paper issued
by the State Department...
in December of 1961...
stated flatly— and I quote...
"The years 1956 to 1960...
"produced something close
to an economic miracle...
"in South Vietnam.
"It is a report of progress
over a few brief years...
equaled by few young countries."
It has been said by Confucius,
wonderfully well —
He said, "Never have laws too precise...
"because the precision of the law
gives a possibility to get around it.
"Have laws
that are built by governments...
"which are reliable,
which know you...
which are close to you."
And this is how, in the organization
of the Vietnamese society...
the village was so essential.
And I think that this has been
the great mistake of Ngo Dinh Diem —
to replace the leader of the village...
who was the expression
of the country...
the expression, as they say...
of the wind and the water...
of the locality.
He replaced that
by appointed village chiefs.
Now, when the Vietcong
assassinated village chiefs...
they were not at all village chiefs...
but people who were not
belonging there...
and it was a scandal to a village
to have them there.
And so when the Vietcong assassinated
so many of those people —
and I am not a man
who likes to hear...
that people have been assassinated —
And some of them might have been
very good people.
The majority might have
been acceptable...
if they had been
the expression of the village.
But at the very point
where the Vietnamese nation...
the Vietnamese earth...
arises and speaks
to the government...
through the — not chiefs —
through the representatives
of the village...
the elders of the village...
at that very point
where the life of the country is...
Ngo Dinh Diem put, simply...
a wet blanket of functionaries.
Just at the point where was...
the life of the country...
he brought the extinguishing methods...
of a government which was not
a government for the Vietnamese.
There are members from both parties
here today to greet him.
There were members of both parties
in his group...
going around the world.
This was an American effort
to indicate our great concern...
for the cause of freedom
in insignificant and important countries...
around the world.
We visited in several countries...
When Vice-PresidentJohnson...
which was also part
of the '61 arrangement —
When he came to Vietnam,
he announced...
a series of things
that the United States was going to do.
And this is when we made
a fundamental change in our policy.
I can remember Bernard Fall in 1962...
Bernard Fall interrupted and said,
"That sounds like a vicious circle."
Pham Van Dong paused and said,
"No, not a vicious circle.
A downward spiral."
I'm Roger Hillsman.
I was Director of Intelligence and Research
in the State Department...
underJohn F. Kennedy...
and then Assistant Secretary of State
for Far Eastern Affairs...
under Kennedy and, for a while,
under PresidentJohnson.
And then there stepped forward
a very frail old man in his 70s...
who turned out to be
this priest Quang Duc.
And he assumed the lotus posture.
more than to point out that
when this monk burned himself...
Ngo Dinh Diem really believed that American
television networks had staged this.
They had paid the Buddhists
to stage this burning for their own benefit.
I mean, after all,
the Americans were Diem's allies.
And then suddenly, a towering flame.
It had enormous
political consequences...
outside of Vietnam
and inside of Vietnam.
Uh, people thought they saw...
the face of Buddha
in the clouds that night.
People have spoken very much about...
the monks who burned themselves.
But those monks
who burned themselves...
burned themselves because
they were incited to do it.
—
—
I think the idea of that was, well,
that he had become an expendable man.
American policy had always been
that he was the only man we had.
Johnson had called him
the Winston Churchill of Southeast Asia...
which is a unique tribute
to Mr. Churchill.
So I think with this, they had changed
the American policy view —
that they were expendable.
We just support
the anticommunist effort."
It wasn't that they were on the side
of the others, but they made it very clear...
that they would stand aside.
And with that, they spelled
the final end to that regime.
We've gone in on the assumption —
this is the myth —
that a friendly government
has asked us to come in...
and prevent a takeover.
In other words, you cannot defeat
the communists...
without the support of the people.
And to have this support...
you must bring justice
to the people.
In other words...
equality and freedom.
Justice. Justice.
Banish corruption.
Give to the people...
a higher standard of living...
and make them feel free.
There were two things that he
very, very much wished to avoid.
One was making this an American war.
As he used to say,
"It's their war— the South Vietnamese.
"We can give them aid.
We can even give them advisers.
But they must win it or lose it."
And I think he was fully prepared
to let them lose it...
rather than make it an American war.
He felt that if we put Americans
in there, with their white faces...
it would drive nationalism
into the arms of communism.
The second thing he wished to avoid was
internationalizing the war, as we called it.
By this we meant bombing the north
or attacking the north.
First and foremost
because it would not work.
And here 30-some odd months of bombing
has shown that his judgment was right.
I think that, uh, there's
great danger in this country, uh...
because of the fact that
so much of our economy...
is geared, uh, in the military area.
There is grave danger of, uh...
a military-industrial alliance
of a kind...
uh...
actually affecting policy.
Now, uh, Vietnam is a case in point.
Uh, not the only place, because
we're spending $50 billion a year...
of Vietnam...
for our military.
And, uh, I do think that, uh...
having dropped more bombs on Vietnam...
than were dropped by all the Allied powers
in World War II, in tonnage...
on that small country—
I mean, to me,
it's just, how silly can you get?
Present...
arms!
I think communist aggression
must result in communist disaster.
And I don't think you're gonna
get that at the conference table.
The world is watching us in Vietnam...
to see if we'll put our money
where our mouth is.
- It's just that simple.
And I just wish that, uh, uh...
we would decide to win the war...
and that we would step out
and close the port of Haiphong...
and hit every military,
renumerative target over there.
I think you're, uh, a better chance to bring
the communists to the conference table...
than if we do not hurt them.
However, American instinct makes us
want to jump in with both feet...
and get an unpleasant job over with
as soon as possible.
But traditional Oriental patience...
makes them willing
to carry on the struggle...
into generation after generation,
if necessary.
We're fighting a war over there...
with a commodity...
most precious to us...
and held far more cheaply
by the enemy—
the lives of men.
I don't think it's necessary to have
an invasion of North Vietnam.
It would be just exactly
what the enemy wants.
He'd like us to put down 100,000 men
in the field, and they'd put down 100,000.
They're willing to lose half of theirs,
and ours is a precious commodity.
I wouldn't trade one dead American
for 50 dead Chinamen.
We must fight the war from  strength,
not the enemy's.
We must fight it
at least cost to ourselves...
and at greatest cost to the enemy.
We must change the currency of this game
from men to material.
What's that?
What is the greatest single problem
we're facing in Vietnam?
Well, it's the despicable
communist enemy.
No question about it.
And the sooner we smash him,
as we should have done in Korea —
If we'd done it in Korea,
in our first test of arms with communism...
we wouldn't be confronted, I don't think,
with the situation we have in Vietnam.
Do you have respect for the Vietcong?
Do you think they're a good soldier?
Well, there's no question about it.
They're willing to die readily, as all Orientals are.
And their leaders will sacrifice them,
and we won't sacrifice ours.
The only solution I see...
is to use our strength —
our air and naval power—
in the most humane possible m —
manner— manner possible...
to destroy North Vietnamese
capability to wage war...
against the free people
of South Vietnam.
So I think the sooner that we hit
everything we can and hurt 'em over there...
we got a better chance
to win that war...
and that's exactly what we should do,
in my opinion.
So, the harbor at Haiphong...
and the entire capacity
to receive outside help — close it.
The power system that fuels
every war-making facility...
the transportation system —
rails, rolling stock, bridges, yards —
eliminate 'em.
Every factory
and every industrial installation...
beginning with
the biggest and the best...
and never ending, so long as there are
two bricks still stuck together.
And, if necessary, the irrigation system,
on which food production largely depends.
We must be willing
to continue our bombing...
until we've destroyed every work of man
in North Vietnam...
if this is what it takes
to win the war.
Then there was
a little crisis there.
The military thought that
there was a great infiltration.
Secretary McNamara went out, came back
and said, "No, there wasn't a crisis at that time."
But I thought
it was very significant...
that PresidentJohnson
then appointed a committee...
to prepare a list of targets in the north...
in case he should decide
to bomb the north.
The more I thought about this,
the more I became convinced...
that if there were a crisis,
he would escalate the war.
This is part of
the steady escalation...
that's taken place
during the last five years.
First we sent in only advisers.
Then it developed these advisers
were also in combat.
Then we sent in the marines...
and the first thing was said was
they were only there to defend.
The next thing was that
they were to shoot back if attacked.
And now there is an admission
that we're all in.
Some others are eager
to enlarge the conflict.
They call upon us
to supply American boys...
to do the job
that Asian boys should do.
They ask us to take
reckless action...
which might risk
the lives of millions...
and engulf much of Asia...
and certainly threaten the peace
of the entire world.
A second deliberate attack...
was made
during darkness...
by an
undetermined number...
of North Vietnamese P.T. Boats...
on the U.S. S
and the U.S. S
while the two destroyers
were cruising in company...
on routine patrol duty...
in the Tonkin Gulf...
in international waters...
some 65 miles
from the nearest point of land.
They put out that propaganda,
but they got caught...
because we were able to disclose
within two days...
that if they would check upon the log
of the  for example...
they would find she
was only 11 to 13 miles...
from the bombing of those islands.
And, of course, that's coverage.
And the North Vietnamese
knew that it was coverage.
—
Our naval vessels
afford no cover whatsoever.
Now, the sad fact is,
history will record...
that the United States
was an aggressor in Tonkin Bay.
We were violating the rights
of North Vietna —
They had no right to proceed
on the second day...
to, ourselves, bomb...
uh, North Vietnam —
the areas where
her torpedo boats were kept.
But we had a duty—
That wasn't self-defense.
Bombing North Vietnam was not
within the right of the president...
to act in self-defense
of the republic.
My duties on board
the seaplane tender were...
nuclear weapons officer.
On August 4...
there was an alleged attack
upon the U.S. S
TurnerJoy...
Destroyer personnel indicated at first
that they were under attack...
and later indicated uncertainty
as to whether or not they were under attack.
Large numbers of torpedoes...
were supposed to have been fired.
The ship was, uh...
reporting itself as continuously maneuvering
to avoid torpedo attack...
and yet there was also indicated
in these messages...
doubt as to whether or not
they were under attack at all.
And I have a feeling, therefore,
that this harassment attack...
and this attack with 20 or more torpedoes
upon two of our destroyers...
was designed to force us out,
in a way...
lest we precipitate
a greater struggle.
I have a feeling that they've
misread America once again.
In the course of our conversation...
this chief petty officer told me
that he was a sonar man...
on board the U.S. S
and that he had been in sonar—
the sonar room —
during the attack.
He told me that,
in his estimation...
there were no torpedoes
fired at the ship or otherwise...
during that alleged attack...
and furthermore,
he constantly repeated this —
uh, sent this information
to the commanding officer on the bridge.
This is purely precautionary...
so that the fleet will be prepared
for all eventualities.
- Well, possible submarine attack.
By anyone.
—
I am contending that having
the  there...
constituted...
in view of the knowledge as to what
the South Vietnamese boats were up to...
an act of constructive aggression
on our part.
The Vietnamese situation...
as I noted on my visit back home
last week and this week...
has taken on some real spirit
and real interest.
I thought perhaps a statement by
the joint senate-house Republican leadership...
would be timely and quite in order
at this moment.
As a result of what we have done
in South Vietnam...
not only has
the psychology changed there...
but also it has had
a most beneficial effect...
in my opinion...
among other free Asian countries...
who looked at South Vietnam
as a test.
Okay, today—
—
—
Well, search and destroy
is an attempt to...
West of the stream
and east of the road. Roger.
Oh, geez, I don't know.
About...
How far back does it go?
- Come on.
Oh, look at that.
—
—
The prisoners that we've captured are —
that have been captured...
say that this is the most feared weapon
outside the B-52s.
That is because of the amount
of ammunition we carry...
the various types of weapons
in the amount of time we can stay on station.
and ammunition for them.
Occasionally, the crew rat-holes a few things
they don't tell us about until they're airborne.
You look like
you enjoy your work. Why?
Well, I been doin' it for 36 months
since I been in the service.
—
and blew 'em, picked up some weapons,
killed a few V.C.
We're now gonna sweep back through,
go to the railroad and move back to the west.
- What's gonna happen to the people tonight?
They'll huddle real close together.
They'll keep warm.
—
—
—
under this R.V.N. Program...
where they teach them propaganda for
three months — they hold 'em for three months.
That's why they won't admit
they know this man here.
We've put over three million of them
into what I would call a concentration camp.
They call it a refugee center.
It's got barbed wire around it.
They can't get out of it.
We've taken these people
from the graves of their ancestors...
from their rice paddies...
and we say, "Oh, well,
we've pacified X-million people."
Yeah, we've pacified some more people
by putting them in these camps.
I'll wind this up in a hurry.
I know many people have said
we've killed innocent people.
Our bombs have killed civilians
and babies and mothers...
and I suppose
there is truth to that.
There have been people
that have been killed.
But your government
has not bombed civilians.
Your government
has not bombed open cities.
Your government has sent its bombers in
after targets — military targets...
that have been placed in an area
surrounded by civilians.
Try a sweep-around?
—
—
—
or to wean those folks away from
the communists, rather than to destroy them.
They are the subject
of our constant concern...
because
they're such
a magnificent...
group of
fighting men.
Their morale is extremely high.
They always have a smile.
I was at a very
kind of sobering thing last night —
a memorial service for four men
in the 2nd Squadron...
who were killed the other day,
one of them being a medic.
And the place was just packed.
We sang three hymns
and had a nice prayer.
I turned around and looked at their faces...
and they were —
I was just proud.
My feeling for America just soared
because of their—
the way they looked.
They looked determined
and, and reverent at the same time.
But still, they're a bloody good
bunch of killers.
When a captive is taken by...
the United States
or free world forces...
as a standard policy.
We were told by our C. O
after our first battle...
that from then on we weren't
gonna take any prisoners.
My name is John Toller.
I'm a sergeant in the U.S. Army Special Forces,
known as the Green Berets.
I'm en route to Vietnam.
However, I'm deserting the army...
because I'm protesting the U.S. Involvement
in the Vietnamese conflict.
Today your soldiers, sailors,
airmen, marines and coast guardsmen...
are better educated than before...
are better informed...
have traditional American
ingenuity and initiative...
are better physical specimens...
have high morale...
and understand
what the war is all about.
As I mentioned before...
about changing the minds
of the apathetic populace...
the key is the communication...
and most of the American soldiers I know
can't communicate.
They don't really understand
the Vietnamese way of life...
and its goal.
And the only way they can communicate
is through money or with a gun.
So after a while
they develop this kind of fear.
And so, a misunderstanding
and a noncommunication —
They mistrust the Vietnamese...
and they kind of despise them.
Once we got to Vietnam,
it was an entirely different story.
The officers started referring
to the Vietnamese as "gooks."
—
-  American girls!
They're off-limits to me.
They're gooks. You know, slant-eyed.
They're no good.
I'm David Werfel...
professor of political science
at the University of Missouri.
I'm a specialist
in Southeast Asian politics.
I spent about seven years in Asia...
teaching, researching...
Isn't it true, though, that the censorship now
is going to be a little more rigorous...
as soon as the campaign starts?
No, sir, I don't think so.
But you have said, have you not,
that the Vietnamese press...
should not criticize
the candidates in the election?
Why is that, sir?
Well, it's our formal...
and present policy.
I don't think it's wise...
to allow people
to use free press...
to, you know, issue...
critici — criticism of each other...
because it created more confusion,
more division among the people.
We should call
to the attention of the people...
that the folks
that are doing the most...
to keep us from having
a fair and free election...
in Vietnam today...
are the Vietcong...
and the North Vietnamese themselves.
being true to the origin
of the elections in the first place...
was very much concerned...
about how the American people
would interpret these elections...
and he saw that
it was necessary to appoint...
an official observer team.
I saw even in Saigon, uh,
in working-class districts...
where on election day,
rather early in the afternoon...
the polling place ran out of vote —
uh, ran out of, uh, ballots.
And there were people
already lined up...
wanting to vote
at this polling place.
When it was announced
that they had run out of ballots...
the poor washer women
and workmen were frightened to death —
"We've got to vote! We've got to vote!
We've got to have our clipped voting card!"
hailed by the United States —
Johnson administration...
as being a popular
and legitimate government...
nearly two-thirds of the people
voting against it...
and even that 35%, of course,
being to a considerable extent...
a result of fraud
and, uh, intimidation.
##
What I think we've come to,
and what I think the tragedy of Vietnam...
clearly
demonstrates...
is that we now
find ourselves...
in a world in which
the arrangements of power...
cannot yet be ignored...
but in which
the instruments of power...
no longer work.
If this lesson has been taught us
in Vietnam...
then the stubborn little guerrillas
out there...
who sawed off the American giant
at the knees and brought him down...
almost like David versus Goliath...
will have done a great service
not only to their own cause...
whatever one may think about it...
but perhaps to the cause
of world peace...
and perhaps most particularly
to the colossus himself.
Maybe we needed
to be brought up short.
Maybe what we've been doing
in Vietnam all along...
is an exercise in what
Senator Fulbright has called...
the arrogance of power.
We cannot retreat...
from anyplace...
and I can tell you
that we don't intend to retreat.
We were asked
by the State Department...
to prepare a letter
and send it to Ho Chi Minh...
through a channel which had been opened
and was available to us.
We were certain would deliver
the letter directly to him.
It was a very conciliatory letter
written in the State Department...
in consultation, word by word,
with Secretary Bundy...
Secretary Katzenbach and others...
in which we spoke on behalf—
this was the actual phraseology—
"on behalf of" high officials
of the State Department.
All of Asia — free Asia —
as well as communist Asia...
is watching Vietnam.
And if, for example,
out of this present struggle...
after making this great commitment...
after turning around
the psychology in Asia...
we then agree to a coalition government
with the communists...
or we force the South Vietnamese
into a neutralized position...
and neutralize as we did Laos...
or if we make...
any kind of territorial concessions
to the Vietcong...
either one of these three
courses of action...
would be interpreted as a retreat...
and also a defeat, not only for South Vietnam
but for the United States.
We had an extended interview —
almost two hours —with Ho Chi Minh.
It was perfectly clear,
in the course of that interview...
that Ho Chi Minh was delivering to us
certain information he expected us to deliver...
back to the State Department.
And on the side of Ho Chi Minh...
understand that, first of all,
he will bring to the negotiation...
the prestige of an unparalleled life
of devotion to his country.
In the history of this century...
he will be  great patriot.
And be careful here.
Don't forget that he is a Marxist.
And don't expect him to turn a traitor
to the ideal of his life.
He was unyielding on the point
that the bombing had to halt...
before his negotiators would enter into
any kind of substantive discussions.
But I think he was trying to make the point,
and making it repeatedly...
that after that the agenda was open.
There may be those who say, well,
obviously you haven't offered them enough.
Well, it's true that we haven't
offered them South Vietnam.
And it is true that we have not
agreed to assure them...
that we will stop the bombing
on a permanent and unconditional basis.
We discovered sometime later...
when the correspondence
was made public by Hanoi...
that four days
before our letter could arrive in Hanoi...
a letter arrived there,
sent over PresidentJohnson's signature...
which was
a very hard line letter indeed...
which restated all the previous conditions
regarding cessation of the bombing...
and even added some new ones...
and which was, in our judgment...
intended to do what it did do...
which was to break off any possibility
of negotiation at that time.
This letter,
we subsequently learned...
had been written
two days before ours was written...
in conjunction with
the State Department.
We found, to our surprise
and shock, I might say...
that Harriman was already saying that
he proposed to negotiate the settlement...
by suggesting that there had to be
some reciprocal military action...
in return for the final
cessation of the bombing.
In other words, the same point
thatJohnson had been standing on...
he made the speech
of March 31.
It was almost as though Harriman
turned off his hearing aid...
when we told him this would not work...
this was not the understanding
the North Vietnamese had...
and they would certainly repudiate it...
if he attempted to take that position
at the bargaining table.
And this, of course,
is what did happen at Paris.
In the view of the North Vietnamese...
the reciprocity means...
United States
is bombing North Vietnam...
and North Vietnam
must bomb United States.
This, in their view, is reciprocity.
Since North Vietnam
is  bombing the United States...
the United States
should not bomb North Vietnam.
The general impression
that I came away with —
and I think here I would speak
for my colleague Bill Baggs —
was that we were dealing
with the State Department...
on a basis of what we have
come to call Fulbright's Law —
"Never Trust the State Department."
Bombing is going on in the south.
We haven't bombed
anybody's embassy in Hanoi...
but they've bombed
our embassy in Saigon.
Arms continue to flow.
Men continue to come.
We've tried all over the Earth
to find an answer to the question...
what else would stop
if the bombing stopped?
The niceties of the argument about
whether there are two Vietnams...
or one Vietnam...
seem quite inconsequential
when you're talking to Ho Chi Minh.
It would seem incredible...
that this man does not speak
for most of the Vietnamese —
not all, but most —
and the idea that there could be
some arbitrary geographic dividing line...
that would cut off his influence...
has been proved an absurdity...
by the figure and determination...
of the National Liberation Front...
that fights in his name in the south.
My name is Ilya Todd.
I'm a journalist on the non-communist,
liberal, left-wing French paper...
Le nouvel observateur.
I first went to South Vietnam
when escalations started in 1965...
and I first went to North Vietnam
at the end of 1967.
Uh, I'm Harrison Salisbury
of the
Uh, assistant managing editor
of the
I'm, uh, Father Daniel Berrigan.
I'm working here at Cornell teaching...
and helping with the peace movement.
It's about one month
since I was in North Vietnam...
on a project to get
the three American flyers out.
At the time I went to North Vietnam...
the communiques which were being issued,
by Washington in particular...
that was just sort of
vaguely fighting back.
But after seeing many battles
against American planes...
—
—
It's unusual to see so many people
with guns in their hands...
and it's most unusual to see this
in a communist country.
The government has understood this...
and I think this is one of the reasons
why it has armed most of the population.
There is nothing
that has not been attacked —
There is no threat that has not
been tried to be burned...
or frayed or broken by us...
and yet none of it has happened,
or it's been repaired in the night.
Altogether,
I think one can say, objectively...
that there isn't a town left standing,
apart from Haiphong and Hanoi.
So that there are hospitals,
there are schools.
There is a trusted government...
and there are —
there are political leaders...
whom they don't hesitate
to call loved and admired.
Which is to say,
the war's not working.
It's a very simple judgment.
Too simple
for the complexities of our power.
Uh, perhaps, in a deeper spiritual sense,
too tough to face...
because it means the end of a giant.
It means the last days of Superman.
It means that for those...
with the capacity of overkill...
kill is not enough.
Um...
the real thing required
is to live in the real world.
As Buber says, it is to be able to imagine
the real world and imagine human beings.
As long as the dinosaur couldn't do it,
he ended up on the museum shelf...
and as long as Superman can't do it,
he can rave and destroy...
but he cannot give life...
and he cannot even truly,
as we know so bitterly, he cannot live himself.
But seeing the North Vietnamese fighting,
in the country and in the towns...
I think that psychologically it is true.
I was most interested to find
that when I got to Hanoi...
the authorities...
put no restrictions
on what I wanted to send out.
—
—
—
a passion for education...
a passion for grass-roots involvement
in their own future...
their own social structures,
their own politics...
and that at the other end of that power,
which they are trying to move upward...
after so many, many years
of colonial powerlessness...
at the other end of that power is standing
a man who also has a rice bowl in his hand...
and whose poverty is equivalent...
Yet there is one light of hope...
and this is that...
throughout Vietnamese history
they had catastrophes —
—
made
