Let's go!
...facing the violent offensive
by rebel factions
who are now 1 2 miles from the city.
Government forces have deployed
and claim to control the situation.
ln a statement from the President,
he said, and I quote,
"l'm waiting for the imminent
intervention of UN forces."
Fofo!
Come on, let's go.
No men, no war!
- Death dealer!
- No die, no rest!
- You don't wanna die...

Gentlemen, our mission
is to capture the TV station.
Yes, sir!
Before we attack the TV station,
we make sure we're ready,
we get in the spirit, one by one.
- Mad Dog!
- Yes, sir, general.
This coke will jack you up.
War cry!
Who's there?
Who the fuck is there?
You're a fucking Dogo man.
You work for the Dogo president.
Where you going?
Open up!
Fucking stop!
Give me your bag.
No Good Advice, hold the bag.
- You know this woman here?
- No.
Please!
l've seen her somewhere before.
She's the one who gives the news.
She's the newswoman.
She talks about us, says we're rebels,
coming to kill the people.

Chief, l wanna do her too.
Be honest when you talk about us.
No Good Advice, she's all yours.
Spread your legs!

The war has displaced people.
Most families have lost relatives
and loved ones.
I lost six family members:
my mother, my grandmother,
my father...
Suddenly, the rebels show up
and grab your people,
three or four family members,
and kill them in front of you.
You're forced to laugh.
The kids, they say, "Laugh."
And if you cry, you die.
When l sit and think,
I just don't know.
I got nobody around to advise me.
Nobody.
I didn't lay eyes on my mother.
I left for one week
and they killed all of them.
Who are you?
Death dealer.
- Password?
- No die, no rest.
l'm General Dirty Soldier!
l'm No Good Advice.
No men, no war!
- What the what!

The war cry!
Call me Mad Dog.
l'm No Good Advice!
We're fucking soldiers!
l'm Young Major.
We'll fuck up the dogs!
l'm Small Devil,
and l'll rip your heart out!
No need to be fucking around.
No need to be wasting time.
I wanna be a Ranger.
A Ranger was a motherfucker.
A Ranger was a brave soldier.
- Am I right or wrong?
- You right.
- Tell me if l'm wrong.
- You damn fucking right.
Mad Dog!
Yes, general.
Get your men prepared for tomorrow.
Everybody get ready,

We set fire to the city tomorrow.
You're the target commander.
l need the city asap.
- You got it?
- Yes, general.
Go and get prepared.
Gentlemen, we have again
done a great task for this country
by capturing the TV station
that the government used
for propaganda to the outside world.
Without the TV station,
there are no means to communicate
with the people.
ln a few days we'll be in the city.
Once there, we'll chase the Dogos out,
house by house, street by street,
until we get rid of them.
There's a bridge ahead.
When we get on the bridge,
we'll put fire to the city
and get the president out of power.
We need to liberate our people,
bring freedom to our people.
We have to make sure our resources
are used in the right way.
The Dogos have been oppressing
our people forever.
Be very wary of them.
Watch out for the luggage
on their heads.
They can hide weapons
in their mattresses.
l don't want you to die
on the mission.
The mission is crucial.
Your life is tied to the mission.
Be careful with your life!
Am l clear?
Yes, sir!
They can shoot you in the back.
l don't want you to lose your lives
on this mission.
- You get it?
- Yes, sir!
We're going to reach the city
and get the president out of power!
You, you know me?
l'm Johnny Mad Dog,
Small Boy Unit commander.
- Your name!
- Fatumata.
Fatumata, you Dogo girl.
But today you'll join my unit.
- What for?
- Shut up, No Good Advice.
But she's a Dogo.
The girl will help us
kill the fucking Dogo president.
We'll get peace in our country.
Freedom in our country,
you like it?
Follow me. Let's go.
- You ready to fight the war with me?
- Yes, sir!
- Death dealers, you listening?
- Yes, sir!
You are the death dealers, rebels.
We are now about to start our mission.
Gentlemen, l want you to be calm.
This war is our war.
Free your heart.
Fight the war as a soldier.
Relax your mind.
Open your heart to the revolution.
Fight, no retreat.
Don't think about home.
After the revolution
you'll get your benefits.
Money will be given
and you'll go see your parents.
We need to go
and capture the whole fucking city.
You need to go.
No retreat, no surrender...
No ma and pa...
Any soldier talking about ma and pa
will be executed.
Gentlemen, death dealer rebels,
be strong and vigilant.
Guys, you seen it for yourselves,
you're now bullet-proof!
Don't draw back from war,
if they fire at you, fire back.
- You don't wanna die...
- Don't be born!
- Mad Dog!

Your next mission is to move
to the embassy.

Where are you?

My men are on patrol.
The streets are empty,

You got no self respect, old man!
Everybody's waiting for you! Hurry!
Chicken Hair!
Come here! Report!
We're gonna carry the old man's pig
to the truck.
Put it on my neck.
Go, take the coat.
- C.Y.A!

- You all know what?
- No.
At any moment,
if l see a looter around here,
l'll damage his life!
l don't wanna see no looter here.
- You hear?
- Yes, sir!
Deploy.
All men deploy!
l found a weapon.
- Where?
- Over there.
- What weapon is it?
- An Uzi.
- Chinese?
- No, lsraeli.
Chuck Norris used it
in Delta Force.
So be careful!
The lsraelis or Chuck Norris
might be around.
- Butterfly.
- Yes, sir.
Try this arm.
Be careful with it.
Try it! Don't be scared. Try it!
- On the ground!
- Sit the fuck down!
Look at the chief!
The password?
Face the chief!
You don't wanna talk?
What's the password?

You a government trooper?
Take his clothes off
and tie him up.
- Your ma's name?
- Ataouza.
- Your pa's name?
- Abriye.
Look at the mark on this man.
He looks like a government fighter.
He's a government troop man.
Today is his last day.
Show me your finger.
That man's a fucking fighter!
He's denying it!
- Who fired at my pickup?
- Not me.
Tell me the truth. Was it you?
l didn't fire.
Why did you have the Uzi then?
- l didn't.
- So why you hiding?
My oranges.
You were hiding for your oranges?
My ma sent me to look for food.
Tell the truth!
You lie and I'll kill you.
Who fired at my pickup?
Look at me!
Why you fight for the government?
You'll die poor.
Chief, l seen that man before.
He's a fucking government troop man.
He was on reconnaissance.
When we catch these spies
they pretend to cry,
but they are not crying,
they can hit us in the back.
He's an enemy.
You'll die today, my boy.
- l'm not a fighter, I go to school.
- What school?
- What school?
- Methodist.
- Your teacher?
- Teacher Perry.
Stink mouth!
You fucking Dogo man!
Fucking Dogo man!

Motherfucker! Move! Move!
Shit, let's carry the man.
Chicken Hair,

lt's dangerous here.
l saw some smoke up there.
Fast! Let's get him out of here.
Sniper in the building!
Reinforcements 1 ,2,3!
All clear, all clear!
It is my will that when I die
Don't bury me, don't bury me
You cut my dick in alcohol
And call my wife and give it to her
And when she cry, let her cry
When she roll let her rock
And what the fuck she thinks she is
She fucking around with my GI dick
Another man will counsel her
Another man will comfort her
Take my rifle and my bonnet
Call my son and give it to him
Let him defend or let him fight
For his country, for his people
It is my will...
- Death dealer!
- No die, no rest.
Gentlemen, keep moving.
Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck you rebels!
- They all deserve death.
Stand back!

Our general wants us to find
the government troops!
No arms allowed inside!
No one can enter armed.
- l can't leave my weapon.
- You have to.
My weapon is my mother
and my father!
No arm is allowed in here!
Nobody's stopping you from entering.
No arms allowed, it's a hospital.
Who are you to give me orders?
We'll enter today.
Any troops inside?
No, we only have civilians.
They're the only ones who count.
We're the ones fighting the war!
You're just standing around!
You speak English?
We have a wounded soldier,
so we wanna go inside!
You wanna lose your lives?
You know that the president
is already dead.
We control the city now.
We want to go inside and check.
We're freedom fighters!
Take our wounded and we'll go.
Who are you to stop us?

We'll kill you all

- Okay.
Dad,

They got a lot of Dogos inside.
We're not afraid of the Dogo people.
We are brave soldiers.
You afraid of the UN soldiers?
Shut your fucking mouth.

a tactical retreat.
So what do we do now?
We wait for the general's call.
We're all hungry now,

There's plenty of food around here.
We don't have a good knife

Nasty!
Go clean the pig.
Eat the fucking pig.
Clean it and eat it.
Everybody's hungry.
Last time, when it wasn't your pig,
you were the first one to say,
"Let's eat the pig."
Now, when it's your pig,
you keep it for you.
We were on mission
when you took it.
Move on, let's go!
Let's go! You're not going?
Stay but we'll eat the pig,
that's the fucking truth.
Stupid man.
You act like the pig was yours.
Hello, Never Die.

Where are you?
At the hospital.
The UN is giving us a hard time.
We're busy at the Palace.

No food or medication.
We got it! Victory is ours!
We're on the move!
So we win the war?
Hello, Never Die...

You hold a gun before?
Try to fire this one.
Fire it.
Fire it. Try it.
You know how to fire a gun now,
Lovelita.
Do you know what's on my neck?
This is my protection.
The bullets fly past me.
They can't touch me.
lt makes me invisible.
You see what's on my back here?
Bullets can't touch me there.
That's why l'm still alive.
My general, Never Die...
He has some protection.
lf you fire at him,
the bullets turn into water.
lf l make it to colonel,
he'll give me one.
How long you been fighting

Somebody stole my wheelbarrow.

Five dollars.
That's not enough.

Our Lord and our God,
Daddy and l thank You
for sparing my life
to see this day.
Lord, as my father
is dead and gone...
lf it is Your will, Lord,
let Your will be done.
May his soul rest
in perfect peace
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
Five score years ago,
a great American in whose
symbolic shadow we stand today,
signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
This momentous decree came
as a great beacon light of hope
to millions of Negro slaves
who had been seared in the flames
of withering injustice.
It came as a joyous daybreak
to end the long night
of their captivity.
But one hundred years later,
the Negro still is not free.
The life of the Negro
is still sadly crippled
by the manacles of segregation
and the chains of discrimination.
One hundred years later,
the Negro lives
on a lonely island of poverty
in the midst of a vast ocean
of material prosperity.
One hundred years later,
the Negro is still languished
in the corners
of American society...
Who's on the radio?
...and finds himself in exile
in his own land.
He's the president.
Now, we need our own money.
We need our fucking money.
So what do you say about it?
There's no fucking shit!
No more money.
Butterfly! Check behind the house.
You think l'm stupid?
You think l'm joking?
The old American car outside,
you took the batteries?
Take everything. The tires
and the batteries are buried outside.
Take the keys,
take what you want and leave.
Put it all down!
All the US dollars and all!
With all their fancy diamonds,
they're mocking us.
- No Good Advice.
- Yes, sir.
l'll take this one for Lovelita.
- lt's fine?
- Yeah.
lt's good.
Old woman, you and your husband
are educated, let me tell you.
l want you to answer one question.
The two of you all.
What's the area of a triangle?
You can't talk?
You'll lose everything
in the house here.
All!
And losers will die.
l'll give you one more chance.
Only one more.
How much is ten to the third power?
Ten to the third power is one thousand.
To the sixth power is one million.
As for the surface of a triangle,
it is equal to the base multiplied
by the height and divided by two.
Now, please,
just leave us alone.
We've given you everything.
What? What do you have?
With all your gold and diamonds!
What's your job?
You better shut up!
- l'm a high-school teacher.
- High-school teacher?
You fucking Dogo woman.
You think you smarter than me?
l was in the second grade,
but I took third-grade lessons.
With all the books you know,
your country is finished.
My wife isn't Dogo,
she's from your tribe.
- Don't hurt her.
- Prove it!
l'm the one who's Dogo.
You speak my dialect?
l only speak English,
l wasn't born here.
My father was an ambassador.
Ambassador?
So you understand our dialect?
Of course.
Prove it!
l give you two minutes.
- Kill them!
- Let's split!
They're boring,
there's nothing to loot.
Let's go loot other houses!
Time is up.
Time finished.
Too bad you were born abroad.
Next time you be born here!
l don't give a damn,
l love my husband.
So you insult my general?
Watch it or l'll blow your head off!
You can kill me,
but don't touch my wife.
Shut up!
- Stand up!
- That's an order!
You supported the stupid president!
Collaborators!
Hey old man!
- Get undressed!
- Make it fast!
- Dogos are traitors!
- Fast!
You'll fuck your wife,
right now, in the living room!
- Take off your fucking clothes!

Trousers off!
Put them down.
Now fuck for me now!
Quick! Quick!

You wanna die, old man?

You do whatever you want with me?
Let's go, Johnny!
l'm gonna kill you.
Who the fuck is she?
Take the weapon.
- Good morning, general.
- Where are your men?

Why ask me that?
Soon, you'll turn in your weapon.
We don't want boys with arms.
Find something else to do!

to serve as security

Who your little brother?
You killed him.
You think l can kill a child?
l saw you kill a little boy,
for oranges.
How do you know l killed a boy
for oranges?
lt wasn't for oranges l killed him.
He fired at my pickup
and was trying to escape.
We captured him in the old town.
l asked him what was in his bucket.
He said bananas and l kicked
the bucket and it was oranges.
He tried to escape
and l killed the man.
lf l had met him on the front
he would have killed me too.
Was he your brother?
So who says

they won't get rid of you?
You like it?

You go to Sunday church
to worship Jesus Christ?
You're a virgin!
And you?

Raping is not the same as loving.
You're not talking?
You started the talking, talk now.
Now you're scared.

Talk again.
Talk now!
Go away!
