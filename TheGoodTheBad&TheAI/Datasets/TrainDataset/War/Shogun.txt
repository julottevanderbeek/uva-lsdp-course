NARRATOR".
In the year of Our Lord 1598,
five trader warships left
the Dutch city of Rotterdam
as the first expeditionary force
ever sent
to ravage and plunder
Spanish and Portuguese possessions
in the recently discovered
New World.
Protestant Holland had been
at war with Catholic Spain
with England her only ally
in the struggle.
The Spanish had discovered
the vast riches of the Americas
and, legend had it, the even greater
riches of mysterious Cathay.
Both Holland and England were
determined to share in this wealth.
Only one Dutch ship
survived the violent storms
to breach the enemy's secret
of the Straits of Magellan
and finally
sail into American waters:
the Erasmus.
Under the command
of Pilot-Major John Blackthorne,
with only 28 men
of his Dutch crew still alive,
the Erasmus
ventured into the Pacific.
There, pursued and outnumbered
by Spanish fleets, her retreat cut off,
this ship turned westward
and fled alone...into the unknown.
Now, almost two years
outward bound from home,
Go below, pilot. I take this watch.
- Where's the mate?
- Dead.
There's the stink of death, pilot.
- What's the course?
- Wherever the wind takes us!
And where's the landfall
you promised?
Where's the Japans?
- Ahead!
- Ahead...
Always ahead!
Blessed Jesus...
Damn the day I left Holland!
- Get aloft, Maetsukker.
- No, I'm near death, pilot.
I'm sick. The scurvy's taken me.
Get aloft and stay there till you're dead
or we make landfall!
How are you feeling, Johann?
Good enough, pilot.
Perhaps I'll live.
Most men your age are already dead,
so you're ahead of us.
It's the saintly life I've led.
That and the brandy--
The boatswain's dead, pilot.
Get the body aloft.
You and Roper and Croocq.
Johann, take the dawn watch.
- Ginsel, you're bow lookout.
- Right.
Captain-general?
Where...? Where are we?
Still on course.
You and your damned course.
There is no Japans.
But you... You will kill us all.
We'll get there. We'll make landfall.
It's a lie.
All lies from the beginning.
God rot you, pilot.
Reef!
Reef ahead!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
We're lost! Lord Jesus help us!
Get the crew on deck!
Go on!
Get out on deck! Out!
Get aloft! The forecastle's ho!
Aloft!
Reef!
Reef ahead!
Turn, you whore from hell!
Turn, damn you!
Turn!
Is this the Japans?
The Japans?
It is the Japans.
By God, it has to be.
Sorry.
Where are my boots?
Boots.
Feet. Boots.
Thank you.
My name John Blackthorne.
What's your name?
Blackthorne.
What's your name?
Can you take me in your boat
to my ship?
You wait here for me.
Wait here for me.
But this is my ship.
There are papers in my cabin.
I need them.
I, me, want to go in there.
SEBASTIO: Who are you?
- Who are you?
I am Father Sebastio.
And you are a heretic
Dutchman pirate.
How did you get here?
We were blown ashore.
- What is this place? The Japans?
- Yes.
The authorities know about you.
They crucify criminals
and pirates here.
You're going to die.
- Where's my crew?
- They will die with you.
May God burn you in hellfire
for all eternity.
Kasigi Omi-san wants to know
where do you come from?
What's your nationality?
- Who is he?
- The samurai in charge of this village.
You'd better answer quickly.
Tell him I'm English. I'm pilot-major
of the Erasmus out of Rotterdam.
Omi-san says you may walk around
the village until his master comes back.
Lord Kasigi Yabu
will decide your fate.
What about my crew?
Where are they?
Omi-san says,
"Do you understand?"
What's "yes" in Japanese?
By the Lord Jesus, pilot,
you're alive.
Where's the ship? ls she safe?
Anchored in the bay.
Where are the others?
Dead, pilot.
The savages took them away.
Captain-general?
He can't hear you.
All he does is lie there and moan.
He's in God's hands. We all are.
- Is it the Japans, pilot? ls it'?
- Aye, it is.
But there's a priest here. A Jesuit.
Where there be one priest,
there's bound to be others.
Priests and papists...
They'll burn us at the stake.
The Day of Judgment approaches.
We never should've sailed here.
Are there riches, pilot?
ls there gold?
- There must be. Gold and riches--
- Did you see it?
- Have you seen the gold?
- No.
Maybe Roper's right. Maybe it's
only greed that brought us here.
- It's God's punishment--
- Stop it.
We're the first ones to reach Japans,
and we'll be rich if we keep our wits.
How? By trading with the devil?
It's always the devil with you,
isn't it, Jan Roper?
The devil lives on your lips.
Look to your soul, Johann Vinck.
Will they let us back on the ship?
Will they let us go now?
- The ship is under guard.
- Guards?
Are the heathens aboard?
What are we to do?
We must get away from here.
This is the land of Satan.
Hold your tongue.
We'll do whatever we can.
Their chief is coming soon.
Then we'll settle everything.
Do you think he'll let us go?
Why shouldn't he?
We've done them no harm.
Look at the way
they all smile and bow.
They're not bloodthirsty heathens,
are they, pilot?
Are they?
- It's the same swill as before.
- Raw fish.
How do they expect us to cook it
with no fire?
- He wants you, pilot.
- Maybe the chief is here.
- Tell him we come in peace.
- I'll do what I can.
- He wants all of us.
- I'm not going with that devil.
Roper, you and Pieterzoon,
bring the captain-general.
- He's dying. Let the poor man lie.
- Do as I say.
I'll bring him, pilot.
- Bow to him.
- He's a heathen savage.
The daimyo, Kasigi Yabu, Lord of lzu,
wants to know how you got here.
- By Magellan's Pass.
- Liar.
Magellan's Pass is secret.
You came by Africa and India.
The pass was secret.
A Portuguese sold us a rutter,
a pilot's chart book from his ship.
Liar.
Soon all our ships will know the way
through to the Pacific.
Heretic lies.
But you'll tell the truth soon enough.
They use torture here.
Lord Kasigi Yabu asks what acts
of piracy you have committed.
None. We are not pirates,
we come in peace.
- Another lie.
- Give him my answer, damn you.
- God curse you forever.
- Tell him we're not pirates, Jesuit pig.
Lord Kasigi Yabu says
your pirate ship is confiscated.
You papist liar. You lied to him.
You filthy lying Jesuit.
- God. Sweet Jesus' death.
- We should all pray.
- Vinck just did.
- I'm sick.
- I've got to lie down.
- Don't touch the captain-general.
- He's dying anyway.
- I said you don't touch him!
Shut up! All of you, shut up!
- Get off my foot.
- Are they going to kill us, pilot?
Lord Kasigi Yabu has graciously
spared all your lives.
All except one.
One of you is to die.
You are to choose who it will be.
But you, pilot,
you are not to be the one chosen.
Lord Jesus help us.
- What are we to do now, pilot?
- I don't know.
How?
How are we to choose someone?
We don't. We fight them.
With What?
Give them the captain-general,
he's useless anyway.
- You make a man sick--
- They'll take none of us without a fight.
If we fight, they'll kill us all.
You heard what he said.
All our lives are spared except one.
How do we choose?
We don't, damn it.
Pilot,
this doesn't concern you
anymore.
It's between us now.
It's our decision.
Aye.
We'll draw lots. Straws.
One shorter than the rest. Agreed?
What about the captain-general?
He wasn't excluded.
- Then let the last straw be for him.
- Who'll be the first to pick?
How do we know that the man who
picks the short straw will go? Huh?
How do we know that?
We'll all swear to God.
A holy vow. I swear it.
- I swear.
- I swear it.
I swear to God.
God be praised.
- Not without a fight.
- But we agreed.
I didn't.
It's all right, pilot.
We agreed. It was fair.
It's God's will.
- Nobody is going without a fight.
MAETSUKKER: You'll get us all killed.
BLACKTHORNE:
Help me! Come on! For your lives!
No! No, it's not me!
I'm not the one to go!
Help me! For God's sake!
I was going.
I swear before Christ, I was going.
Pieterzoon...
Why did they leave him?
They could've carried him away.
- Maybe they thought he was dead.
- He will be, soon enough.
Are you all right, pilot?
Vinck,
we won.
Aye, we did.
It was Hans Pieterzoon they took.
No!
No! Oh, my God!
No! Oh, my God!
No!
This poxy heathen's awake.
Come on. Get up.
Move!
Up!
- What shall we do with him?
- Kill him.
No. Maybe we can trade him
for something.
Look at the way he's just squatting
there, like he don't see nothing.
Pieterzoon...
God in heaven.
SEBASTIO:
Pilot, you are to come up alone.
What do they want with me?
I don't know,
but you must come up at once.
What happened to my man,
to Pieterzoon?
He's dead.
May God have mercy on his soul.
Pilot, you must come up.
They can have me instead.
Tell them me, not him.
SEBASTIO:
Pilot.
- What did he say?
SEBASTIO: It's a saying.
"A man's fate is a man's fate,
and life is but an illusion."
- What the hell do you want with me?
- Mind your manners, I warn you.
Tell this poxy bastard that I'm a lord
in my own country. Tell him.
He says he does not care
if you are a king in your own country.
Here you live at Lord Yabu's whim.
You and all your men.
Tell him to go to hell.
"If you do not agree to behave,
another of your men
will be brought up."
What does he mean, "behave"?
It means to obey. Obey totally.
Tell him I piss on him
and his whole country.
And his Lord Yabu.
- No, I can't.
- Tell him exactly.
No, you can't.
CROOCQ:
No!
Help, please! Please!
No! Please!
Tell him...
Ask him to stop.
CROOCQ:
No! Please!
- Do you agree to behave?
- Yes, I agree.
He wants you to answer
directly to him.
The Japanese for yes is hai.
He says, "Will you obey all orders?"
Hai, as far as I can, hai.
Omi-san says lie down.
Immediately.
He says he did not
insult you personally,
and there was no cause
for you to insult him.
But you must be taught manners.
- Do you understand?
- Tell him I understand.
You must tell him yourself.
He says it was bad manners
to say what you said.
Very bad.
Do you understand?
Get up.
What about the boy?
Croocq.
Croocq, lad.
- Is the boy all right?
- He's alive.
Omi-san says
you are to go with Muraji.
You will obey his orders.
He said that the lives of your crew
depend on your behavior.
If you fail to obey,
they will suffer. Clear?
Yes.
He says that since your name
is difficult to say,
from now on
you will be called Anjin.
That means "pilot."
Omi-san wants you to know
that this is not meant as an insult.
If you say so.
Oh, no. No, I don't...
Like hell.
A bath will make you foul sick.
Get out of my way.
Sweet Jesus.
Yes. Yes.
NARRATOR". Lord Yabu's pleasure
at having the barbarian as his prize
The galley that was rounding
the headland
depended on neither wind
nor tide.
And on its sail was the crest
of Lord Toranaga.
General Toda Hiromatsu,
was standing on the deck.
The barbarian ship
calmly at anchor in front of him.
Pilot.
- You must wake up.
- What?
You must greet him.
Say konnichiwa and bow.
- You must say "Omi-san."
- Why?
San means honorable.
It is an insult if you leave it off.
Say it quickly and bow.
You must get dressed quickly.
- Is she his wife?
- Wife? No.
- Who is she?
- The woman is a harlot.
A common whore
and damned for all eternity.
A slave ship.
You can't stop now.
Not if you want to live. Come, pilot.
Anjin.
Anjin-san.
Anjin-san.
No, I'm not going on a slaver.
It's a damned slave ship,
and I won't set foot on it.
It's a God-cursed slaver,
and you'll never make me go onboard!
RODRIGUES:
Madonna, leave him alone.
Did you hear what I said?
Leave him alone.
- Are you the pilot of the Dutchman?
- Aye. Who are you?
Good. I'm Vasco Rodrigues,
pilot of this galley, at least on this trip.
That's better.
Listen, pilot,
that man is like a king.
I told him I'd be responsible for you
and that I'd as soon blow your damned
head off as drink with you.
Now bow to the bloody sama.
You do that like a Japper.
Are you really the pilot?
Aye.
- What's the latitude of The Lizard?
- Forty-nine degrees, 56 minutes north.
And watch out for the reefs
that bear south by southwest.
Ha, ha. You're the pilot, by God.
Come aboard.
There's food and grog and all pilots
should love all pilots, amen, right?
- Right. But where are you taking me?
- Osaka.
The Great Lord High Executioner
himself wants to see you.
- Who?
- Toranaga,
Lord of the Eight Provinces,
whatever the hell they may be.
He's the chief daimyo
of this whole bloody country.
- What does he want with me?
- How the hell would I know?
But if he wants to see you,
by God he'll see you.
Now give them a nice little Japper bow
and on you go.
- Your ship's confiscated, inglés.
- Confiscated?
- What about my crew?
- Oh, they'll be all right.
There's nothing we can do
about it now. You'll just have to wait.
You can never tell with the Jappers.
They're all six-faced and three-hearted.
Madonna,
she looks fast, your ship.
- Where was she built, Rotterdam?
- Aye.
Could we go aboard her?
I'd like to collect my gear
and you could have a closer look.
I'll blow your head off, inglés,
if you trick me.
I give you my word, pilot to pilot.
And I'll swear
on your mother's virtue.
I'm beginning to like you, inglés.
Hey!
Ima it is. lma means "now, at once."
We're to leave at once.
- Ask him if I can go aboard my ship.
- No, I won't ask him a poxy thing.
- I have your word?
- You have it.
Come on.
There's a boat down there, inglés.
Don't move fast. Don't look around.
Don't listen to anybody but me. Go.
Don't worry, Captain-san,
I am responsible.
Sit there.
Not to worry, Captain-san.
You get ship ready.
Watch them carefully,
tell me what they're doing.
- The bowmen are taking out arrows.
- Are they getting ready to shoot?
Yes, they... No, wait.
- The captain's talking to them.
- Damn all samurai anyway.
- Why?
- They love to kill, inglés.
They even sleep with their swords.
They fear nothing, least of all death.
If a samurai's lord says kill, he kills.
If their lord says die,
he'll slit his belly open just like that.
I saw Omi-san kill a man
just because the man didn't bow.
You better remember that, inglés.
The samurai rule everything here.
They have the right to kill non-samurai
whenever they feel like it.
Man, woman, or child,
it doesn't matter.
They all serve their master.
That's what the word means.
Samurai means "to serve."
And if you forget your bloody manners,
heh, they'll serve your head up for you.
- I didn't see you bow and scrape.
- Ha, ha.
That's because I'm me,
Rodrigo-san.
I am important
because I act important.
They understand that.
Here, you don't ask, you act.
Of course, sometimes
you get killed if you act wrong.
Right.
BOW like I did.
Right, let's go and get your gear.
Well, not for me, it isn't bloody kinjiru.
I am Rodrigo-san.
to Toda Hiromatsu-sama.
I'm from Toda Hiromatsu-sama,
who's a bigger king than your bugger.
And Toda-sama's
from Toranaga-sama,
who's the biggest bugger
in the world.
Get ready to abandon ship.
Toranaga-sama!
Toranaga-sama!
That's bloody well better.
Those sons of plague-infested lice.
They've taken everything.
God curse all Jappers.
Well, since there's nothing here,
why don't you take a look
at the ship?
- Where are they,
- What?
Your charts. You've hidden them.
That's why you came onboard.
No pilot would worry about clothes.
You came for your rutters.
You want me out so you can get them.
You're right,
that's why I wanted to come.
But they were in here.
Oh, I don't want to steal them.
I just want to copy a part or two.
- They were in the sea chest.
- Liar. Come on, there's no time.
I took your word,
now you take mine, pilot to pilot.
I won't steal them.
Damn!
Stolen.
What?
Eh, I think so.
This was where you kept them?
- Yes.
- Everything?
Even your Portuguese rutter? Ha, ha.
Come on, it had to be Portuguese.
- How else would you have got here?
- Yes, even the Portuguese rutter.
That's gone too.
Halfway around the Earth
and no way to get home.
Lord give me strength!
I know what you feel, inglés.
I feel sorry for you.
It happened to me once.
Heh. May his ship drown
and he burn in hell forever.
Come on, let's get back to my ship.
You never saw a slaver
move like this.
Even with an infidel Turk
whipping them to a lather.
Those are samurai rowers.
They'll stroke till they die,
if Lord Toranaga wishes.
How far is this place
you're taking me?
Osaka? Oh.
Three hundred-odd sea miles,
and we'll be there
in less than 4O hours.
Hey, Captain-san.
West-southwest.
I guess you know your compass,
inglés.
These galleys normally
hug the coast for safety,
but that would take too much time,
and time is important.
Toranaga asked me to pilot Toda
to Anjiro and back quickly.
- I get a bonus if we're on time.
- You work for Toranaga?
Me work for him? Hell, no.
I was just visiting Osaka, my captain
and me. This was just a favor.
They're not great ocean sailors,
the Jap men.
Great pirates and fighters
and coastal sailors,
but the deep frightens them.
- What are they going to do with me?
- Whatever they want to do.
- What's your own ship like?
- Oh, heh.
I'm the pilot of...
I keep forgetting
that you're the enemy, inglés.
- We've been allies for centuries.
- But we're not now.
Go below, inglés. Get some rest.
If you want to sleep, use my cabin.
You're tired and so am I.
Tired men make mistakes.
- How do you feel,
- Rested.
- What do you think?
- I think there'll be a storm.
- When?
- Before the day's out.
Ha, ha. Now, that is a safe guess.
If this were your ship,
what would you do?
How far is the nearest land?
Oh. Three, maybe four hours.
If we run for cover,
it'll cost me my bonus.
Oh, Madonna. I'm a tired man.
Then go sleep,
I'll take the watch for you.
If the wind changes,
I'll wake you.
All right, inglés. I think I'll trust you.
God knows why.
Maintain this course. At the next turn,
go four degrees more westerly,
and at the next, six more westerly.
Ha, ha, hai.
Four degrees westerly it is.
Go below. Your bunk's comfortable.
Ah, priest, what have you given me?
God curse me and my lack of wits.
There's a storm there, all right.
This craft won't take much water.
- How was your sleep?
- Short.
But more than I would've had
if you weren't here.
- It can't be tai-fun.
- What?
Tai-fun, huge winds.
Worst storms you've ever seen.
- We're not in the tai-fun season.
- When's that?
It's not now, enemy.
It looks rotten enough.
I'll take your advice and head for land.
- Steer north by west.
- North by west, aye.
Hey, Captain-san.
What's that,
"Hurry up"?
Ha, ha. There's no harm
in you learning a little Jap man talk.
You need about ten words
and then you can make them dance.
That's if they're the right words.
And if they're in the mood.
maybe you learn too damn fast.
Go forward. Get them to start bailing.
Make them understand.
Hurry. Hurry.
Ship oars! Stop rowing!
Stop rowing!
- What do you think,
- You'll do what you want.
But she won't take much water.
We'll go down like a stone.
Next time I go forward,
tell me you're putting her into the wind.
Ah, that was the hand of God,
inglés.
A wave slapped her rump around.
We'll keep her into the wind.
When the time's right,
we'll make a stab for the shore.
My nose tells me
if we turn and run, we'll flounder.
If we don't turn, we'll never make it.
For God's sake, what would you do?
Wait till we're past the headland,
fall off from the wind and make
the rowers pull for their lives.
- That's dangerous.
- I know.
All right.
I'll go forward,
you take the helm.
Watch me, and when I signal,
go west-northwest for the shore.
- Watch me very closely.
- I will.
Hey.
You'll watch for my order,
and obey my orders.
Do you want me
to take the helm or not'?
I have to trust you again, inglés.
And I hate trusting you.
Steady as she goes.
Hard aport...now!
Hard aport, aye!
Pull, you buggers.
One, two, one, two.
One, two, one, two.
One, two-- Aah!
Damn you, Rodrigues!
Rodrigues.
Rodrigues.
Yabu-san.
Thank you for saving his life.
Thank you for your courage.
Thank you,
you black-eyed son of a whore.
You may come up one by one.
You may live
in the world of men again.
But break any rule,
and you'll be put back.
What about the pilot?
What's happened to him?
If you don't come out now,
you will stay down there.
- Where's the other man?
- Captain-General Spillbergen's dead.
God rest his soul.
He's down there lying in the filth.
Omi-san wants you to bow to him.
He wants us to come. Come on.
So now I owe you a life, inglés.
Oh!
God curse you.
It was Kasigi Yabu who saved
your miserable body. Curse him.
No. Those Jappos would never have
come after me if it weren't for you.
The curse is thine.
There's a bottle of grog over there.
Here.
You make a foul nurse, inglés.
It's your black heart.
Bring the bottle over here.
- How do you feel?
- Better.
Considering my head's on fire
and my mouth tastes of pigswill.
Eh-eh-eh.
Just give me the bottle.
This, uh, Toranaga,
- why does he want to see me?
- I don't know.
By the Blessed Virgin,
I don't know.
And since I owe you something,
here's some truth in part payment.
Never forget the Jap men
are six-faced and have three hearts.
So be careful, inglés.
Be careful what you say.
Be careful how you move.
Even be careful how you think.
Especially with Toranaga.
Toranaga...
What's he like?
Same as the rest of them.
Only worse.
They had 600 years
of civil war in this country,
until about 35 years ago
when Goroda conquered half of Japan
and made himself
ichi-ban lord of the country.
Know who helped him? Toranaga.
Then, I guess it was 16 years ago,
one of his own generals killed Goroda
and another stepped into his sandals.
General Nakamura.
Know who helped him?
- Toranaga.
- Right, inglés. Toranaga.
Another big monkey-sama, lshido.
Toranaga in the east,
lshido in the west.
Sooner or later
there'll be another bloody civil war.
Madonna,
I think I got drunk last night.
- Where are we?
- On course, pilot.
You're the pilot now. Ha, ha-- Ooh.
A person could think
that was funny.
You're supposed to be the prisoner.
You could be taking us anywhere.
But you, you wouldn't do that.
If they were taking me
to lshido's castle,
I wouldn't sail them there.
Ishido? I thought they were
taking me to Toranaga.
So they are. Except that
Toranaga's in Osaka Castle,
and Osaka Castle belongs to lshido.
And what a butcher he is.
Hell, they all are. Everything
in this country's upside down.
- What are you steering?
- South by southwest.
How did you know?
Who told you?
- You did.
- Me?
Madonna, it's all in a haze.
You looked in my rutter!
Ah, inglés, life is so strange.
And if I live,
it is by the grace of God,
helped by a heretic
and a Jap man.
There's the sod-eating sama.
I'd better go and thank him.
You're a dangerous man, inglés.
Maybe we'd all be better off
if they killed you.
NARRATOR". Osaka,
the white castle city of Lord lshido.
An escort of 2O samurai
was on the dock,
wearing the brown uniform
of Toranaga's army,
under the command
of Toranaga's youngest son,
Now, inglés,
it's Toranaga's fifth son.
That should keep him happy.
Come on.
Now what's the matter?
You're staying onboard, inglés.
- Why?
- It wouldn't do any good to ask.
When Toranaga's ready,
you'll find out.
And you.
