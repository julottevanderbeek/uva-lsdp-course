The Beaufort Castle,
a twelfth-century Crusader fort,
has passed from hand to hand,
from army to army,
for hundreds of years.
Bloody battles have turned it into
a mythological symbol of bravery.
In 1982, on the first day
of the Lebanon War,
the Israeli flag was raised
on the mountain
at the end of a fierce
and controversial battle.
Eighteen years later,
in the wake of public protest,
the Israeli government decided
to leave Lebanon.
Incoming, incoming.
Impact, impact.
Get in, it's not over yet.
Did you come to save us?
I知 Oshri.
The company sergeant.
This is Liraz, the outpost
commander. Welcome to Beaufort.
Ziv Faran. Bomb Squad.
- Nice to meet you.
Is it like this all the time?
- It was quiet until you arrived.
Impact. Impact.
See that doorway, over there? That's
the entrance to the protected area.
Sprint to it
and don't stop for anything.
Even if you hear, "Incoming,
incoming," keep running.
Got it?
Let's go. Get up.
Go. Run.
Got stuck?
Want to wait a moment?
No, it's okay.
Let's go.
Incoming, incoming.
Impact, impact.
Bardelas Leader,
what a guest!
Meet Ziv from the
Bomb Squad.
He'll hang around here for a few
days, to open the road for us.
Pavel, Robbie.
Pavel, go to the J-curve.
Right.
J- curve.
Have a seat.
That's the road...
- Can you see the device?
Not really.
It's around here.
Well hidden.
Bomb camouflage. They got
that from us. It's IDF. - May I?
Yeah, sure.
They put them there under
our noses. Ballsy bastards.
I don't know what blew up on
you, but this looks hot to me.
Impossible.
I was there. There was an explosion,
I saw it with my own eyes.
Could they have come back
and reset the device?
No. Impossible.
Robbie and Pavel have been
observing it since the event.
We have tapes.
Anything's possible.
We're ineffective in fog. We had
a few hours with no visibility.
Wait, what's the problem?
I don't get it.
The device has looked like this
for two weeks.
Your people have seen
all the pictures.
You drove us nuts in debriefing.
There's nothing new here.
Look, no one
has actually seen it.
We know nothing
about the parameter.
Chances are there's more than one
device. It's really dangerous.
Is that what they sent you for?
To tell us it's dangerous?
I know it's dangerous.
Believe me, I know.
I want to talk to my commander.
I think we should
cancel the operation.
What do you mean, cancel?
We can't stay here
with a blocked road.
We waited a month for you only
to hear that it's dangerous?
Look, I知 sorry
I have to disappoint you.
I know you guys
want to go home.
But... Kabarnit Procedure
isn't appropriate here.
I知 not doing it.
What do you mean,
you're not doing it?
Where did that come from?
It's dangerous.
It's not a game.
- Listen, Ziv.
You want to talk to your
commanding officer, fine.
Check with him, consult,
that's cool.
But "I'm not doing it?"
Where did that come from?
Who's asking you?
Liraz...
If you don't do it,
they won't cancel it.
They'll just bring in someone
else to do it in your place.
Do you have a red phone here?
Talk to whoever you want.
They know everything you do,
and they sent you here anyway.
Can I have a moment alone?
Come on.
Why don't they just send in
a D9 armored bulldozer?
Seriously.
Why send in a man on foot?
They want to investigate
the device, not blow it up.
It's rare,
to find a whole device.
Even so,
it seems totally crazy to me.
That's his job, Oshri.
Disposing of bombs.
What do you want?
They'll send him back home.
Wanna bet?
No way.
- I'm telling you.
Okay.
We're on.
Cigarette?
I don't smoke.
Want to start?
Ziv.
Ziv.
You awake?
Come on, let's go up
to the observation post.
Okay, give me a minute.
Ziv,
this is how you sleep
at Beaufort.
I値l wait for you up top.
No, thanks.
Don't let him get to you.
What was your name again?
Koris.
What's he like?
Do you guys like him?
Does it matter?
You're right.
Doesn't matter...
Liraz is exactly what the army
needs here now.
Someone who can't believe
they actually gave him the job.
Who's there?
- Ziv, bomb squad.
Ziv the bomb squad.
Come here,
let's have a look at you.
Have you seen Liraz?
I知 looking for him.
Liraz?
Not here.
Are you lost?
Where am I?
- Far away.
As far as you can get.
If you're here, it's by mistake.
Are you alone on watch here?
Shpitz, Ziv the bomb squad wants
to know if I知 here alone.
What's up, Ziv the bomb squad?
- Have you seen Liraz?
Why do you want Liraz?
What for?
Stay with us. We'll make you
a deluxe Beaufort toast.
Make you one? Pesto, cherry
tomatoes, Dijon mustard.
You like? -No, thanks.
He's waiting for me.
Good, because we're fresh out
of pesto and cherry tomatoes.
And mustard.
Say, bomb squad,
do they really teach you
to dismantle bombs?
How did you get to that unit, anyway?
Did you get there by mistake,
or did you want to go there?
Mostly by mistake,
but I知 not sorry.
You? Are you here by mistake,
or did you want to be here?
I wanted to be here.
That's the mistake!
Get it?
And what's it like?
Interesting?
What do you do here all day?
- Guard the mountain.
So it doesn't escape.
Have a nice shift.
Excuse me,
have you seen Liraz?
Soldier.
Soldier..?
Soldier...
What happened, buddy?
What's that thing there?
There's a dummy there.
Yeah, reinforcements.
"Spooks". There are six of them
dispersed over the guard posts,
to attract fire.
Are you serious?
What happened?
Did you talk to it?
That's good.
It means they're doing
their job, no?
Okay, let's go up,
I値l show you the road.
A bit to the right...
Arnoon. The device exploded
exactly in the middle.
On the curve.
Can you see it?
Sorry about earlier,
at the observation post.
I shouldn't have yelled
at you like that.
It's okay.
What did your commander
tell you when you spoke to him?
That it has to be done.
There's no alternative.
And that I should be careful.
Look, I wasn't trying
to get out of the job, earlier.
I spent a year at HQ,
waiting for this.
Yeah, but come the moment of
truth, your balls start shaking.
That's the way it is.
No way around it.
My balls aren't shaking.
I said what I did
because it's really dangerous.
What exactly are you
going to do there?
We go together
to the evaluation point,
I observe the device
and then go in,
with a medic behind me.
I make sure there's no trip wire
or device that could explode,
and if not, I go to the device,
dismantle it and take it with me.
Did they drill you on this?
Dozens of times.
And what if the device
explodes?
It's not supposed to.
Tell me, do your parents
know you're here?
Of course not.
What for?
They know I知 on the northern
border, but not inside Lebanon.
My mother hasn't known
where I am since I was nine.
Afraid to ask.
And you?
If my dad knew I was here, he'd
come and take me out by force.
I知 serious. He wouldn't
let me out of the house.
So you guys are serious
lefties, then?
Did you know they didn't even
need to take this mountain?
Had they waited until morning,
the terrorists would have run.
They could've come up
without battle or casualties.
You could say that
about any battle.
The fact is that the troops
fought here like men.
They even issued an order not
to conquer, not to come up here.
Oh yeah?
So why did they?
No one knows to this day. Somehow
the order disappeared into thin air.
Impossible.
My uncle was killed here in '82.
My mother's brother.
What, in the conquest battle?
From what I gather, fifty meters
from where we stand now.
Caught a bullet
as he entered the fort.
So what are you doing here?
Are you insane?
If I was your father, I wouldn't
let you out of the house either.
I壇 tie you to the refrigerator,
or something.
I致e been hearing stories about
this mountain my entire life.
I had to see it.
To be able to say I was
here, before we leave Lebanon.
You should have told me.
I壇 have sent you pictures.
Relax,
we're not leaving so soon.
I bet your kids
will still be here.
Maybe, as tourists.
- Maybe.
What is it?
- Liquorice.
My mother brings it
from Holland.
It's salty.
A little strong.
Bardelas from Leader.
Roger, over, Leader.
Copy stand down.
- Copy that.
Stand down.
Good morning. -Good morning.
Panther, Bardelas,
move to Tomato.
Roger. Tomato.
Ziv.
Identify it?
Send in the dog.
Nadav.
Thanks.
Okay, I知 going in.
Send me Koris.
I知 going in with you,
not Koris.
No way.
That's not what we agreed.
I don't care. I致e decided
that I知 going in with you.
That's not procedure.
- That's the way it's going to be.
It's a shame we're standing
here, exposed.
If you have a problem,
you can go back to the outpost.
Keep your distance, kid.
Go on, boy.
Come out my Beloved,
the Bride to meet;
the inner light of Shabbat,
let us greet.
To welcome the Shabbat,
let us progress,
for it is the source
from which to bless.
From the beginning,
chosen before time,
last in deed,
but in thought - prime.
Come out my Beloved,
the Bride to meet...
You know, they told us to start
getting rid of equipment.
When the convoy arrives tonight,
anything unnecessary, goes.
Bit by bit.
Until the evacuation.
No one gets rid of anything.
Not even a water boiler.
Not without my authorization. Got it?
I知 telling you
what they told us.
Anything that's not vital,
goes.
What's not vital?
Show me one thing
that isn't vital here.
The television,
for instance.
Why isn't it vital?
Why? Are you being punished?
Don't you deserve to watch TV?
There's no such thing as
not vital. Everything's vital.
If one thing's not vital here,
then everything's not vital.
I don't understand.
You don't have to understand.
You're early.
You have nine more minutes.
I saved you the drag
of the nine last minutes.
There's food.
Go eat.
A feast.
The cook outdid himself.
Idiots. Who prepares a meal
at midnight?
We also have permission
to shower.
Well, did you?
I知 on the ready team.
I値l shower tomorrow morning.
Also, they brought
new sleeping bags.
Brand new, from the factory.
I put one on your bunk.
What's up, Koris?
Everything okay?
Great. Perfect.
I知 not touching their food,
their sleeping bags
or their water!
It's like dancing on the blood.
Next time they should leave the road
closed. Shouldn't send anything.
It's killing me.
A man died here.
He came, said "Hi,"
and died.
And what for?
To open a shitty road
that only we use.
For a year I致e been keeping
my batteries upside-down.
Like an idiot.
So I don't waste them.
Turn them back only
before operational activity.
Fuck them now.
Stop it.
What, night alert procedure?
Think they can't see this post?
Think they don't know
you're here?
Bullshit. On the contrary.
You're here so they can see you.
What are we here for?
So that they know we haven't
run away yet.
Stop it, Koris.
This isn't a game.
What's this, Pavel?
Why is this on the truck?
I told you, that's the order.
Really,
I didn't make this up.
Take it off.
Forget the order. Are you nuts?
What do you mean?
Where are you going?
They told me to leave. No more
clearing roads on foot. -Said who?
Command.
Okay. Take it off. I don't care
what they told you.
Get him down.
What are you doing?
The dog isn't leaving.
Understand?
I don't care what they told you.
File a complaint. He's not leaving!
What's it to you? Who are you?
My orders are to leave
and no one sent a replacement for me.
The dog doesn't stay without me.
You're not my commander.
You can't make me stay.
Does it make sense to evacuate
a dog, but leave soldiers?
This dog stays here.
Understand?
Stop it, Liraz.
Stop it.
Move.
- It's not Nadav's fault.
He hasn't been home in a month,
and has no replacement.
There's no more road clearing
on foot.
So why keep him here?
What for? This is it.
It's over. Done.
We're holding up the convoy.
In a minute
there'll be missiles.
I don't care what they told you.
The dog stays, understand?
He's like a weapon. I can't
abandon him. No way.
So tell Command
it was my order.
Now get your stuff.
Get on the truck and fuck off.
Fuck off.
Go.
Get out of here.
I don't want to see your face.
Get out of my sight.
You don't deserve to be here.
Crazy bastard.
Go.
Go on,
back to the protected area.
Incoming, incoming.
Impact, impact.
Incoming, incoming.
Impact. Impact.
Wait, buddy.
Give it a few more seconds.
Incoming, incoming.
How many days
do you have left here?
Eighteen.
Including today.
Okay, listen. Why should you
dry out here for 18 more days?
Next convoy, go back to Israel.
You've done your share.
Where did that come from?
If you have something to say,
Liraz, say it.
I have nothing to say.
You've done your bit, man.
Get out.
Go say goodbye to the
kids before you leave.
Give them a tour a the fortress.
You sure?
- Yeah. Sure.
Come with me?
We'll bring them some goodies.
Let the kids run loose
a little bit.
Like Kalimi did to us
on our first tour of duty here.
Impact. Impact.
- You go.
At this point
I don't belong there.
But you go.
It's important.
Hold on a minute.
Put down the camera, Shpitz.
Photograph the landscape.
Not the people. We don't want to be
in tomorrow's newspaper.
Wow.
This was their bunker.
And this,
their guard post.
Soldiers have been on this damn
mountain for a thousand years.
But no mortar shells
fall here, right?
Never.
The fortress is sacred.
The Hezbollah
respect the Crusaders.
It's so quiet here.
Who's Michael?
- What?
Michael. Is there something
you want to tell us?
Michelle. Michelle,
asshole.
My girlfriend.
Lives in New Jersey.
I知 on a plane a day after
I知 out of the army,
land on her doorstep
twelve hours later.
Are you sure that's
how you spell Michelle?
Don't mess with my head. I知
sure, I checked a million times.
One more word and I値l have you
studying English all night.
If you checked, it's cool.
Doesn't matter. She'll leave you
after a week anyway.
You're not cut out
for an American.
Watch it, Kundalini!
Besides, her dad's Israeli.
Even worse.
Say, what about Liraz?
Does he have a girlfriend?
Lilach.
Six years together.
You seen her?
Do you guys hang out together?
- Sometimes. Not much.
What's he like?
Not much of a dancer.
I can't see him dancing,
with his M16...
What, are you making fun
of him?
I just can't imagine him being
romantic. Dunno. I just can't.
Truth is, he's not
all that big on romance.
How could he be romantic?
Last year I saw him
on the street, in Tiberias,
in jeans, with his gun
slung around his shoulder.
What kind of jerk
carries his weapon on leave?
Did he see you?
Did you say hi?
He pretended not to see me.
Crossed the street.
What did you expect? For him
to stop and give you a hug? -No.
But he could have nodded.
He knows me,
after all.
At the outpost
he doesn't say hi, either.
Why does he keep
such a distance from us, anyway?
What's the deal?
Are you guys short of friends?
Leave him alone.
What kind of a soldier was he?
Devoted.
A real workhorse.
From Day One he knew he wanted
to be an officer.
Took the test three times,
but was rejected.
They wouldn't let him in.
Said he wasn't officer
material.
So he drove the battalion
commander crazy.
Sat outside his office every
day, begged him for a chance.
In the end they let him
take the course.
He graduated with the top marks.
They couldn't figure him out.
Was he liked in your company?
Sure.
King of the world.
The soldiers, mind you,
not the commanders.
Why, don't you like him?
Sure.
He's a good officer.
You can tell he cares.
You're lucky they didn't stick
you with some faggot officer.
If something happens here,
you know you can count on him.
They didn't send him here
for nothing.
I知 here just because of him.
If he weren't here,
I could have finished
my service easy.
Every night out in Nahariya.
Everyone knows that if
something serious happens here,
he's the only one
who'll know how to function.
Like he functioned with Ziv?
Stop the bullshit, Koris.
What could he have done?
The guy died for nothing.
I swear.
And the next day, suddenly they
cancel Kabarnit Procedure.
Two days later they bring in
the D9, plow over the road.
So what did he die for?
I still don't get it.
Am I the only one
who thinks it's weird?
A good officer, who can function,
wouldn't let that happen.
Koris, he takes orders
just like you, okay?
He doesn't decide
when to send in the D9.
Think he makes those decisions?
And why aren't we allowed
to talk about the evacuation?
As if we were 3-year-olds?
- What do you want him to say?
about the army are brainwashing
the whole country
with their bullshit.
What's it got to do with you?
What do you want him to say?
- I want him to stand up like a man
and tell us that Hezbollah
will be here in two weeks.
And that all the IDF is doing
now is for nothing. That's what.
Okay, forget politics.
No, it pisses me off!
Someone died here. How can you
say it was for nothing?
You know what? Not for nothing.
You got your chow, okay?
Koris, I値l throw my helmet
in your face. -Okay, enough!
Suddenly the landscape
seems different.
I don't know why.
It's a well-known phenomenon.
When you're here long enough,
the view changes.
Suddenly you see new things.
It's just a new angle.
No, something changes
in your head, believe me.
You end up missing this place.
So when are you running away
from here?
I知 not running away.
Don't say that.
My time has come. -You're right.
That's cool. Sorry.
When are you
getting out of here?
In two days.
Come here,
give me a hug.
Come on,
don't be afraid.
You come to me.
When you're in New Jersey,
every night,
before you fuck Michelle,
think about us here
for one minute.
Picture this moment.
Swear you won't go a day
without thinking of us.
One minute.
That's enough.
Cool. It's a deal.
Take care.
- Okay.
Sure?
- Sure.
What?
Good luck.
- Thanks.
Hang in there.
Want me to cry?
Come on.
Get your gear.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Noah! -What?
In the ark
gather the forest animals...
In 21 days I値l kiss Michelle
on the lips,
do you believe it?
Are you with me,
Honey?
Ever hear of
Kundalini meditation?
It's a kind of snake
that lies coiled in your pelvis.
And you have to awaken it
from its dormant state.
If it awakens inside, it can
actually bring salvation.
And it calms your soul,
mends the broken pieces in your
heart. True spiritual life.
Want me to demonstrate,
Honey?
Kundalini, stage one:
stand with bent knees
and shake your body.
Shake it, shake it.
Relax, from the earth
to the sky.
I知 afraid, Master Shakura.
I can't relax.
Have no fear, I知 with you.
We're together.
Let it out of you,
naturally, freely.
Don't lead,
let yourself be led,
carried away. Yes, shake hard.
Shake hard.
Now, shake hard,
shake deep...
Impact. Impact.
Missile at Green Post.
Missile at Green.
Zitlawi!
Get an extinguisher.
And get the ready team
with a doctor.
Koris, get the ready team.
Come on, snap out of it!
Impact, impact.
Zitlawi! Zitlawi!
Incoming, incoming.
Impact. Impact.
Tell them we have an injury
or a casualty.
Where's the ready team,
why aren't they here?
Where's the doctor,
fuck it?!
Caesar from Bardelas medic.
We have an injury here.
Copy?
We got hit by a missile.
Liraz, here's the extinguisher.
Clear, clear!
Go in with you?
- Wait outside.
Oshri, get me Caesar.
Caesar from Bardelas Leader.
Incoming, incoming.
Caesar from Bardelas Leader,
we have an injury, copy?
A serious injury.
I need a helo ASAP.
Do you copy?
Over.
Zitlawi,
can you hear me?
What's the status?
Helo. Get a helo.
Don't tell me to calm down.
Motherfucker. -Got to get him
onto a stretcher. Get him down.
Support his head.
Get him up.
Get him up.
Impact, impact.
Support his head, Liraz.
Zitlawi,
can you hear me?
Be strong, kid.
I love you, man.
Take over for me
on the stretcher.
I知 on duty here
until the ready team arrives.
Stay here.
Keep your eyes peeled.
It could be a combined attack.
Where's the ready team?
Fuck.
Must be waiting
for the shelling to stop.
Go with Zitlawi.
Go.
I値l be back soon.
Keep your eyes open, Oshri.
Get up there, quick. What
are you doing here? Go! Up!
Ready Team B, go to the helipad.
Team B, status.
