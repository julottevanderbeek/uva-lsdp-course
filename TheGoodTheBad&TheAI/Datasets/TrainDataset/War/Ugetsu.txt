OF LEGENDS STILL ALIVE
IN ALL MEMORIES...
IS PULLED THIS MOVIE
SHOT IN A NEW STYLE.
The place: the region of the Lake Biwa.
The time: end of the 16th century
What's this noise?
Spies, probably.
It's necessary that I have this
before the fight begins.
Can you sell everything in Nagahama?
Yes. Hashiba's army arrival
brought prosperity.
Shall I come with you?
No! These soldiers
are without mercy for the women.
Besides who would take care of
Genitchi, our son?
You are stupid,
to dream such a thing!
The ambition, as the ocean...
must be without limits!
You a Samurai..?
You don't even know how to fight!
Continue working with my brother.
You will see!
In the name of the War god!
I have had enough, of misery!
I'll come with you.
Stop thinking about these madness.
I'll pull your cart.
Be reasonable.
No, my brother. He believes that glory
awaits him in in the city.
He is stupid!
They are mad, with their ideas,
Tobei Genjuro!
The so easily won money
fly off quickly.
It overexcites
the imbecile desires!
The war approaches.
They'd better prepare for it.
Say that to Genjuro.
Here's Dad coming home!
Look at that!
Can you imagine!
What a beautiful profit!
I came back in hurry,
to show it to you.
That's what i call trade!
Do you understand?
And Tobeï?
He followed a great Samurai,
Despite my advice.
Lord! Take me to your service.
I am brave.
Go away filthy beggar !
you would need an
armor.
And a spear.
And I could be a Samurai?
You are still there?
And your armor?
You are splendid ! Are you happy?
You are superb!
You make me so happy !
For years, I wanted
to buy you pretty things.
Finally, my dream
comes true.
I am so happy
to see you happy!
It is not because of the kimono...
but because of your love.
My only desire is to keep you close to me.
I also brought some supplies.
Smoked Fish... oil...
flour... rice cakes!
Without money, there is only misery.
And hope dies!
I want to bring back even more money!
I will work harder...
I will make masses of potteries!
Stop for now, Genjuro.
The chief of the village announces
the arrival of the Shibata army.
Stay home.
Stupid! The war is good for trade.
See that beautiful profit!
And if luck abandodonned you?
If something happened to you ..?
don't worry!
Here... Ohama!
My brother!
don't torment him.
No Samurai will hire
a poor peasant.
He will qickly come back!
Let's have a hot drink.
Idiot! Do you understand..?
Look at you...
the silliest of the whole village!
You can spin!
Send him away,
he embarrasses us.
Behave yourself, my boy.
Mom... I am hungry!
He irritates me!.. Let's go, spin!
You change so much!
You become irate.
I only want a thing:
to work together.
All three.
nothing else matters.
You work hard!
because I have a plan.
We will go to Nagahama.
And we will become rich!
I will have a share?
Of course! A third of the sale.
I need money so much!
I never saw them working like that.
They live only for this oven.
Bodies and soul! both of them.
If it fails,
what will they become?
what he has should be enough.
But no!
He was so quiet, until now!
War changes people so much!
don't antagonize them.
Listen!
Stand up, Genjuro!
That must be the Shibata army!
Tobeï, what's happening?
All the neighbors run away!
What shall we do?
the fire... It's going to die out...
It must not!
They arrive!
They are going to strip us!
Genitchi!..
The Shibata army is there!
The Shibata army... Run!
They will take the men!
If they had only arrived tomorrow!
Let's go, quickly, there is danger!
My fortune is in this oven!
But your life is lot more precious!
Take some rice! We will need
it in the mountain.
Ohama... Quickly!
Help..!
Spare our men,
or we will die of hunger!
Here, it's cooked.
We can eat.
What's happenning?
This Tobeï! What an idiot !
Didd you saw my husband?
No, nowhere.
Who's there..?
Everything has calmed down
We can't hear a thing.
Genjuros, where are you going..?
Patience!
They won't remain here long.
You'd better wait.
I can't, I have to leave.
We will be ruined!
Sacrify the batch!..
And if you were taken?
We can't let it die out!
We'll start again. Later!
I don't want to abandon my oven!
It died out!
No more hope.
Some must hide there.
Let's search everywhere!
Nothing but pots!
They are cooked!
Look... they are finished!
They are saved?
Yes, all cooked. Thanks Heaven!
Then, we return to the city?
This time, we will cross the lake.
Ohama is a good rower.
Let her come.
Can we arrive?
Yes, by taking a shortcut.
And the boat?
We will surely find one on the beach.
Careful, the fog is thick.
Genitchi, do you see the lake?
It is pretty.
Finally, out of danger!
Glad that we go there by water.
By the fields, we could have been killed.
In the morning, we will be in Omizo...
Where the castle of
the Lord Niwa is.
It is a much bigger city
than Nagahama.
We will be rich!
And our wives too!
I will have a
vast warehouse built.
I will buy an armor!
Look... a boat!
A ghost!
No, I am not a ghost.
But a fisher, from Kaïzu.
I have been attacked by pirates
while going... to Azuchi.
Water... please!
Wherever you go
watch out for the pirates!
They'll take your life...
and your goods...
and especially your women!
Buddha has his soul!
Let's go back home.
The danger is too big.
Let put the women ashore.
We will go alone.
I go there, to supervise you.
You will be kidnapped!
I'll take the risk.
Please, take me with you.
Think about our kid.
Turn around, Ohama... Faster!
We will come back money.
Before 10 days.
May the gods protect you!
Avoid the road,
take the mountain trails.
Stay away of the villages.
These misfortunes won't last.
Patience!
Be  careful all of you!
See you soon!
Take good care of Genitchi!
We will bring back a lot of money!
Dad!
Good luck!..
I will take this vase.
And this sake pot, and these two bowls.
These rice bowls and these plates.
And these pots.
Rice bowls, plates and pots.
We live in the Manor Kutsuki,
on the mountain.
Deliver them there.
We will pay you then.
Thank you, Madame..
Very well.
The Castle's guard! Make place!
I could be a samurai,
with an armor and a spear!
don't waste our money.
Do I look like a samurai?
Certainly!
But you need a spear.
You are superb!
Your salary!
Idiot!..
You see it, my misfortune..?
thanks to you,
your wife is reduced to that!
Be proud to have become a Samurai
at such a price!
Tobeï... Big fool..!
Would you watch over my stall?
My partner is coming back.
How much is it..?
Do you want to buy it?
If the price is right.
It is much too beautiful
for your wife!
But I have the money!
We thought
that it was better to guide you.
You are so good!
Follow us!
Move on!
Thank you, but I would like...
Dame Wakasa wants to
see you.
That is the princess's name?
She is the unique daughter
of the late Lord Kutsuki.
Do not fear... Enter!
Comwith me.
You are indeed Master Genjuro,
from the province of Ohmi?
How do you know it?
At the  market,
when I saw your ceramics...
I hardly believed my eyes!
These blue reflections seemed...
to be made of mother of pearl!
thanks to the lessons
taught by my father...
I am able to appreciate them.
How do you create such beauty!
Do you have a secret?
No special secret.
kneading and varnishing
require a certain knack.
what you realize
is a pure marvel!
Only, a true master craftsman
can create such a beauty!
Thank you, Madam..
But... these are my works!
I only want to use what you have made
What privilege, my dear kids!
Although it is only a distraction...
I always consider
my creations...
as my real children!
I am honored
that they are so appreciated...
in a such a decor...
and caressed
by such beautiful hands!
I am confused.
But I fear, by touching them...
to tarnish them.
Please drink.
Never my potteries
appeared so beautiful to me!
I would never have believed that
the decor had so much influence!
My children must feel constrained,
in your presence!
don't bury your talent
in a small village.
Enrich it, more fully
and more deeply.
But... how would I
be able to it?
By marrying Lady Wakasa!
Don't wait longer...
"The most beautiful
of chosen silks
"As would my life,
O Beloved ... "
How his voice seems happy!
It's my late father's.
The entire Katsuki Clan
has been annihilated.
Only my mistress, survived
that you see here.
And me, her nurse.
The soul of my Lord
remained here...
and HE sings...
every time that my
Lady dances.
This virile voice
it is not magnificent?
He is delighted
of my Lady's near marriage!
Every time that i hear it, I...
It is too early.
Remain in bed, my love!
Where am I..?
Would you have forgotten..?!
The Lord is awake?
Lead your beloved husband
to the source.
You don't need me
anymore!
You question me!
You take myself for a bad Angel,
don't you?
Never mind... you are mine!
Henceforth, you will obey me in everything ,
and you will be devoted to me!
It doesn't matter that you are a demon!
I won't leave you anymore!
I would never have imagined such pleasures.
It is divine!
It is the Paradise!
Give me something to eat.
Take these rice cakes.
Escape by the back... On the left!
And be very careful!
Do you have something to eat?
We burst hunger!
It is for my kid,
don't take it!..
Cut off my head!
I decapitated a
hostile general!
You found a valuable head.
I killed the man with my spear!
Who will believe that the freat warrior
Fuwa let himself killed by you!
However, I will leave you the credit of it.
Name your price.
A horse, an armor, and men.
Well. You will have all of it.
Thank you, Lord.
Your request pleases me!
Famous samurai!
Who is that great samurai?
He killed Fuwa, the great general!
What is his name?
Tobeï of Nakanogo,
famous in the Niwa army.
Come to see the pretty girls...
that want to amuse you!
What do you want..?
Master., let's stop here.
No, I'm going home!
There is someone there
that I want to dazzle!
Master.... be generous!
For your soldiers!
Well, I understand.
Tobeï of Nakanogo, of the Niwa army,
is going to take a rest.
Prepare rooms!
Which is Tobeï?
His big deed astonished me.
Can i drink in your cup?
How did you kill this general?
We would like some details,
to imitate you.
It is not much.
First, you need brains.
Then, physical strength.
I mean...
military science.
Finally, a broad view.
With all that, you will be as
capable as any great strategist!
But especially, use your brains!
Me, I became a master in strategy...
in the handling of the spear...
in construction of battlements...
and of fortresses!
Wait!.. And my money?
You are worse than a thief!
I never pay the likes of you!
Pig! To take advantage of me like that!
Well, that's better than nothing!
Ohama!..
So you are a great man now!
Finally became the samurai
of your dreams!
Me too, I succeeded.
I wear rich kimonos, and make up, I drink...
and I lie down!
Great triumph for a woman!
You must be happy of it!
The one that gets the glory
makes someone endure.
My fall is the price
of your ascension!
Be my guest tonight.
And pay me with the money your deeds won you!
Ohama!.. Without you,
my successes don't mean anything.
You lie! You never thought aboutme... Selfish!
I did, believe me.
I believed that you would admire me.
I never thought that you would fall to "that!"
I am a lost woman!
because of you!
Lets go back to our former life
Otherwise, I will kill myself!
Yes, we will go back to our former life.
How many times did I want to kill myself !
But before, I wanted to see you again.
I don't know why.
But I could not kill myself...
in spite of all my longing!
Well, this and this...
Can you lower your price?
If I remove that, yes.
No, come with me to the Kutsuki
manor, and I will pay you.
Kutsuki..?!
Yes, in the mountain.
Take everything... but leave!
I don't want your money!
Wait!
Who... me?
You're running towards your misfortune!
What misfortune?
Let me take a close look at you.
I must talk to you...
Follow me!
I see Death upon you.
Would you not have met a ghost?
Certainly no!
Do you have a house, a family?
In this case, go back home immediately!
You will die, if you remain here.
Leave, and quickly!
But why..?
because your existence is at stake.
I live happy with Wakasa
in the Manor Kutsuki.
Wakasa is a shadow!
You are engagedd in a forbidden love!
didn't you like yours?
What will they become without you..?
Wait!
Go there, if you must.
But i can't let you go to your death.
I want to protect you!
If you see how much this ghost
be horrible, you will be saved!
What a charming costume!
And these superb necklaces!
I am so happy!
You are indeed good.
What a relief!
I worried so much of your delay to go back!
But you look dark.
What happened?
Tell me, what it is.
We must not go out anymore
Since the fall of our clan,
everyone despises us.
People even calumniate us.
Genjuro...
I don't want to lose you!
Let's go together
to the region where i came from.
You, my only love!
Do you agree, my beloved?
Pardon me!
I lied to you.
I have a wife. And a son.
I abandonned them them to the horror of war.
Forget everything !
let me go back.
No... Never!
Come with me to the country
which is mine.
What's happening ?
Regarde... on his body!
Genjuros! You betrayed my love.
Wipe what is written
on your skin!
Why Did you married her,
being already married?
I don't know what drove me
to that fault.
For a man, it is a fault.
But for a woman...
Pardon me. And let me go!
Certainly not!
Wipe this prayer to Buddha!
to be forgiven.
Genjuro...
why such treachery?
How did you dare..?
I want to remain forever with you.
Be my only love... for eternity!
Wakasa had left this world...
before she could enjoy life.
I had mercy of her.
I wanted her to know
woman's pleasures...
The burning love of youth.
I took her out of her grave
and brought her back on earth.
And we found in you the man...
that she married by love.
Now, enjoys life.
If you leave her...
her happiness will be forever ended.
Won't your heart be crushed...
At the thought of destroying
her only source of joy?
Imagine your remorse, then!
Have mercy of Wakasa!
And renounce your idea.
You must forgive me!..
Up, dirty thief!
You stole the Treasure
of the Temple of Yatsuo.
You are mistaken! It is mine.
This sacred treasure disappeared
a month ago.
Absurd! It belongs to the Kutsuki manor.
What... Kutsuki?
You dream!.. Here are the ruins
of the old Kutsuki manor.
Enough idiocies!
Where did you find this?
Search him!
It is my money!
We would throw you in jail,
if it was not burnt.
Be thankful.
"The most beautiful
of chosen silks"
Miyagi!
Miyagi!
How worried you must have been!
I am so happy to see you in good health.
And our son?
He sleeps.
Kid, I came back!
Dad came back home!
I wanted to bring
something better.
But I was not able to.
I have... acted like a fool.
don't tell me more!
You are here, safe and sound.
When awakening...
my mind was upset.
don't continue.
You really must be tired.
I give you sake.
And here something to eat.
I am so happy!
The sake is better than ever.
What peace!
Son, I hand you in bed.
Not one instant of peace,
since my departure.
But I'm home... Finally!
Who's in there..?
Open the door!
The chief of the village!
Genjuro! You came back!
Thank you for all your goodness
whhile i was away.
Here you are kid!
I looked everywhere for you.
The kid must have heard about your return.
Miyagi!..
Genjuro... Are you dreaming?
Your wife... has been killed.
Killed..?
Yes. Poor soul, she would have been
so happy to see you back.
Since her death,
I kept your child at home.
I was so aafraid,
when he disappeared!
The voice of blood, it is marvelous!
How could he know that you were here!
You didn't understand your madness
until meeting your misfortune.
The war ruined all our hopes.
Let my sacrifice not be vain.
Be brave!..
Why did you die?
But you became
The man of my ideal.
Alas, I am not anymore
in the same world than yours.
You must be tired. Rest.
Kid, eat while it's hot.
You too, my brother!..
