Ragnar: Previously on "Vikings":
Without Jarl Borg's ships and warriors
we cannot hope to mount
a successful raid on Wessex.
We will find another ally.
I want my revenge on King
Ecbert and I shall have it.
Envoy: You need a new
ally to attack Wessex.
We can provide such an ally.
His name is Earl Ingstad.
Lagertha: Over a hundred warriors.
Will you accept me as an ally?
King Ecbert: Ragnar Lothbrok
is no longer alone
in attacking our shores.
If you and I join together,
we should surely overcome him.
Rollo: Why do you keep making
concessions to Horik?
Ragnar: Because he is the king.
Floki: Everything here is for Ragnar,
but he cannot have everything.
Siggy: Floki is angry with Ragnar.
Aslaug: I told Ragnar
if he forced himself on me
in the first three days of his return,
I would bear him a monster.

Sorceress:
Aslaug:
Siggy:
Princess Aslaug, listen to me.
You are in an open field.
On one side of you is a deep pit
filled with bones and ashes
and hellish things.
On the other side is your house,
your sons, the Fjord,
and the sunlight is striking the snow
high on the mountains.
If you want to reach your house,
then you must push the
baby out as Freya would.
Let him rip you, but push... Out.
Choose life.
- Siggy: Yes.
- Aslaug:
- Siggy: Yes.
- Sorceress: The baby will come.
Aslaug:
- Siggy: That's it! Good.
- Sorceress: I see the head.
Aslaug: Agggghhhhhhhhhhhh!
-
- Siggy: It's alive.
It is alive.
Sorceress: It's a boy.
King Horik: We must prepare
to go to Wessex.
Obviously, we must leave soon.
Lagertha: I have to return
to my territories.
I have to prepare my ships.
It will take some time.
King Horik: How much time?
Bjorn: Just enough time.
No more, no less, King Horik.
Porunn: Your father has a new child.
- Bjorn: A son?
- Porunn: Yes.
King Horik: I must congratulate
your father.
It is never a bad day to have a son.
The gods cannot stop
offering him their blessings.
Erlendur: I, too, am happy for Earl Ragnar.
King Horik: Erlendur.
Lagertha: Who are you?
Porunn: Porunn.
Lagertha: I meant, who are you to my son?
Bjorn: She is a servant. A slave...
And I am in love with her.
Ragnar: After all,
your prophecy was right.
King Horik: Don't be too long.
Lagertha: I won't.
King Horik: I need you.
If the three of us are equals,
we need each other.
But one cannot be more
equal than the other.
You mean Ragnar.
You and I are at least his equal,
and Ragnar must come to understand this.
I agree.
Siggy: Lagertha!
To keep you warm.
What is wrong with Ragnar's new son?
Siggy: Nothing. Be safe.
Lagertha: How loyal you are, Siggy.
Agh!
Don't die stupidly.
I'm not going to die.
Agh!
Rollo: Yes, you are! If I choose.
Agghhh!
Rollo: Fight!
Ugh!
Always remember to finish off
your opponent, if you can.
No man ever ran away
with his entrails hanging to his knees,
or his head cut off.
Rollo: Your mother is an amazing woman.
Bjorn: I know.
You were in love with her once.
Well, believe me, those
feelings are wasted.
Don't the gods love?
Who is to say their love is wasted?
How come you know so much about the gods?
Because my father, you and I...
Are all descended from Odin.
Or is that not true, uncle?
He will die anyway.
What is the point of pretending?
If we were wolves, or even pigs,
this poor, weak runt would be discarded.
We are not wolves or pigs.
Ragnar: It is natural.
We let such babies die for their own good.
For what kind of a life could he live?
I know, but I don't care.
Aethelwulf: Always so behind the times!
Athelstan: Well, that's true.
My work is for all eternity.
- Athelstan: Who is coming?
- Aethelwulf: Kwenthrith.
The daughter of Offa!
Athelstan: King of Mercia?
Aethelwulf: Well, before he died, that is.
Athelstan: Not his son?
Aethelwulf: Don't you know anything?
Kwenthrith killed her brother,
Offa's natural heir.
Now the whole kingdom is
beset by dynastic squabble.
Everyone is murdering everyone.
Athelstan: Presumably...
King Ecbert doesn't want to get involved
with such terrible squabbles?
Aethelwulf: Of course not.
My father has no interest whatsoever
in what happens in our neighboring kingdom,
which just so happens to be
the largest, most important,
and richest kingdom in England.
Athelstan: So this is our fratricide.
Our mass murderer.
King Ecbert: Welcome, princess,
to the Kingdom of Wessex.
There is no other way.
No other way, my son.
Women: Lagertha! Lagertha!
- Man: My lady.
- Woman: It is good to see you!
Einar: Welcome back, Earl Ingstad.
We've all missed your presence.
Lagertha: Thank you, Einar.
But you will have to do without my presence
a great deal longer.
It is agreed that I am to raid
the English kingdom of Wessex
with king Horik and Earl Ragnar.
I expect my ships to be provisioned
by the next full moon,
and all my warriors to be
armed and assembled.
Man and woman:
Kwenthrith: Oh, no meat for me.
I don't like it. It kills you.
Kwenthrith: Only vegetables.
Who are you?
My name is Athelstan.
I was a monk at Lindisfarne.
A monk!
King Ecbert: Athelstan was captured
by the northmen.
He's lived amongst them.
He knows everything about their pagan ways.
I have heard that the pagans
sacrifice human beings!
Is that true? Do they actually?
Every nine years, yes, they do.
To please their gods.
Kwenthrith: And are they naked?
I have been told that they make love
to whomever they choose,
and that the idea of fidelity
is utterly strange to them.
They have... A different morality to us.
Is it not more natural?
Athelstan: I...
Kwenthrith:
Is it not more natural?
Is it not more natural?
Is it not more natural?
Athelstan: I... I would only say
that it is different.
Kwenthrith: How boring you are!
King Ecbert: I was shocked to hear
of the death of your brother.
Kwenthrith: Oh, don't worry
about my brother.
Did you know that the Pope
has already made him a Saint?
Saint Kenelm!
Apparently, he lived an exemplary life!
King Ecbert: Do you mean to say that
he was not altogether virtuous?
Kwenthrith: Well, he raped me
when I was about twelve.
Bishop Edmund:
Kwenthrith: So you must make up
your own mind.
King Ecbert, I do not need to ask
why you've invited me here.
I know very well.
You want to influence
the destiny of Mercia.
My family are killing one another,
and you want to be on the side of the party
which succeeds to the crown.
You put it very precisely, princess.
It should not surprise you to hear
that myself and my allies will succeed.
But, perhaps, your support
would be an advantage.
King Ecbert: I was thinking of sending
my son, Aethelwulf,
to advise and help you.
I would gladly open my gates...
To your handsome son.
Aethelwulf:
King Ecbert: I would also like to hire
some northmen as mercenaries
to help you succeed in gaining
the throne of Mercia.
Kwenthrith: I need to meet these northmen
whose prowess, in all things,
I have heard so much about.
Heh.
It seems no one can talk
of anything else now.
King Ecbert: So let us drink...
-
- To princess Kwenthrith,
and the conquest of Mercia.
All: The conquest of Mercia!
Lagertha: Einar, why don't you come in?
Do you want to speak to me?
Einar: Yes.
Lagertha: Then wait.
Einar:
What do you want to say?
Einar: I thought we had an agreement.
I don't remember any agreements, Einar.
You do remember!
I would help you become Earl,
and then, as a result, we might be married.
Lagertha: I never made any arrangements.
Not with you, nor with anyone else.
You wanted rid of Sigvard
because he was insane.
So I killed him.
That's all.
Einar:
If you do not let me enjoy you,
I shall open your face!
Lagertha: And then... What
would your family do, hmm?
If they had any respect for you,
they would have made you Earl, not me.
The truth is, you couldn't kill me.
The only person you could
kill was a dying man.
That's how brave you are.
Siggy: Aslaug, forgive me.
What is wrong with Ivar?
Everybody talks, but nobody knows.
Aslaug: He is my son.
Siggy: But sooner or later,
you have to show him to the world.
You can't keep him covered up forever.
Ragnar is right.
Aslaug, this child will never walk.
Oh, by the gods, you must...
You must put him out to die.
Thank you for your good advice,
but I would rather die myself than take it.
King Ecbert:
Kwenthrith: Ecbert... What is it? Ecbert?
I'm done.
Kwenthrith: What? Already?
- King Ecbert: We've been-
- Kwenthrith: Well, I'm not done.
King Ecbert: Well, I don't know
how I can be of help.
Kwenthrith: What about the priest!
King Ecbert: Athelstan?
Kwenthrith: Yes, he lived with the
pagans and pagans like sex, don't they?
King Ecbert: Athelstan is a...
He's a spiritual man.
Kwenthrith:
Well, I've never met a spiritual man
who doesn't like to make love
like an animal.
Don't... Don't... Don't you want to sleep?
Are you insane?
Where are you going?
King Ecbert: I am going somewhere
to sleep.
In the meantime,
I will send in some of my warriors
to attend your needs.
Good night, princess.
King Ecbert: Good luck.
Warrior: This way.
Kwenthrith: Don't be shy.
Old warrior: There!
Now we will win!
Our child should have a name,
now that the gods have saved him.
His name is Ivar.
Ivar, the Boneless!
Warrior: Goodbye, my love!
Bjorn: Porunn!
Porunn!
Porunn!
Porunn!
I should not talk to you.
Many do not wish it.
In any case, what does it matter?
I'll probably die in battle.
Porunn: I love you.
Floki: I'm crazy and cracked.
There is something wrong with me,
which is why I choose
to travel with King Horik.
Helga: Why?
Floki: I don't know yet.
There's something about him.
He understands the gods better than Ragnar.
- Helga: No.
- Floki: No?
Helga: That is not possible.
Floki: I mean the real
gods, the darker gods,
the gods that haunt me.
Siggy: Rollo.
I will be here when you return,
if it is what you want.
Warrior: All sail!
Man: Pull off! Pull off!
Captain: Let's go!
Ragnar: Thank you.
Torstein: What is the matter with you?
Something the seer told me.
What did the seer tell you?
That Athelstan is alive.
Athelstan? But I thought he was dead.
That's what King Horik led me to believe.
He also said that Athelstan betrayed him.
King Horik: How is Ragnar
treating you these days?
He treats me well enough.
It is my judgment that a boat builder...
Is worth ten earls.
And how many kings?
If you decide to build boats for me,
I would certainly treat you like a king.
You think you can buy me with riches?
I would never insult you like that.
What I need from you,
Floki, are your ideas...
For they are worth more
than gold and silver,
and they come from the gods.
Are you sure they do?
Ah, yes... Yes, I'm sure.
Rollo: What are you thinking?
I am thinking about battle.
Rollo: You have nothing to be fearful of.
I will always be by your side.
Erlendur: Land!
Warrior:
- Warrior 1: Land!
- Warrior 2: Come on!
King Horik:
King Ecbert: Your friends have returned.
Athelstan: My friends?
King Ecbert: A large fleet of northmen
have come ashore in Wessex.
One of the ships, I am told,
was flying the black raven
banner of Ragnar Lothbrok.
What will you do?
I hope I can negotiate with Ragnar.
When we met before,
he struck me as different.
Intelligent.
He will listen to reason.
Good.
But if not, I will fight him.
I have already sent a
message to King Aelle,
asking him to supply warriors,
according to our treaty.
Whatever happens, I will not be defeated.
Shield-maiden 1: It's secure.
Shield-maiden 2: Here, I'll help you.
- Warrior 1: Here they are.
- Warrior 2: Where is he?
Warrior: Now, have a drop of this.
Shield-maiden: The fires going
out. Inge, help me!
Shield-maiden: Cover this here!
Warrior: And dig a trench for it.
Shield-maiden: Tie it with this rope.
I never imagined the west would be so wet!
King Horik: Where is Torstein going?
I sent him to inform the
king of our return.
Why?
Ragnar: So he knows that
we are here to talk...
And not to fight.
And you did that without
consulting with me.
Ragnar: I thought you would both agree.
King Horik: Why should you think that?
Ragnar: Because it is a sensible policy.
Fine, I will...
Unfortunately, it is too
late to recall Torstein.
Lagertha: You should have
discussed it with us;
King Horik is right.
Ragnar: I will try to remember that
the next time, Earl Ingstad.
King Horik: There is not going to be
a next time, Ragnar,
unless you agree you will
never ever do anything again
without consulting with me first.
For you and I are not equals.
So, what do you propose now?
Ragnar: Wait.
Lagertha: For what?
Ragnar: The unexpected.
King Horik: Let me tell you
what to expect, hmm?
King Ecbert will send
some envoy to trick us,
or he will send some army to annihilate us.
That went well.
Warrior: They're coming!
The Saxons are coming!
Rollo: Form a shield wall!
Shield wall!
Warrior: Hold them! They're escaping!
- Rollo: Narrow their approach!
- Warrior: Over there! Over there!
Ragnar Lothbrok,
my father, King Ecbert,
sends his greetings.
He hopes that you will be
prepared to talk to him.
Ragnar: I am prepared.
But we would have to exchange hostages.
Aethelwulf: Of course.
And my father also sends you this,
as a token of his good will.
Ragnar: This is Athelstan's.
I gave it to him.
Then he is alive.
Aethelwulf: Athelstan is waiting to
see you at my father's villa.
You have his guarantee of safe passage,
as well as my father's.
Ragnar: Then...
We will all come to your father's villa.
Anglo-Saxon soldiers: Ho! Hyah! Hyah!
Captain: Halt! Halt!
- Warrior: Aggghhhhhhh!
- Aethelwulf: Agghhh! Ungh!
Agghhh!
Unnggghhhh!
