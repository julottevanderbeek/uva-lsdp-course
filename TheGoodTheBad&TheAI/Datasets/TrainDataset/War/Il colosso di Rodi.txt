Let's go. Hurry.
Come. This way. Hurry.
Sound the alarm.
Extraordinary spectacle, uncle.
Fit for an Oriental court.
Amuse you, Dario?
Spectacles always amuse me.
You like my island of Rhodes?
Even more than your native Greece?
After the fatigue of war, l knew you'd like
a short stay on the island of peace.
And this perfume. What is it, uncle?
Roses, my son.
Rhodes is also the island of flowers.
'
And beautiful women
from what l can see.
ln Rhodes, even the women
have a special fragrance.
A mixture made out of sunshine...
...petals of flowers, the sea--
And flesh.
At my age,
that's a superfluous ingredient, Dario.
You have designed and built...
...one of the greatest monuments
of all time, Carete.
You, Carete, have made it possible
for posterity to learn of the strength...
...and power of King Serse.
Rhodes now dominates the seas.
Perhaps our ceremony is not to the liking
of the gods.
The monument surely seems to be a threat
to their omnipotence.
l assure you both, it's not true.
l know the gods could only be delighted
that a monument so imposing...
...was built in their honor.
lt is a proud day
for the king of Rhodes.
For you, Apollo, god of the sun...
...we humbly dedicate
this magnificent statue...
...conceived and born
from the divine mind of our king...
...and gloriously realized
by the quiet labor of his loyal subjects.
May the sacred fire burn always
on this altar in the sky...
...and guide those who sail in the night.
And may it strike terror and awe...
...in the hearts of those
who would plot against Rhodes.
Burn, oh, fire.
May your flame be as eternal
as the glory of King Serse.
Very relaxing, your island of peace.
lf only he had talked to us about it.
What could he have hoped to do
all alone?
Poor Rianos.
What a great waste.
No, Mirte.
Our fight is more important now
because of Rianos.
The people in Rhodes do not want slavery.
This Colossus was erected in blood.
They worked and labored on it
for 10 years...
...because of the whim of a ruler.
Our brother hoped he could
inspire a rebellion.
That's not enough.
Our people need supplies and arms.
Not only inspiration.
The Greeks. They'd help us.
They'd be happy to aid our cause.
They don't even know our cause exists.
There's no help from them.
lf only we could talk to someone
who might persuade the Greeks to aid us...
...a man the Greeks respect,
a man like that visitor, Dario.
He's a great warrior in Greece.
l wonder if we dare approach him?
Brothers, if you like, l will go to Dario.
No, Mathos.
We could not appear at court.
All four of us are too well known
as opponents of the regime.
l'm sorry, Mathos.
Always fiddling with toys.
This might not be a toy at all.
Thar...
...the splendor of our court is pleasing,
don't you think...
...to the ambassador of Phoenicia?
He seems to be enjoying it.
However, sire, your great wealth
could propagate ill will, envy.
And you envy me?
l only admire.
My profound loyalty to you only permits me
one emotion, that of great admiration.
There's no doubt that you people know
how to amuse yourselves.
l think my mother was right when she said
this island was a wonderful place.
Your mother knows Rhodes?
She was born here, Diala.
lt's surprising when a stranger
admires the island as you do.
Oh, l'm only half a stranger.
l already know quite a few people here.
Take that man over there, for instance.
He's been staring at me
ever since the celebration began.
There's so little opportunity
to stare at great heroes here.
Nectar of the Euphrates.
An offering
from your humble palace servant.
l think you ought to reward these people.
Let us allow him the first drink
in gratitude for such devotion.
My boy...
...you drink it.
Drink or you'll be beheaded.
Somehow l've lost my desire for wine.
No need to do without wine, Dario.
Just never be the first one to drink.
Have the assassin taken away.
You seem to know Rhodes well.
Tell me something.
Is this a celebration or a massacre?
lt's not our affair. l'm not concerned.
Well.
l think we ought to watch out.
You must be used to death.
The second in one day
is too many in time of peace, l think.
l want to forget it.
Shall we go outside?
Noble sir...
...when may l speak to you?
l'm quite busy, right now.
Tomorrow, if you wish.
lt's beautiful.
A marvelous garden.
Of course, the enchantment of nature...
...is always enhanced
by the presence of a lovely lady.
Now you sound like a poet.
l shall have to be quite careful.
No more so than you are now.
You avoid my eye.
There.
What, you mean you haven't already
succumbed to my look?
Do all girls find you so irresistible?
Not all of them, but some of them
l commit the same error.
What?
Well, with some...
...l waste too much time.
Diala.
Diala?
Diala.
The whole dynasty is here.
Diala?
Dario.
''Emone.''
''Cleo.''
''Nestore.''
''Gerione.''
No name here.
''Artidorous.''
-''Filomena--''
-Dario.
Pardon me. Was that you?
Have you forgotten me already?
Well, l followed you here.
Isn't that enough?
Perhaps you need more
proof of my ardor.
Why did you bring me here?
To be alone with you. To speak.
l command you
to say something beautiful.
Being so close to you,
l've lost my voice...
...even my breath.
Then you shouldn't stay here.
Your cheek...
...is fresh as the morning dew.
Your ear, a flower about to bud.
And my lips?
Your lips--
Diala.
l'm sure you'll find
some good company in there.
Good company indeed.
The proposal as it is offered
does appeal to me.
As the ambassador states, Rhodes
and Phoenicia would control the sea.
But will not Greece protest an alliance
between us and their enemy, Phoenicia?
Yes, naturally.
And we have always been a friend
to Greece.
l think l should consider Rhodes
before l think of Greece.
The Colossus in our harbor makes us
the strongest port in the Mediterranean...
...for the reason that it provides
an impregnable harbor...
...for our ships
and the ships of our friends...
...beginning naturally with Phoenicia.
lmagine the surprise of the Greeks...
...when their ships are plundered
by the Phoenicians...
...who then take refuge in Rhodes.
What makes you think
the Greeks don't already suspect us?
Please.
l was hoping this doorway
would reveal the secrets of this labyrinth.
Can you explain how you got into it,
Dario?
Got in? Well, more exactly, l fell in.
l was standing, leaning against the wall.
Suddenly, the wall turned around.
And there l was
on the other side of the wall.
Well, that is, l was on this side.
l was chasing a girl.
l pray your pursuit be continued, Dario.
Thank you. Thank you.
l hope you'll accept my--
My apologies.
Thar, do you think that young Greek
meant to spy on us?
lt's likely.
However, no need to be alarmed.
l have foreseen something like this.
So much tension on Rhodes...
...l thought it wise to order that no one
be allowed to leave the island.
Especially a soldier of Greece.
-Now, shall we proceed?
-Yes, by all means. Proceed.
Your island from this point
on to the other side is impregnable.
The only spot accessible is your harbor.
Our Phoenician ships, loaded
with Greek booty, will take refuge there.
The Colossus pours out molten lead
on those who might pursue us here.
Your island, in its enviable position
in the middle of the sea...
...is more precious than gold.
We Phoenicians are happy
to split the booty in half.
Do you mean that?
Good counsel, Xenon.
ln order to accept,
l must make this one condition.
The port is open to no more than
three Phoenician ships at one time.
And no more than 200 men are to enter.
We would not want
the Mediterranean powers...
...to misinterpret
the intentions of this pact.
They must not think we are ruled
by Phoenicia.
l accept.
May this project benefit both you...
...and my king.
Thiel.
-Well, did you speak to Dario?
-No.
He was too concerned with a woman
tonight.
l'll try again.
-l'll try again in the morning.
-No.
We must see him tonight.
We'll get to him somehow, Thiel.
Now you must go.
You've risked enough already.
But--
Go. Hurry.
Carete and his daughter are Greeks,
aren't they?
No. He and Diala are from Lydia.
l thought only a Greek mind could have
created such a beautiful work of art.
Oh, you mean the Colossus?
These awful storms.
l've lived on this island all my life.
You'd think l would have
got used to them by now.
Are you afraid of thunder?
My dear nephew, you don't know
what a storm on this island can mean.
lt can bring havoc
from one moment to the next.
Here or at the center of the sea.
Rhodes is at the mercy of the elements,
my boy.
l've always found the best remedy
for thunder is to sleep.
l suppose you're right.
Well, thanks to my architect,
my room is better protected than most.
Up you go.
Blasted thunder.
As you say, sleep is indeed the remedy.
However, there are times
when sleep must be helped along.
Now the end of the world could come
and l wouldn't even hear it.
l imagine soldiering is not a simple job,
especially when you play the hero all day.
l don't play the hero.
ln fact, talking about this thunder...
...l owe a debt of gratitude to lightning.
lt was at the battle of Ipsies
where l surprised Calemathos.
Just because he'd been stunned by
a bolt of lightning that had struck nearby.
l shall never forget the look on his face
when, with one arm, l squeezed his-- Oh.
All right, let's go. Right now.
Who are you? What do you want?
We must speak to you.
It's extremely important.
Well, talk then.
No, not here.
-We have no wish to harm you, Dario.
-Come with us. You have no choice.
Come on.
We never meant to fight you,
but you forced us to fight.
lt looks like we'll have to carry him
back with us.
quickly, there's no time to lose.
Someone must have seen us.
Now, let's go.
Come.
Dario.
Dario.
Dario.
What happened?
So Rhodes is the island of peace?
Well, l prefer war.
Excuse me. Who are they?
They're Macedonian slaves,
furnished to us by the Phoenicians.
King Serse probably needs
the poor devils as laborers...
...to build more monuments to his pride.
That him?
l'm looking for passage to Athens.
Under orders of the king,
no one may sail from Rhodes.
But l have to get back home.
No sailings are allowed
unless properly authorized.
What if one were willing to pay
double the price?
l don't think you heard me.
No one sails.
Thank you.
-Let's go.
-You stay here.
-No, l should go.
-l must approach Dario alone.
A woman averts suspicion.
Gather around, my dear friends of Rhodes.
You are bidden to stop.
l have in my possession
the most excellent gift...
...the rarest of jewels.
The sacred birds
from the temples of Persia.
Bird, you see, now is as precious,
my friends, as a pearl or a ruby.
lt has a beak
that is as hard as the best iron.
Yet it is gentle as a lamb,
faithful as a dog.
Since your humble servant has already
trained these magnificent birds for you...
...they will act as guardians in your home.
Evil spirits, nay, even might....
Are you looking for someone?
l see l wasn't too subtle.
Well, in fact l was following you.
Now what should we do?
l can grant your most secret desire.
Which one?
l know you wish
to arrange passage from Rhodes.
l saw you at the pier
attempting to obtain this passage.
l know men who own a good vessel.
And the price?
Taking a small risk. You'll go?
l'd rather not risk if possible.
l can get help through the court.
l'm a stranger here.
Let us hope.
If you find you're wasting your time...
...go to the pier and look for a torch.
A man will be there as your guide.
Good day.
-And good luck.
-One moment.
Now l must go.
lf you succeed in developing
this new weapon of yours...
...we shall be invincible.
No one is ever that.
Our ancestors with their stone axes
also believed they were invincible.
We are nothing but sand.
A good sized wave
can still threaten to destroy us.
Our footprints are temporary.
The Colossus will stand.
Your genius will too.
Somehow l feel l've created nothing.
-How--
-Rhodes is certainly proud.
Especially Diala.
She's proud to call herself your daughter.
She's proud.
l'm sure.
Proud of the money and honor she enjoys
as a result of my inventions.
What are you saying?
When her mother had died...
...l brought her to my house
and took care of her as if she were mine.
l tried to the best of my ability...
...but l know l won't succeed...
...even though you think
l can accomplish anything...
...in producing blood ties
that do not exist.
Dario, l pray your youth and good spirits
can dispel Carete's depression.
A little while ago, l was prevented
from leaving Rhodes. Why?
Well, l only thought l should further extend
our hospitality to you.
Hospitality is not a prison.
At this time, it's impossible
to grant you a permit to leave.
You shall have to stay in Rhodes.
Very well.
l'll do it my own way.
Dario.
The conquering hero
honors us with a visit.
The visit is over.
And so is my interest in Rhodes.
ls it that your visit...
...was too dull for you?
l bore you?
On the contrary.
My visit was brief but exciting.
lt's awful that l love to play jokes on men.
l beg you to forgive it.
You don't think l'm leaving Rhodes
because you forced me...
...to explore the underground passages
of the palace, do you?
No.
lt's just that l'm anxious
to breathe the air of my own country.
But--
But you can't leave the island.
So they say.
l have been waiting a long time for you.
Follow me.
This is the ship. Go down.
Welcome. Welcome aboard my ship.
Thank you. When do we sail?
Just as soon as l assemble my men,
l'll cast off.
Who's there?
Who are you?
Just a woman. Don't be afraid.
lt must get lonesome here.
Who are you looking for?
A guard...
...to keep me company tonight.
Just a moment.
Send them the signal. Not too loud.
-There it is, the second one.
-Row.
Let's hope their soldiers sleep well.
-You've spoken to Dario?
-No.
When we get out to sea,
l'll speak to him then.
Slow.
Pull in the oars.
quickly.
Over the side.
Jump, men. In you go.
Jump in. Now.
Now l know why you were in a hurry
to sail back to your homeland.
This document.
You wanted to deliver this document.
-What is it?
-Don't tell me you've forgotten.
lt's useless, Dario, to go on pretending.
Our enemies in Rhodes...
...a small and vicious band
bent on opposing the government...
...are looking for foreign aid
to bolster their cause.
They hired you
to bring these lies to Greece.
They'd like the Greeks to help them
unleash a civil war on the island of Rhodes.
This treason shall not go unpunished.
l don't know what you're talking about.
l was only trying to get back to Athens.
The most astonishing slanders
appear in this document, Dario.
lt seems we're totally corrupt.
We're criminals.
lt also states that we're plotting
against Greece with Phoenicia.
What's more, you, Dario...
...are specifically named
as their representative.
l hardly need more proof
of your treachery.
And l tell you, l had nothing to do
with this whole affair.
You know, your own accomplices
may not agree with you.
You recognize your friends?
You know who they are?
The sailors from the boat.
l think you could be a bit more specific.
Tell me you don't know who this is.
Surely you recognize him.
l don't know him.
He also, in his way, is a man of a nobility.
Peliocles.
Eldest brother of a family which dares
pretend to the throne of Rhodes.
This man is the leader of traitors.
And it's apparent
that you have joined his ranks.
The Athenian is innocent.
He has never seen any of us before.
He knows nothing.
l want to know only one thing.
You'll tell me gladly
before l'm through with you.
Tell me where
the rest of your men are hiding.
You'll learn nothing.
The bell.
'
These vibrations, if continued
would shatter his eardrums.
However, l don't want him deaf just yet.
Pull it up.
Arouse him, guard.
l command you to talk.
-l'll get him to talk.
-No, it's a waste of time...
...to try to get anything
out of these jackals.
See that they're all kept in chains,
while l go and prepare for their execution.
Come ashore.
All right. Move.
Move.
Another boatload of slaves.
Serse must have great plans for Rhodes.
Something strange here.
Even Serse could not find use
for so many slaves.
-You go back.
-You're planning to stay here?
l'm going to follow those slaves.
Perhaps they'll be in whatever prison...
-...they're holding our brothers.
-That's not likely.
We've tried everything else.
l've got to go.
l might even find Dario.
Just try to find our brothers, Mathos.
All rise.
Warm greetings, Sirione.
l hoped you would lead our soldiers
from Phoenicia.
Sirione will take his orders from you.
He is the bravest of our Phoenician officers.
An actor as well
the way he winced under m' y whip...
...as if the pain were unbearable.
The pain was certainly real enough,
Mahor.
You must admit you were whipping me
with all the strength you had.
Noble sire, l would deem it
the greatest of honors...
...if you would order me
to kill King Serse myself.
Your enthusiasm is commendable, Sirione.
However, we must all be patient.
With your help, the throne of Rhodes
will soon be mine.
Let Serse take comfort while he can
in the impregnability of his island.
Well, the conquerors of his Colossus
have arrived masquerading as slaves.
Only when the deed is done
will it be the time to rejoice.
Here are your initial orders.
You will repair to your quarters
beneath this temple until it is time to strike.
l shall instruct Sirione
as to all military details...
...and after Serse's downfall...
...you shall know
the extent of my gratitude.
Follow me.
Thiel.
-Something new?
-Your brothers and all captured rebels...
...are going to be sacrificed to Baal
this very day.
Follow me.
Dario.
Guards, you wait here.
l managed to talk with the king.
lt's up to you now to save your life.
What would l have to do?
Tell them
where the rest of the rebels are.
Tell them everything you know.
l know nothing.
l told Thar that.
And l have something else to say.
Even if l did know, l wouldn't speak.
But why?
By now you must have realized
they're common bandits.
Why die for them?
l think it's pretty obvious
who the bandits are.
But you--
You could go free.
Oh, Dario.
l don't want you to die.
Goodbye, Diala.
Guard.
Forward.
Here.
We must get away
before they send reinforcements.
Back to the caves in the Stone Desert.
Come.
-Uncle.
-Yes, l'm in this as deep as you.
Hurry up, Dario. Come.
You're sure you're not mistaken?
Positive. l tell you,
l saw hundreds of Phoenicians.
The underground temple was full of them.
Thar obviously is behind this.
He is no longer content with the power
Serse stupidly bestowed upon him.
He wants this beautiful island
to sell to Phoenicia...
...then he'll be the reigning monarch.
We can't let that happen.
Surely there's something we can do.
We don't have enough men
to attack them openly.
Do you have a plan?
Yes, l have.
To look for a way to enter the Colossus.
But the Colossus is impregnable.
How could we hope to get in?
This is now a fight for survival, men.
Rhodes' best soldiers
are imprisoned underground.
A heavy gate seals the only exit.
This gate can only be opened by a control
in the Colossus. You told me about it.
That's right.
l was working in a group that built it.
To make sure
that the installation was kept secret...
...those who worked on it
were thrown into the fire...
...so they would not be able
to talk about it. But l got away.
So the control is there.
lf we're lucky, we'll locate it and,
what's more important, open the gate.
Once we release the prisoners,
they can help us to attack Thar.
Do you approve?
Six of us should be able to do it.
Let's say tomorrow.
l want each man to pick one.
That's suicide.
Colossus is a huge trap.
Every detail has been studied for years
to make it impregnable.
How can you hope to break into it
with a handful of men?
Do you have a better suggestion?
We must try this or it will be all over.
All of us here feel the same.
And we all understand
the greatness of the risk.
Without any hope of coming out alive?
We'll see.
To bring peace to our people...
...is worth more than the lives of six men.
l was sure you'd left Rhodes.
You shouldn't be here.
Don't you have the sense
to realize you're in danger?
Who would look for me here
at this time of night?
You certainly don't seem to lack courage.
You'll have to explain.
What is it?
You act so foolishly
just out of a desire to see me?
Diala...
...l must see your father.
lt's very important.
lmportant?
What is it, Dario?
To save Rhodes.
Thar is a traitor.
He's hidden a small army
of Phoenician soldiers in the temple of Baal.
lmpossible. You must be wrong.
How could the Phoenicians
enter the harbor?
Thar is a very shrewd man.
Those Macedonian slaves that arrived here
recently were soldiers in disguise.
But he couldn't.
Unfortunately, it's true.
We can still be in time to stop him.
What do you want with Father?
The poor man couldn't be of any help.
Your father is the only one
who knows the secrets of the Colossus.
With his help,
we can turn the tide against Thar.
Father's been spending nights at the
Colossus, working on some new invention.
Well...
...can you get word to him?
l must speak to him.
Don't worry, l'll bring you to see Father.
Without me, you'd probably get caught.
So we'll go together.
That might be dangerous for you.
l thought you said
this was to save Rhodes.
Dario, everything will be all right.
You will leave me
if anything goes wrong?
The only thing l ask of you is...
...in case of danger...
...warn Peliocles.
You'll find him
in the caves of the Stone Desert.
l will. Now, you go.
l'll come back.
Dario.
Dario, l....
Here is the first control room.
Amazing.
What is all this complicated machinery
used for?
ln a word, for the protection of Rhodes.
Stop.
You mustn't touch this.
It controls the door to the prisons.
Your little visit is quite a surprise,
Athenian...
...but l'm delighted you came. Watch out.
He eluded us. He jumped into the water.
You fools.
Why does this Athenian
outwit all our men?
You are right to be angry, Diala.
But...
...the day has not been unprofitable
after all.
The Athenian will not live long
nor will his newfound friends.
Your bringing him here
was a magnificent idea, Diala.
l'm sure he suspected nothing.
l was afraid
he would get to speak to Father.
Sentimental Father, l know
he would have helped the Athenian.
ln a short time
Rhodes will be in our han'ds, Diala.
There will be no more obstacles
in our way.
No, there is still one obstacle left.
Yes, this deluded old man labored...
...so that it might benefit all humanity.
l thought l was working...
...for the freedom of the people
not their enslavement.
But you're planning to betray Rhodes.
And l thank the gods
l have found out in time to stop you.
Diala.
Diala.
'
It was inevitable. Now, with his death
Rhodes is ours to conquer.
Mirte.
You must be so proud
of what you've done to us.
They were very efficient.
What do you mean?
Thanks to your information...
...Thar's soldiers were able to take us
by surprise and completely wipe us out.
They took Peliocles
and your uncle Lissipo.
They took all our best soldiers.
They'll hold the execution tonight
so you can watch my brothers killed.
-But you don't think l--
-We don't think. We know.
You were the traitor.
You told Thar precisely
where our camp was.
Mirte saw you in Rhodes last night
at Diala's.
But now we'll play your way.
Mathos.
Everything is ready, sire.
Come, Mirte.
People of Rhodes.
People of Rhodes.
A terrible danger hangs over your homes
and all your children.
A group of traitors has delivered the island
to a foreign power.
Hundreds and hundreds of Phoenician
soldiers are in the city...
...awaiting the order to attack.
l forbid you to go on, Athenian.
l forbid you.
Be careful, Serse.
The treason was prepared
in your own palace.
The Colossus you built
is now a nest for the traitors...
...and they're waiting
to overthrow the throne...
...to enrich themselves
with the treasures of Rhodes...
...and impose a reign of terror.
May the gods mete out to you
a horrible death for--
Over there.
Stop. Stop.
What are you going to do without arms?
You'll all be killed.
-But the people are with us.
-We need trained men.
There's a thousand of our men
under the Colossus in the prison cave.
lf we free them, we still have a chance.
-Peliocles.
-Mirte.
You're all all right?
But how do we open this gate?
This way.
-Mathos.
-Peliocles.
There's no time to lose.
To the Colossus, everyone.
You've done more than your share, Dario.
Now you'd better think of safety.
Safety? There is no safety.
l'm sure you don't know where
the secret entrance is in the Colossus.
And you don't know
where to open the gates to the prison.
Wait. We will approach
the prison caves by sea.
Dario will get to the control in the Colossus
that opens the prison gates.
May l go with you?
The signal.
The signal.
Send them the reply immediately.
Thar's plan has worked.
King Serse is dead.
Splendid.
The Colossus is in our hands.
Thar is about to assume
the throne of Rhodes.
And right now on the seas,
our proud Phoenician fleet...
...rapidly approaches to support his reign.
According to my information...
...the sails of the first ships
will appear on the horizon at dawn.
Thar, a masterful strategist,
has prepared it all.
My mission is almost over.
May l congratulate you,
future queen of Rhodes?
Up.
Guards, come with me.
Two of you, follow me.
The rest of you guard the entrance.
Guards, form ranks.
This opens the door of the prison.
Let's go.
Dario, look out.
Get out, men. Get out.
Hurry. Get out of there, men.
Don't move, Athenian.
Kill him.
No.
Why wait, Diala?
lt'd be too easy for him.
And later, we'll have more time.
Good.
With this, we'll get into the Colossus
and turn it against our enemies.
What happened to Mathos and Dario?
Forward.
Hurry.
Tie him up.
lt seems your rebel friends
wish to visit us.
l shall greet them very warmly.
Load the catapults.
Faster.
A few more times should do it.
'
Athenian, that is molten lead
for your information.
Let go.
Over there. Everyone take cover.
Again.
Peliocles, Mathos and Dario
are up there alone.
-We must get them out.
-No, no, no. That would be suicide.
Half of our men
have been wounded already.
We'll think of something else. Come.
Your companions are inordinate cowards.
They're all running away in terror.
Take the injured and carry them inside.
Peliocles, we've got to go back
and try and stop those cursed catapults.
No. We're staying right here.
All we can do is wait for them
to come out.
And put our hope...
...in Mathos and Dario.
