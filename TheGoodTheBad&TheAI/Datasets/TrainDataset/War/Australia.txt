Coppers.

-
- Whoa there. Whoa. Whoa.
-
My husband must sell Faraway Downs.
is only one-sixth
of what it was once worth.
We need the money, Ramsden.
But Maitland
is just about to muster the fats.
What?
Get the-the big cows ready for market.
there is only one reason my husband
has spent so much time down under...
and it has absolutely nothing
to do with cows.
At least not of the animal variety.
Lady Ashley,
I-I do think that's a bit harsh.
- Oh, Ramsden, drink your tea.
- Lady Ashley!
I intend to travel
to this cattle station...
sell it...
and bring Maitland home myself!
-
-
The Drover?
Any of you other Carney boys
want to have a go?
Come on, fellas.
Don't let fear stand in your way.
I'll have ya.
-
- Hey! No boongs in here!
- He's not in the pub, Ivan.
-
-
-
You work with them,
you eat with them...
and you sleep with them.
Oh, crikey.
When you see her, wave your hat.
What are you waiting for, an invitation?
I hate coming to town.
Lady Sarah Ashley.
A genuine aristocrat
living right here in Darwin.
Administrator, we're at war.
Oh.
-
-
- She's quite a looker.
-
what Lady Sarah Ashley...
claims he's mustering fats
at Faraway Downs.
-
- Faraway Downs.
The only cattle station
in the whole of the north...
not owned by Leslie "King" Carney.
- Lord Maitland Ashley
is mustering on Faraway Downs?
- Isn't quite what we had in mind, is it, Neil?
-
And now his missus has arrived
on the flying boat.
Ah, she won't last.
A delicate English rose withers
in the outback. Hmm.
You with me?
If you must know, I am to be met-
by my husband's trusted man,
a Mr. Drover.
The bloody Drover?
Bring it. Yes.
Move it.
Look at my wife and daughter down there
giving her the royal welcome.
My fiancé, Neil Fletcher,
manages Faraway Downs.
Good day.
A bit pale.
Not a bad-looking sheila,
but what's the story on the luggage?
Wants to settle down
in the outback, does she?
jeopardizes the supply of
to our troops.
But it's a poor war that doesn't make
a decent patriot rich, so...
to set a hoof on that wharf.
- You with me, Neil?
- Yeah, yeah. Nature will take its course.
No, I've arranged for someone special
to give her the old scenic route.
Give her a taste of the outback.
-
- No!
-
- The Drover.
The Drover?
I'm Sarah Ashley.
-
- My husband, Lord Ashley...
has sent a trusted man to collect me.
It seems as if he has been waylaid.
No women.
Ladies' lounge next door.
No wonder your establishment is empty.
Good day.
Oh! Oh!
You can take him!
-
-
No!
Oh! No, no!
Welcome to Australia.
- Oh!
-
Water.
Oh.
That's it. That's it. Stay, Jedda. Stay.
"Trusted man."
Typical of my husband.
Actually, your husband's
a pretty good bloke.
Yes, well, he certainly knows
how to choose his employees.
- Employee?
- Mmm. No wonder the place is bankrupt.
- Lady, I'm not an employee.
-
So you're just driving me
all the way out to Faraway Downs...
- as a personal favor to my husband, are you?
- No.
Him being
such a good bloke and all, hmm?
I'm driving you out there because he
promised me a drove of 1,500 head of cattle.
- What, to buy?
- No, you goose. To drove.
I'm a drover, right? I move
the cattle from "A" to "B."
- Oh-
- Everything I own...
I can fit in my saddlebag,
which is the way I like it.
Oh! Yes, well, it's all-
all very "outback adventure," isn't it?
- I'm not saying it's for everyone.
- No.
Definitely not for everyone.
Most people like to own things.
You know, land, luggage, other people.
And in the end, the only thing
you really own is, uh-
is your story.
Just tryin' to live a good one.
Yes, yes. An adventure story.
Mmm. You sound just like my husband.
Oh!
Oh, they're kangaroos!
-
- Oh! Lovely.
-
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Beautiful.
-
- Oh!
Oh, it's beautiful.
-
- Oh! Look at them jumping!
-
-
Ah!
Mr. Drover.
Hey, Miss Boss.
Tucker, Mrs. Boss?
- Mr. Drover.
- Yeah?
- There's only one tent.
- That's right.
For the four of us?
Well, you know, it gets
pretty chilly here at night.
We, uh-We like to bunk up together,
eh, Magarri? Goolaj, huh?
Nice and close, you know.
Oh!
Oh, come on, Lady Ashley.
We're just having a laugh.
Never really slept in a tent in our life.
We just bunk around the fire, you see?
- See, we're not really used to, um-
- A woman?
Well, I will have you know
that I am as capable as any man.
Guests. We're not used to guests.
That's what I was about to say.
But now you mention it, I happen to
quite like the women of the outback.
But they're mostly native women.
Aboriginal women.
to get along with, if you try.
something is bothering me #
Go!
-
- Him always punctual.
-
- Get out of here!
-
- Your accountant.
-
-
Kippelly Flymm.
- Kippelly Flynn.
- I'm sorry. What was your name again?
Lipelling Klymm, mi- mila- milady.
Kipling Flynn.
Thanks.
- Drover! Hey, Drover!
-
Nah, gotta make a delivery.
Put the kettle on.
- I'll be round in a couple days. Give us a kiss.
- Okay.
See you soon.
- She's easy to get on with.
- Ah, she's trouble, that one.
- See you later!
-
You and my husband
share an interest.
An interest? Really?
Come on. We all know the real reason
that my husband is out here.
Oh. Right.
You mean the breeding. Yeah.
-  Breeding?
-
No, we're both dead keen on breeding.
I have this idea,
which, uh-which he loves.
You might be quite excited
about it too, actually.
Now, I'm a brumby man,
but his fancy English filly, Capricornia...
I got to admit.
She is gorgeous. Really gorgeous.
Gorgeous creature.
-
- Don't. Don't you say another word.
- I know what you're implying.
- You've thought about it, too, haven't you?
Capricornia-You- Poppycock!
- What are you talking about?
- Poppycock!
Coppers.
- What are you talking about?
- You-You want-
- You want to have it on with me.
- What? What was that?
Oh, you know exactly what I'm saying.
and-and-and God knows how many others.
What are you talking about?
- You got a filthy mind, lady.
- You're an animal!
I wouldn't have it on with you
if you were the only tart left in Australia.
- Animal! You are a-
- Believe me, I wouldn't-
Oh!
- Stay in the car.
- No, no.
Get your hands off me.
For once in your life,
do as you're bloody told.
-
-
Faraway Downs.
-
- Oh! Oh!
Lady Ashley, wait! Don't go in there!
-
-
I'm so sorry.
the owners of Faraway Downs
for three generations.
he never gave up.
The only thing that could stop this decent
and courageous man was a spear...
Lady Ashley, we can leave for Darwin
first thing in the morning.
Yes, yes. Certainly, Mr. Fletcher.
Watch the, um-
I can't understand what my husband
would have seen out here.
Yeah, this land has a strange power.
##
-
-
##
##
-
- I let you see me now.
Who are you?
I Nullah.
How did you get in here?
I make myself invisible...
with  magic!
##
What do you want?
That  Fletcher
been curse to this place.
You
Like I sing a fish to me.
##
when Mama and Fletcher...
make wrong-side business.
Wrong-sided business?
You know.
Laying down and tickling.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Me and you secret.
Oh, my goodness. Mr. Fletcher?
I got to sing to Mama to warn her...
that Lord Boss Ashley is coming down.
Maitland? I- I-
Yeah. He plenty funny.
So that's why I took him down the billabong,
shown him all the big, fat, cheeky bulls.
Come here. Look'em. Look.
Get pushed across that river...
over to Carney land.
The bulls.
-
-
Please don't.
Don't make'em that policeman
take away my boy.
Them coppers. That bad Fletcher.
He say you see me,
you send me to the Mission Island.
To that lock-lock.
Throw away bloody key.
Please, missus! Quick!
I make us invisible.
-
-
- Mrs. Boss.
- Oh! Oh. It's you.
- Last night, I show you-
-
Hyah!
- where-
-
Yeah.
She's a beautiful day, isn't she?
How was your sleep? Restful?
I wouldn't say so, no.
Yeah, now, the boys are-
the boys are just finishing up.
Gotta tell you, they're a pretty sorry mob
of cattle. Seems hardly worth the effort.
Ready to go, Lady Ashley?
Billabong.
Mr. Fletcher...
down at the "billabalong,"
or whatever you call it.
Near the billabong?
No, that's Carney property over there.
Our cattle don't cross the river.
- Apparently they do.
-
Who-Who says they do?
That little boy there.
Hey. Hey, little fella. Come here.
Yeah, come on, Nullah.
-
- They're funny ones.
Now...
did you see big, fat cattle
crossing Marmont River?
- I been lookin' myself.
- Yeah?
Ah, you tell great, big,
tall stories, don't ya, eh?
Sing Song. Take the little fella to the kitchen.
Give him a big feed of that tucker he likes.
-  Forgive me, Mr. Fletcher.
- Look. I understand.
You barely slept.
- Wait, wait.
- Let me go.
Yeah. Well, that old windmill
hasn't turned in years.
He's a sweet little boy.
I don't think he meant any harm.
Yeah, no, they're funny, little creamies.
They're all a bit soft in the head, yeah.
Fletcher liar!
-
- Nullah!
- Fletcher!
-  I curse you!
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!
- Please!
- Run! Run! Run, Nullah! Run!
I curse you!
Leave him alone!
- Leave him alone!
- Mr. Fletcher!
-
-
You no longer work for me.
-
-
There won't be a single bloody beast in the
stockyard to start the drove in the morning.
- Yeah?
-
Now!
You're the boss.
I'll give you a new job somewhere else.
Bunchemup, grab the gear.
Pack it up.
Bloody old fool.
-
-
Carney's gonna get this property.
Been a pleasure working for ya.
Real pleasure.
-
-
Why would Fletcher block the water pump?
I don't know. All crazy.
- White fella, blackfella- all crazy.
- Crazy.
-
-
- Milady.
- Don't get up.
The truth, Mr. Flynn.
This, uh, ledger...
which, um, Fletcher had me keep
for the benefit of your husband...
is a tale of decline and ruin...
redolent of the great Gibbon.
There is, however, another...
kept for the benefit...
- ##
- of Mr. Carney...
fat cattle...
- siphoned off across the river and into his herd.
-
And the boy.
As with all things Fletcher,
it's impossible to prove anything.
Still, if Carney's good Christian wife...
ever comes to the same conclusion
as yourself...
Fletcher's chances of marrying
their daughter would be dashed.
I'm going to the authorities,
and I will be telling them-
- Carney  the authority here.
- Are you suggesting...
I let him steal my cattle and buy my property
for a fraction of what it's worth?
Drove.
Drove the cattle to Darwin.
-
- Would you mind?
-
- I need a drink.
My lady, drove.
Drove the cattle to Darwin,
sell them to the army...
and you'll break Carney's monopoly.
Use the profits to put Faraway Downs
back on its feet.
You go back to London.
You're sitting pretty
for the rest of your life.
That's what Maitland
said he was doing.
And there's no reason
why you can't do the same.
Having dismissed Fletcher,
there's no one to muster the cattle.
Hyah! Hyah!
Drover! Drover!
-
- Hyah!
-
- Hyah!
Yeah, Drover! Yeah!
Teach me how to
break them brumbies!
- See any boys in there?
-
Goolaj, go see if they're
out in the top paddock.
- Mr. Drover!
-
- I'll find out what the hell's going on.
- Teach me to break them horses.
- Fill the water trough, son.
- I need to speak to you!
- That's what I need to speak to you about.
- Where's Fletcher?
- We disagreed, and I dismissed him.
- Dismissed?
- Yes.
- Wa- Hang on. What about the cattle?
Well, it beggars belief,
but as he was leaving...
he deliberately let the cows out of
the, uh- I don't know-whatever you call it...
and they ran off!
Damn! Do you realize, woman,
what you've done?
Mr. Drover, do not take that tone with me.
Thank you very much!
- Don't take that tone with you, huh?
- No.
I'm asking you, woman,
do you know what you've done?
I won't get another drove this late in the season.
You've cost me my living.
- Can't you just round them up?
- Round them up, huh? Oh, round them up. Yeah!
- Yes. You just go get them.
- 1,500 head of cattle-
Oh!
Scattered over a million acres
with just me and my two men.
That's a great idea. Stupid cow.
Mr. Drover,
I was right to dismiss Mr. Fletcher...
on moral grounds.
Moral grounds?
He wanted to, uh, exploit you, did he?
- Fancy you, did he?
- What?
Stop it. I -
Is there any man in this
world who doesn't fancy you?
- Please.
- Huh?
Mr. Fletcher is working for Mr. Carney.
across the river
onto Mr. Carney's property.
They were stealing!
- There's no surprises there.
- No, he's a bad man.
All right, all right.
But look. You can't prove it, right?
- Well-
-
And you can't win against Carney.
So just take my advice, lady.
Grab King Carney's offer and go the hell
back to England as quickly as possible.
That way you'd make everybody happy,
especially me.
So you're just going to walk away?
I learned a long time ago
not to fight other people's wars.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Mr. Drover, wait!
Please, please, please!
Mr. Drover, please! Please! Wait!
- Please. I-
-
Listen. You said that your dream was
to breed a thoroughbred with a-
with a bush brumby.
I will give you my Capricornia.
And how we gonna do a drove
with just me and my two men, huh?
Oh, crikey.
to keep 'em company at night.
That's, uh-What do you call it?
- Exploiting them.
- Exploiting, yes.
Anyway, we're still in trouble.
We gotta have seven good riders at least,
and the most I can count is five.
- What have we got? We've got me-
- You.
- Magarri.
- Yeah, Magarri!
- Goolaj-
- Great.
We got Daisy. Nice ride.
And, uh, Bandy. Good work.
- Hey. Don't look at me.
- Sing Song, me real good cooker.
Cook's wagon at best.
We got five, right? It's not enough.
We need two more experienced riders.
I did that run once back in 1935...
with Magarri, Dingo Jones
and the Drongo brothers-
Drongo brothers.
- true knights of the outback.
- Mr. Flynn. Can you ride?
- I can.
- I won't carry a drunk.
But don't.
I drove those no-good cheeky bulls
into the big, bloody metal ship.
- All right. Five and a quarter.
- Six and a quarter.
Lady, this ain't trotting
in Kensington Gardens.
Pretty sure, when it comes to horses,
there's nothing you can show me.
- Bring the horse.
- You can't be serious.
Bring the horse.
- Oh, this should be interesting.
-
- Move along!
-
Rah! Rah!
- What are you doing?
-
Rah, rah! Rah. Rah! Move it!
- Lady Ashley-
- Move it! Move it! They're going the wrong way.
Rah! Rah!
Oh! It's easy.
Stubborn things. Silly cows.
- Hey, hey, hey. What the bloody hell you doing?
- Come on.
You're scattering them all over the place.
Get up the back there, up the tail.
Get up there. Go, go, go, go, go!
Don't let 'em break away.
Go on.
-
- Run, you cows! Move, you cows!
We're trying to get the cows up there.
- Not too bad, Lady Ashley.
- I've got him! I've got him!
I think we're doing pretty well.
You crazy- take all this stuff.
Where you think you going?
Shanghai?
A lady never knows
what she might need.
Run, Nullah! Run! Run!
-  Coppers! Coppers!
-
Tank, Nullah! Tank!
Hurry up!
Turn 'em loose.
-
- Shh!
Bandy, tea. Tea.
-
-
Lady Ashley, Sergeant Callahan
of the Northern Territory Police.
Grab the float.
I can't begin to tell you,
Lady Ashley, how the...
tragedy which befell
your late husband has...
wrung sympathy from the hearts of every civilized
man and woman in the Northern Territory.
Let me assure you, Lady Ashley...
that the suspect, King George,
will be brought to justice.
But surely a witch doctor could conceal
his own tracks, Sergeant, could he not?
Makes no difference.
It's only a matter of time.
-
- Shh!
Oh, incidentally, I met up with
your former manager, Neil Fletcher.
He informed me that there's a half-blood
Aboriginal child out here somewhere.
I thought we might pick him up
and put him in the good hands of the church.
I will be sure to look out for him.
Till we meet again, Lady Ashley.
-
-
Mama!
Easy. That's it. I got you. I got you.
Come on, Daisy. Come on.
Daisy! Daisy!
Daisy.
##
When someone dies
in the Aboriginal culture...
you're not supposed to
say their name again.
He needs motherin'.
Mothering?
I'm, uh- I'm not, uh, uh-
What?
Good with children.
Oh. Huh.
I wanted to extend my condolences.
Go away.
Would you, uh-
Would you like to hear a story?
What story?
Uh, well, it's, uh- it's called-
- It's called
- What's a wizard?
Well, a wizard is a sort of...
magic man.
Mama say I gulapa.
- I magic man.
- Really?
I wizard man.
We can't say
Mama's name no more.
No. Well-
Uh, anyway, there's a girl...
and there's a dog.
Ruff. Ruff, ruff, ruff!
And there's a tornado-
- Well, no. It's a- In the film, it's a twister.
- Who twister?
Oh, no, no. Twister's not a person.
It's like a big-Whoosh!
- Like a storm.
- Like the wet?
Like the wet.
Anyway,
the story takes place in a, um-
well, a faraway land...
called Oz.
- This good story.
- Oh, well-
- Got song?
- Yes, yes. Lots of songs.
I like song.
You sing'em me,
I learn'em song.
No, no, no. No.
No.
Well, I- Uh, some.
- I'll sing a little.
- Good.
# Somewhere over the, uh-
the rainbow #
- Rainbow Serpent?
- Yes.
That bloody good. Keep going.
You funny singer, but good song.
Oh.
# Somewhere #
##
#There's some birds and they-#
- Uh- Oh-
- Keep going. Come on.
# Someday I'll wish upon a- a star #
#And #
- Come on. Sing more.
- Uh-Yes.
#Wake up where the clouds
are far behind #
# Dreams really do come #
#True ##
##
Oh!
Dreaming song.
we gotta get those no-good, cheeky bulls
into the big, bloody metal ship.
That's right.
That's what dreaming songs
tell us, Mrs. Boss.
We've got to get those
no-good, big, bloody bulls...
into that metal ship.
I'm sorry. I thought he could-
I thought he could do it.
Yeah, well, people don't change,
Miss Ashley.
Twister. Twister!
- No desert comes drier than Kipling Flynn, milady!
- Well done!
Hey!
- Flynn Kipling! Yea!
-
-
-  Hey, hey!
- Welcome! Welcome!
-
- All right.
-
- The appropriate number, huh?
- Yes.
Well, listen up.
I'm only gonna say this once.
I run the show.
Everybody does exactly...
as she's told.
- Understood?
- Understood.
No matter your experience
or your age, you pull your weight.
Yes, boss.
And above all,
the Drover's law: no grog.
-
- Now...
if there's a rush and the cattle
are stampeding towards you...
it's not much good prancing
and dancing about on your show pony.
There's only one thing cattle fear
more than a man on a horse...
and that's a man standing
on his own two feet...
staring 'em right between the eyes.
Now, you sure you mob
are still up for it?
Mm-hmm.
You can count on us.
Oh, crikey.
Well, we're what we are.
Gotta get to Darwin
before the ship sails.
Let's get cracking.
The rest of you jokers follow me.
- Hyah!
- Hyah!
I'll get the gate.
Stay back. Don't let 'em scatter.
There, mate. Push 'em over.
Don't let 'em go down there.
- That's it.
- Get 'em up!
- Whoo!
-
Get up there!
All right.
We'll push 'em straight across here.
Ho!
Very good. Keep 'em movin'.
Nice and steady.

-
- Hyah!
Giddyup! Giddap!
##
of Germany, Italy and Japan...
which threatens to expand World War II
to the shores of Australia.
Couple of days
won't make any difference, Captain.
Might as well sign
the contract now, eh?
I wouldn't be too sure of that,
Mr. Carney.
Air force chaps just spotted a big mob of cattle,
Marmont River?
That's Faraway Downs.
Are you, uh, running cattle
out of Faraway Downs, Mr. Fletcher?
Uh, no, no.
I don't work there anymore.
Well, I suppose Lady Ashley's droving
the cattle herself.
-
- Someone must be helping her.
That's right, Neil.
Someone must be helping her.
You gonna sing'em
them cattle tonight?
No, Nullah. Not me.
I'm the orchestra.
That's why I always carry this-
the famous J. Albert & Son
boomerang harmonica.
Can you play that rainbow song?
Well, I've got the latest 100 songs
of the hit parade here.
not teach me that yet.
Who's
He's my grandfather, King George.
King George... is your grandfather?
Gulapa
teach me
that day down the billabong.
-
-
-
- Mr. Drover, what is that chanting?
Just keeps them calm at night.
-
- You show Mrs. Boss...
-
-
Sing Song, you and me are gonna
serenade 'em till 3:00, and, uh...
the safest shift is predawn, so that's
the boy soprano and his orchestra.
- All right? You're on till the sun comes up.
- Yes, boss.
All right.
Everybody get some shut-eye.
Uh, Mr. Drover...
I really don't think it's appropriate
to work a child of Nullah's age like that.
- But, Mrs. Boss, I plenty old enough.
-
- I'm talking now, hmm? Manners.
-
talking.
Look. Just relax, will ya?
The boy's gotta pull his weight
like everyone else.
When I was his age,
I was manning outstations.
- Not everybody's you, Mr. Drover.
- That's right.
Not everyone's me. I'm the boss.
You're on the 3:00 shift. All right?
Yes, boss.
-
- 3:00 a. m?
- Relax, lady. He'll be fine. Good night.
- Night, Mrs. Boss.
Oh. Good night.
Good night, Sing Song.
-
-
Night, Nullah.
Lord Ashley was killed
by a glass-tipped spear.
Are you sure?
You and me secret.
-
-
Rush! Rush!
Get on your horse
and stay with Goolaj.
Sing Song, pack the camp.
Get the hell out of there!
Don't let them split!
Get in the front!
Hyah! Hyah!
Nullah!
You're too close to the edge!
Well done, my boy!
Hyah!
Hey, hey!
Never fear, Flynn is here!
- Yeah, Flynn!
- Hyah!
Flynn!
Flynn!
Nullah, run!
-
- ##
Nullah!
-
-
-
-
Oh! Oh.
Oh.
It's all right. You're safe.
I've got you.
You're safe.
You're safe with me.
I'll stay with you.
Hey.
How's the little fella?
- Oh, he's fine. He's fine.
- Yeah.
I have a feeling I might not be able
to complete the next lesson.
Right, old mate.
I'm gonna get you some water, huh?
Water's the last thing I want
at this moment in my life.
Under the wagon-
a bottle of Poor Fella.
I'm sorry, Drover. Just in case.
Of course, mate. Of course.
If you'd all share a drop.
It would be a terrible shame
to waste it.
The spear- Nullah told me.
A glass-tipped spear.
Tell milady I'm sorry.
I was a coward.
We lost just about everything,
except for a few swags and tins of beef.
And this.
I can't believe I was so insistent
upon bringing these...
silly things.
It was Fletcher who did this,
wasn't it?
The last thing Flynn told me
before he died was that-
by a glass-tipped spear...
like the ornamental ones
in the homestead.
King George is from Arnhem.
- Fletcher.
- It can't be proved.
Maitland-
##
We can't let them win.
We won't.
Get 'em up!
-
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
They pushed on during the night.
Maybe that little creamy
has got the blackfella magic.
Shut up, Bull!
They're gonna need more than magic
to get 'em to Darwin.
Hey, Nullah.
Nullah, after you're done, I need you
to help hobble these horses. All right?
Yes, boss.
- We're gonna break the Drover's law.
- I plenty old enough too!
Yes, you are, and that is why you
are gonna keep an eye on the rest of us.
All right?
- All right, everyone. Let's be upstanding.
- Good girl, Jedda. Here.
To the memory of the gentleman.
- To the gentleman.
- To Flynn!
-
-
-
-
I'd say one more before dinner.
##
- Let's dance.
- No.
- Come on!
- No. No.
Come on. Please?
- No. I don't know how.
- It's easy. I'll show you.
You put your hands on my shoulders.
And you step back.
- Back. No, no.
- Oh, back. Sorry.
- I'm a bad teacher.
- Stop!
-
- You don't drink much, do you?
No.
-
- Uh-
-
- Uh, yes. It's called the fox-trot.
Fox dance?
You gonna teach me that dance?
- Uh, you're a bit too young for her, mate.
-
Get down from that tree now!
Got bad spirits up there.
You're in big trouble.
Uh, yeah.
- Oh.
- Yeah. I was married once.
- Really?
- Mmm. To a lovely girl.
That was before I went off to war.
And what happened?
Well, I marched off
for Mother England...
and by the time I came back,
she was sick...
with T.B.
But back then, the hospitals
wouldn't treat, um, blacks.
Oh, right. I see. Yeah.
Do you have children?
- No.
- Well, that's a shame.
I think you would have
made a great father.
- You?
- No.
I can't.
Oh.
That's too bad.
You would have made a great mother.
Well, good night.
- Good night.
- Yeah.
- Water no good, boss.
- No.
Might be Carney boys
already been here, eh?
There has to be water
some other place.
- Next bore is five days.
- There has to be water.
You can be sure Fletcher
will have been there as well.
-
- What?
There's water three days' ride away.
- We've got to try.
- We can't.
- We've got to try.
- No one has drove the Never-Never.
There's nothing to guide you.
You don't know where you are.
You get caught out there,
you're gonna lose more than your cattle.
I'm sorry.
Boss!
Sing?
He can find his way anywhere.
-
-
Keep driving into the wind!
- I'm
-
I magic man. I wizard man.
Dead as doorposts they were.
- It's a real tragedy.
- How terrible!
What were they doing in the Kuraman?
but I got a business to run,
and you got an army to feed.
So let's not muck about.
I suppose it's not a real war
unless someone's making a profit.
- You got 'em ready to load, Neil?
- Yeah, we're right to go.
'Cause I got a feeling the captain's
gonna put pen to paper.
All hail the king. Yeah.
-
-
Oh, look.
- Hello, little sweetie.
-
What the bloody hell is that?
Gentlemen!
I'm Sarah Ashley,
owner of Faraway Downs.
- We're full.
- Says who?
- The owner.
- You must be Mr. Carney.
Too right, love.
I'm the officer in charge
of livestock purchases.
We will accept 20% less than what
the Carney Cattle Company is asking.
No can do, love.
You're late. The contract's signed.
This contract is not binding
until the cattle are loaded.
Load the bloody cattle now!
We've got to load the cattle
on the ship before Carney.
- Get off your backsides!
- You drive 'em straight down the wharf.
I'll try and keep Carney's cattle
in the yard.
Load the bloody cattle now!
- Drover!
- Hyah!
Load!
You blokes, load!
Hyah!
Hey, Bull!
Open the bloody crush!
Come on!
Close that flamin' gate!
You missed the boat, sunshine.
Over here, Drover.
Hyah!
Push 'em straight down the wharf!
Hah!
-
- Hyah!
