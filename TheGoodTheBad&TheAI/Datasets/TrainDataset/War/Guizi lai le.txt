Eat me, why don't you?
Now that's silly.
Isn't it a capital crime

Trying to send me to the gallows?
Auntie This is a mater of decency
Decency?
You've a mistress in your bed
and Japs in your cellar
Son of a bitch!
You swearing at me?
NO,not you Er Bozi
I'm his mother
Curses at him travel straight to me
You don't understand
He swears at me, too
He hasn't kept his word.
He said he wouldn't tell you
If he lied to me,
He wouldn't be my son,
Whatever you say.
But I really need your help
Auntie.
You're fond of me,aren't you?
这两天我就为这俩人
I've done so much for these two men.
For the village
I've slept with my clothes on
I've spent night in the cellar
That's your fault.
I have no choice!
The Jap's threatening suicide!
He won't eat..
Unless his food's made of flour
Otherwise, he'll starve himself
It's mess
If you care about me...
You won't let me leave empty hand,
will you?
That's exactly how you'll leave today
A man going to starve
Let him starve
Japs are monsters anyway
That's no good.
If they starve,
our village is done for
I'd rather die than be a collaborator
What're you talking about?
This guy risks his neck to bring 'em
ask us to look after 'em
And we let'em starve?
What's a collaborator?
That's a collaborator
keep talking,there's no flour!
What's in here?
nothing
There's flour inside the chest
in the blue bag.
Who told you that?
who?The one who keep secrets.
He tells me stuff too.
That damn son of mine!
I don't care anyway,
There's none
Auntie，How's this?
I'll repay you double what I take
Triple it.There is none
Four times
Five times
and there's still none
How about six?
Seven and I'll give none!
All right. 8 then!
Dong teach me some chinese
what?
I want to swear at them.
To use the most terrible words.
Hummiate them
and they'll have to kill me.
Basterd!Teach me now.
Yes,sir
Cut it out
At a time like this,Thinking of that
You've heard them call us
brother and sister in law
Besides．．．when I saw Auntie,
I tell her all about us
What'd you sy?
I sadi... it is what it is
Have you no shame?
She said,no story,no flour
She wasn't nasty about it.
Things are what they are
Why not just admit it?
Don't push it，They're all ben too
Busy to think about us
After tonight,
when those two leave
How can I walk in the streets
with everyone talking behind my back?
What can I do?
If a big man like you doesn't know,
Why ask me?
Well．．．
I'll marry you
You have to anyway!
What're you saying?
You have no choice
Who's there?
Me!
It's him!
It's me!
Don't use that word!
It scares me!
I've got their statement
When the guy comes
Give him this,
I'm glad I didn't forget
Anyway, we've made it.
True!
Once they've left
we can celebrate New Year's...
all over again.
They're here，Dong
The time's come
I hear their footsteps.
I can see them taking up their weapons.
I want to turn the curses
you've tought me
in to bullets to fire them!
I want to enrage them!
Dong, Goodbye forever!
Brother and sister-in-low,
happy new year!
You're my granddad, I'm your son.
Brother and sister-in-low,
happy new year!
You're my granddad, I'm your son.
The words are nice.
Why dose he sound so angry?
Japs sound the same,
whether they're happy and angry.
Why d'ya think we call them devils?
Brother and sister-in-low,
happy new year!
You're my granddad, I'm your son.
Enough,
I get the message.
But your generations are mixed up,
If i'm your granddad,
you're my grandson,
Not my son. See?
How come they're not angry?
Japanese are always cursing them.
They're used to it.
Brother and sister-on-law, happy...
Okay, okay. Shush.
Twice is enough.
We've made you dumplings.
Just what you asked for.
Did you teach him that?
Yes. It's the spring festival.
I tought him propitious phrases
to thank you both.
Nice of you.
Now, eatup. It's your last chance.
By tonight, you'll be on the road.
Let's bring over the table.
Hold on. We'll set this up.
Eat hearty.
Hoarders!
I'll kill you for sure.
No chance of that.
Why not?
"On the road" means "to die" in Chinese.
This is our last meal!!
We're goners!
Why don't the act
like they gonna kill us?
Even when a chinese kills someone,
his expression never changes.
How are they gonna kill us?
You afraid of dying?
I just feel stupid dying this way.
But I'm not afraid.
I won't beg for mercy.
Shall we do it?
Move aside.
Let'em finish their meal.
Untie them.
Please, one favour!
Send my parents a message for me,
in the northeast.
Of course.
Don't panic.
You'll be on the road soon.
And whatever happens, happens.
Enjoy your dumplings.
All right. I will!
And then, i'll go on the road.
I lived by my mouth,
Now i'll die for it.
If only I hadn't learned Japanese!
In my next life,
I'll come back a mute.
Eat up...
Or we'll be lat.
Tell him...
we've still got to trouble you
to get back into those sacks.
What?
They're putting us back
into those sacks
What now?
The Japs are like this.
They cry, they sing.
before he goes,
we should give him a drink?
I want a drink!
He'd like a drink.
Just what we were thinking.
Let's get some wine from Old Man Qi.
San... think they'll give us a reward?
Go!
It's time for lunch.
I'm not going.
Not going to the Base?
No. We're having Chinese chicken today.
You serious?
Know how to get a chicken
from a Chinese?
'Excuse me, can you give me a chicken? '
Idiot! You wouldn't get anything in that way!
Watch me.

Now he's talking..
Let's sit over there.

Bakayaro! Fool!

Japanese speaking Japanese.
Soldiers of the imperial Army!
You stay here.
I'll get some kids to make noise.
Okay!
The Japs want more water.
It's ture!
There are Japanese up there!
Heaven's looking after us.
Becarful.
How'd they get here?
I ran into them.
Not you bring it here?
Captain-san.
Go fan the fire.
Our chicken is nearly ready.
I'm going to scream!
They still won't hear you.
Hanaya.
I've got an idea!
Don't worry about us.
We've got our own luch.
We'll save you the bones.
It was bloody delicious.
Why did he hit you?
I said 'knock you block off'.
Can't you say the opposite?
Well... you try.
Not me.
I can only say bakayaro!
It's worse.
Say baka-NO-yaro!
Cut the crap.
I'll watch them.
I have a idea.
Please save us!
Please save us.

Son of a bitch!

San, he's gone inside!
Move! Move!
What're you doing with that?
Captain.

at the very sight of us.
They thinks us can eata donkey!
Idiot!
That pretty maid.

I am going to do my best.
Maruyamo!
Get your gun!
San!
What're you doing?
I'm getting you another chicken.
I see.
This gun...very good.
Save it...We eat next time.
Understand?
Understand.
We should be at our posts.
Right.
Playtime's over.
Two telephone lines to set up.
Why's he always waving
a knife around?
Get back!
No move!
You scared?
Course not.Not with you around.
Sensei...
Look at this!
What now?
That idiot is still inside the circle!
You're something else!
You're got these mongrels worked out.
I can teach you a few things.
I'm still learning.
You?Still learning?
You're never too old to learn.
Fucking cunts!
What're you doing?
Japanese soldiers!
They're coming!
Fuck you,Jap!Fuck!
Fucking cunts!
Move!
Turtle-fuckers!
What the fuck is this about?
So you pull this on me!
Trying to get me killed?
Get this straight.
You try and get me killed...
and I'll kill you first!
What's going on when you left the village?
I left the village.
Crossed the river.
Climbed the mountain.
Entered the town.
Went to ask fot Pockmarked Li.
Get the point!
This is the point.
You always leave the village,
cross the river...
If i didn't leave the village.
How could i cross the river?
Give me some water.
Go on!
Where was I?
Crossing the river...
Get the point.
You saw Pockmarked Li.
I didn't say that.
You did.
I said i saw Captain Five.
What did Captain Five say?
He said,
'Haven't i told you what i do?'
I said,'No,i've never met you before.'
Captain Five said,
'Are you from Xia-Village?'
'I'm from Rock-Armour Terrace.'
He said,'Rock-Armour Terrace?'
'We've never left anyone there.
Do what you have to.'
I said,'What's that?'
He said,'You've a blockhouse there?'
'What are you waiting for?
Do the deed.'
So this captain said'do the deed'.
Yeah.
He gestured like this.
'Do it!'
'Do it!'
Tell us again.
What was that gesture?
Was it like this?
Or that?
Like this.
So he meant kill 'em!
No.
What do you mean?
Like this...like this...
Of course he meant kill 'em.
Looks like it!
There's an old saying:
Better to obey than respects to pay.
Well...
better obey then.
Old Uncle,if he wanted us to kill 'em,
why didn't he say so?
Why say 'do the deed'?
Men in hidh postions
can't always sat what they mean.
It was so clear!First those guns
yelled out to the brass band.
Then,today,
they tagged the chicken.
What's next?
Better to obey orders.
Did he sat how to do it?
No
Or who should do it?
No.He doesn't know us.
How could he?
He knows you!
Be thought i was from Lower Village.
Never saw him before.
This is a hard one.
What's so hard?
Japs are all bastards.
More water!
I'll throttle 'em
Twist their necks and bury 'em!
Shut up!
Bury 'em?That's an idea.
So...
It's not that i'm afraid.
How can i put this?
It's not right.
Why not?
We were told to look after them.
We can't just decide to kill them.
It's not good.
Besides,that Captain Five
who Liu Wang found.
Didn't drop 'em on us.
His orders don't count.
What if Captain Four or Captain Seven
comes for 'em?What then?
So why don't you go your self?
Go find Captain Four or seven?
Don't be stupid.
Uncle.
Stop looking at me!
If I weren't such a wuss, I'd do it.
We've got to reason this out.
Why? My putty mouth came from my mom,
never true at all.
If I let go of my mouth,
everyone in the village would be dead.
Our village is that famous?
I've kept my mouth shut for over half a year.
I "sensei" this and that all day along to keep quiet
Thats my contribution
That's some hard work.
Hard Work?
'Sensei'You,collaborator!
You do it then!
Well...Liu Wang
What the heck are you looking at me for?
What should I be scared of?
lets get this straight.
You know the saying
"Stick your neck out"?
Thats me!
I almost died at the entrance
of village, today.
Why do I keep on saying,
out of the village, over the river
Because it makes me sick
I even dream of leave out of the village,
cross the river, leave,cross,leave...
And you scold me for slurping?
Give me that
I'd choke them to death,
one after one, and bury them.
Don't talk about it any more!
If you guys aint gona do it, then I will.
You wont do it, then leave to me.
We'll draw lots then
heaven will decide
Whoever catches this red bean do it.
Uncle
Two big guys... can't even handle it
then find one more.
Forget it, I've got both.
Give me some water.
Bro, give it.
