ANNOUNCER:
from the German bombs
dropped last night by Hitler's Luftwaffe.
The countless dead are
being dug from the rubble,
the German armies
wait for this country to surrender.
and in the skies,
the young men of the Royal Air Force
are struggling against the Nazi
forces, which, only a year ago,
and left this country standing alone
in a conflict, which, if lost,
Very good, Sergeant Major,
move the men in.
Right.
All right, you lads! Move!
MAN:
Sorry, lads, mind your backs. Gangway.
Mind your backs.
SERGEANT MAJOR: Move!
I found the four extra carriages you need.
Good.
You'll have your thousand men,
unfed, but they'll be there.
I'd rather be with them
than in this madhouse.
Finland appeals to you, does it?
Is it the country or the ladies?
Just a brief surge of patriotism.
You coming for a drink?
Thanks, no. Perhaps tomorrow.
Hello?
MAN: See you in the morning.
Yes.
Three that I can see from here.
Cheers.
Mr. Faber?
Hello, Billy.
I've got another
interview with the Army tomorrow.
I don't think
you look any older than you did last week.
Oh, but my mate Harry,
he's got some cream.
He said it will take
the pimples off just like that.
There's no need to rush, Billy.
There'll be plenty of war left.
I can promise you.
But I want to fight now.
BILLY: Everyone's in uniform except me.
Well, unless they got
a special job like you.
What about the Navy, Billy?
Yeah, well, I've been
thinking about the Navy,
but, well, I can't swim a stroke.
Oh, then the Air Force is out.
Why?
Well, you haven't got wings, have you?
- There you go, my love.
- Thank you.
- MAN: All the best, love.
- Thank you.
- MAN: Our very best.
- WOMAN 2: Good luck, darling.
Thank you.
Uh, Mrs. Rose?
David, darling?
I think I'd better go and get changed.
Can I help?
No, you can't.
Well, my boy, when do
you join your squadron?
- Tomorrow, sir.
- Oh.
Spitfire. I saw her yesterday. Lovely kite.
All right, then, there we are.
Mama...
Oh, Mama, I'm so happy.
Oh, darling.
He is a lovely boy.
Isn't he?
Darling.
Off you go, Emma.
Both of you.
- Lucy?
- LUCY: Yes?
Lucy, I...
I don't know what
you're expecting tonight but I...
Well, I... I think you should know that...
Mama, I do know.
Goodbye, mother.
ALL:
Bye!
Bye!
Bye!
Oi, Billy, you missed your tea.
And you, Faber.
Come and have some at the pub.
Thanks, I'll just have a quick wash first.
- See you later then.
- Here, Freddie, can I come?
Oh, I don't know about that.
You in the Army yet?
Tell them about that miracle cream, Billy.
BILLY: Oh, yeah.
Will you tell Mrs. Garden I'll be late?
My mate Harry's got this cream...
Mr. Faber, I've kept
a nice piece of meat pie warm for you.
Well, we mustn't let that
go to waste, must we?
Not with this dreadful
rationing, we mustn't.
I'll be down in a minute.
for a honeymoon, is it?
We can start right now.
There's a bottle of bubbly down there.
So there is.
There we are. Are there glasses?
But of course. Everything supplied.
Oh, dear.
What?
Well, I was just thinking of Mother.
This afternoon she tried to tell me
what happens on a wedding night.
She's a bit late, isn't she?
What did you say?
Well, I said she was a bit late, didn't I?
Henry?
Mr. Faber?
What are you doing?
It's all right.
It's just for the station.
It's classified work
regarding train movements.
I shouldn't really even be telling you this.
No, no.
Listen to me for just...
No! No! No!
Trust me.
You're a spy.
Stop. Stop. God, please...
- No, no, no, no!
- Listen to me. Please, don't.
MAN ON RADIO: Last night, the Luftwaffe's
main target was again London.
Considerable damage was done
to residential and industrial areas
David, be careful.
You're not in your Spitfire yet.
-
- My God!
DAVID: Dearly beloved brethren,
the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.
He gives us the sheep,
and we give him back the bones.
Lucy, I think I've offended
your mother again.
I'm right here, David.
You may address me directly.
A tantalizing invitation.
LUCY: David, please.
Drink up, darling.
You'll be packed and ready, won't you?
You needn't worry. I'm ready now.
Good.
JO:  Daddy!
Mother, I apologize for David.
He finds it difficult to be with people now.
You understand.
Oh, of course, darling.
Oh, my poor girl.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm all right.
We are all all right, aren't we, Tom?
Aye, indeed we are.
Well, it's goodbye, mistress.
These are for you and your husband.
I know there isn't enough to eat
in London at the moment.
Thank you, Tom.
Thank you, Tom!
Come on, Tom.
He's drunk.
Mmm!
Is he always like that?
Most of the time, yes,
but he's a good friend to us.
Anytime you want to
come home, you and Jo...
No, no. My home is here,
Mother, with David and Jo.
Anyway it was you
who told me not expect marriage
to be uninterrupted pleasure, wasn't it?
- I'm afraid it was.
- Yes, it was.
Well, at least Jo seems well.
I kissed him on the ear.
Perhaps if you have another?
Why ever not? Surely David's capable.
Oh, yes.
But he can't bear to pass me in
the hallway for fear of touching me.
MAN: Come on, Lucy!
I do love you.
Now, it's not necessary to talk to father
about any of this, is it?
- No.
- No. Come on then.
- JO: Bye-bye, Grandma.
- LUCY: Come along, Jo.
Someone's in with Muller.
Good.
We'll give them 60 seconds and then go in.
You've left a trail
a blind man could follow.
We're surrounded.
Speak in English.
The  wants you
to reassess the strength
of General Patton's army in East Anglia.
It's invasion strength.
They have the aerial photographs.
General Patton is ready
to invade Europe at any time,
at Pas de Calais.
- Hitler's astrologer...
- An astrologer?
My God.
Well, he believes
the attack will be at Normandy.
All right.
I will reassess,
and I will signal in the usual way.
No.
Absolutely no further radio contact.
You have to take photographs.
You must deliver them
personally to the
Personally? Why personally?
He says he trusts you.
He wants to hear it from your own mouth.
Well, I'm flattered.
Admiral Canaris is sending a U-boat
to pick you up off the coast of Scotland.
That's nice of Willie.
Have you been carrying this around
with you ever since you arrived in England?
Yes. Why?
Let's go.
We'll get them both together.
What's this?
Storm Island, two miles
from the rendezvous.
The U-boat will pick me up when?
Only when you signal it,
from 6:00 in the evening
until 6:00 in the morning.
till 6:00 in the morning?
Beginning when?
Uh, a week from today
and for a week after that.
And you?
How will you get out of England?
I'm supposed to get
to, uh, Liverpool somehow.
If they capture you and torture you?
- I have a suicide pill.
- Would you use it?
Of course,
if necessary.
Jo wants me to say good night
to Daddy for him.
He love you very much.
I love him.
I know, but you don't show it.
You never tell him.
You never hold him.
You mustn't be afraid
now that he's growing up.
Afraid of what?
What the hell have I got to be afraid off?
I'm gonna go for walks with him, aren't I?
And swim with him?
And play football with him?
- David...
- I want him to be proud of me, don't I?
To grow up like his father,
a legless fucking joke?
I suppose you and your mother
had a lovely time discussing me.
She's very concerned about you.
I don't need anyone's concern.
I'll manage alone.
I can't.
David, I need you.
- I love you.
- Don't.
Please don't.
I want to sleep.
For God's sake, let me sleep!
Thank you.
And you haven't let this room to anybody
since the death of Mrs. Gunn?
Oh, no, sir, not since
Billy Parkin lived here.
He's in the Army now...
I think I've seen everything
I wanted to see.
Thank you very much.
Sergeant!
Billy Parkin?
That's right, sir.
Hello, sir.
What's this all about?
Murder.
BILLY: I'll never forget
coming back from the pub.
There she was,
dead.
Do you know that was
the worst shock of my life?
I'm sure.
Bloody Henry Faber.
My hero, he was.
Bastard.
Even wounded in the war.
Medals on his chest.
Anyway, what do you want me for?
What we have here, Sergeant,
are photographs of different German
military graduation classes.
Same year, different schools.
Take your time.
I am looking for Faber, am I?
Yes. Yes.
That's him!
Where?
Well, that's him.
That's Faber to the life.
And, look, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris,
the head of German Intelligence,
and right behind him, his young student,
"The Needle."
Going fishing?
- And a little bird-watching as well.
- If you're lucky.
Just keep to the far side of the canal.
Restricted area, this side.
Really?
Starts half a mile from here.
The man code-named "The Needle,"
also known as Henry Faber.
He was born on May 26, 1900,
at a village called Ulm in West Prussia.
At the age of 13,
he went to the Karlsruhe
Cadet School in Bonn.
Two years later, he was transferred
to the more prestigious
near Berlin.
because his father,
Baron Von Muller Gulder,
had been posted to Washington
as German military attache
and had sent his son
to private school there.
But, back in Germany, the boy rebelled
constantly against authority
He passed his final exam
with extremely high marks.
In the '20s, The Needle was a cadet
at the war school in Metz,
In '31, Hitler visited
the family estate and met him.
He had a passionate affair
with a German actress.
God.
Clever bastards.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
And who might you be?
I should be asking who you are.
You're on my boat.
What's in that bag?
Binoculars, camera, reference books.
Oh, no, you don't!
Put your hands up.
Would you mind?
Thanks you.
How nice to hear from you.
Of course!
Yes. That shouldn't be too difficult, sir.
You would prefer it in the morning?
By all means. Yes, yes, I...
Good night.
I want that
in the diplomatic pouch to Lisbon
this afternoon.
And from there to Berlin?
- As soon as possible.
- Fine.
May I ask you...
It's insurance.
You don't come to us very often.
Not very.
You keep to yourself, mmm?
A cautious man.
A cautious life.
But then, how else
could one survive these days?
One could stop.
Oh, but not you.
Training.
Patriotism.
- Good.
- Here, please.
Pull in here, cabby.
Thank you.
Do you know what these are, Godliman?
American aircraft.
These are photographs of Patton's
Allied invasion force in East Anglia.
As far as the Germans are concerned,
there are only two possible places
for an Allied invasion of Europe.
And they're right.
From East Anglia here to the Pas de Calais,
or from the south coast of England
to the beaches of Normandy.
Operation Overlord has
decided on Normandy.
Then what is General Patton's army
doing in East Anglia?
There is no army.
These planes are made out of plywood.
We did it to fool the Germans,
and the man who took
those photographs must know it.
Consequently, he must also know
that we intend to invade Normandy.
Find him, Godliman.
It could cost us the bloody war.
Well, sir, if you, uh, were at this station
and wanted to get out of the country,
you could go to Holyhead
or Liverpool or Glasgow
and then catch a ferry to Ireland.
No, he wouldn't risk Holyhead
because of the passport control.
How about Liverpool to Belfast?
Car across Ireland,
and a U-boat on the coast.
GODLIMAN: Liverpool?
In that case,
you're talking about our 11:45,
Marylebone to Inverness,
stopping at Stafford,
Crewe, Liverpool, Glasgow...
Liverpool. That's where he'll get off.
You're right.
Well, the 11:45 left on time.
Now how do we get on it?
Well, you could stop
the train this side of...
Stop the train. Get us a plane.
- Yes. Right, sir.
- You're coming with us, Billy.
- Fancy a game of poker, mate?
- Why not?
SAILOR: We're stopping again.
The engine driver probably ran out of coal.
Probably forgot his ration book.
Now, remember, Billy,
you're just to point him out to me.
BILLY: Don't you worry, sir.
I could recognize Faber in a stocking mask.
CONDUCTOR:
Blackout. Put your blinds down. Thank you.
Blackout.
Pull your blinds down.
Blackout.
- Oi!
- Hey!
MAN: Come on, give us a bit of room, pal.
BILLY: You shouldn't be on.
Someone take him away. Come on. Blimey!
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
-
Excuse me...
Be still, or I'll kill you.
Why are you looking for me?
I'm not.
Don't lie.
Has the Army changed its uniforms, Billy?
What's the plan?
Where's the trap?
Glasgow. They're waiting for you
at Glasgow.
So they finally let you in the Army,
did they, Billy?
Congratulations.
Yeah.
WOMAN: Oh, my God!
Hmm.
Thank you. You've been terribly kind.
Yeah. You won't change
your mind and come home
and have a spot of lunch with me?
No, I must get on to Banff.
Oh, well. As you like.
I hope your car's still there
when you get back to it.
It won't get far without petrol.
NEWSREEL NARRATOR: The Red Army
has been scoring huge successes
striking back with tanks and troops
all along the Eastern Front.
Hitler's armies have suffered
a series of humiliating defeats
All this at the very moment
Hitler was saying
that the word "surrender"
is not to be found in the German vocabulary.
And now the American
and British Air Forces
have stepped up
their daylight bombing of Germany.
Mr. Churchill and General Eisenhower
are once again in conference,
a massive attack by the Allies
on the continent of Europe
The fatal question
for the Nazi command must be
"Where and when will
the invasion take place?"
MULLER:
from 6:00 in the evening
until 6:00 in the morning.
You must deliver the photographs
personally to the Fuehrer.
FABER:
MAN: Aye, that's the fellow.
I picked him up in the middle of nowhere.
Can't tell you what a fool I felt
when I saw this.
So you're positive it was the same man?
-
- I offered him lunch.
And he was going to Banff?
I dropped him right opposite.
POLICEMAN: Scotland Yard on the line, sir.
At last.
Scotland Yard?
I know it's late. It's late here, too.
David!
Put your arm around me.
That's it.
Well, these are ten more sightings
of your man.
All checked?
We've interviewed eight of them.
We're on to the other two.
We've knocked on almost every door
from Cape Wrath to Carlisle.
If he is on the coast,
he hasn't got a roof over his head.
You're on Storm Island.
Storm Island?
Now you know how it got its name.
You were swept into the bay here.
Everything always is.
Please, don't get up.
I've frightened your little girl.
He's a boy.
I'm sorry.
No, I must cut his hair.
Was anyone else on board with you?
David, we really must put
the poor man to bed.
No, I was alone.
Didn't you bother to get
a weather report before you left?
No.
Did you notify the Coastguard of your route?
David, darling, what does it matter?
It matters, because if he did,
there may be men out there
risking their lives looking for him.
We can let them know
that he's sitting here safe and sound.
No. No, um...
No. I did not notify the Coastguard.
I'll just turn the bed down.
Oops.
Okay.
I've never seen anybody so exhausted.
But Mummy...
No, darling, you must play terribly quietly
so that the man upstairs
can have a nice long sleep.
He won't hear anything, the state he's in.
- Mummy, why?
- David,
who do you suppose he is?
A damn fool, to be out in this weather.
Well, he's not a working sailor.
He's not a working sailor?
No. Didn't you notice his hands?
They're terribly soft.
His hands?
He's wearing a suit, for God's sake.
You're bloody observant
all of a sudden, aren't you?
I'm going over to Tom's.
David! Suppose he wakes up?
Um, who is that man in my room, Mummy?
I don't know, darling.
...with diamonds in it!
You know what diamonds are, don't you?
Sort of treasures, aren't they?
We must cut your hair soon.
If you didn't,
would it grow and grow and grow?
Yes, it would grow down to your ears.
Then it would grow down to your chin.
Then it would grow down past here.
Then it would curl up here.
Then it would go down here.
Then it would start tickling your feet!
Then we'd all have to get out of the bath!
Why?
Because if people
don't get out of their baths
they
melt!
But I haven't.
Mummy?
Mummy, can I have my room back?
Of course you can.
Come on, darling.
Get out of the bath!
LUCY: Do try not to ask questions, David.
DAVID: I want to cross-question him.
It seems perfectly normal
to wonder who he is.
I just think it would
be nice if you didn't go on at him.
I'm only trying to find out what happened.
Come in.
Good evening.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
Better, thank you.
I'm Henry Baker.
Hello. I'm Lucy. Lucy Rose.
How do you do?
This is my husband, David.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Have some hot soup.
Thank you.
- Bread?
- Yes, thank you.
Can you tell me the time, please?
It's 10 to 9:00
DAVID: Help yourself to cider.
No, thank you.
Thank you.
I am very hungry.
This is Storm Island?
That's right.
And what do you do here?
Sheep farmer.
Really?
Look, I'm going to bed.
My back's playing up.
You're a damn fool, you know.
Lucky to be alive.
Why were you out in the storm
in the first place?
Because I had no idea
it was going to be so severe.
Give me two. I want to sleep.
I can do that.
Good night.
Would you like some more soup?
No, thank you.
It was delicious.
There's some brandy next door.
Would you like some?
Do sit down.
Where do you live, Mr. Baker?
I used to live on that boat.
Suppose I am a damn fool.
I moved from London about a month ago.
Really?
I haven't been to London for years.
When were you last there?
Four years ago.
And that was to have a baby.
- You've been here for four years?
- Yes.
My goodness. I hope you have friends here.
Well, there's Tom,
who takes care of the lighthouse,
and the ferry comes
every other Monday with our supplies.
- That's all?
- Yes.
Cheers.
Cheers.
What do you do if there is an emergency?
Well, there's a radio transmitter
at Tom's cottage,
but that's really
more to do with the lighthouse.
It seems a terribly lonely place to live.
Well, you see,
David and I had a motor accident
on the day we were married.
That's how he lost his legs.
He was training to be a fighter pilot,
and then after the accident, he...
Well, we both wanted to run away,
and so we came here.
Seemed like a good idea.
Might have been a mistake.
Well, you can't blame him
for wanting to run away.
No, I don't.
It's terribly sad.
No, it was our fault completely.
We'd had a bit to drink,
and we were driving much too fast,
and then suddenly there was this lorry...
No, I meant it was terribly sad
because you're so unhappy now.
Is it that obvious?
I do love him, you know.
The way he used to be.
Times when he's suddenly like the old David
and he and Jo and I
go and have a picnic on the cliff
or something like that...
He spends most of his time now with Tom.
I think they just sit and drink.
The first year that we were here,
my parents came to visit.
Oh, I can't tell you...
He was silent,
and he hid from them, and...
I feel sad for Jo, really.
He keeps asking about
his Granny and where she is.
He's a nice little boy.
Oh, isn't he?
And he's so clever.
And he's very brave.
And lucky.
Why do you think?
To be so loved.
No.
No. I'm his mother.
All parents love their children.
No, no.
No, not all.
No.
Some parents...
Some parents use their children,
set goals for them.
Goals they weren't able
to attain in their lives.
Hardly love, do you think?
No, hardly.
I wonder why you go on
if it's not working.
I suppose, if I were perfectly frank,
I'd admit that I couldn't bear the idea
that all the years of trying were wasted.
I really don't think
I could bear that.
Oh, dear, four years on this island,
and I've become such a bore.
Tell me, Mr. Baker, are you married?
No.
What, through choice or bad luck?
Do you think it's good luck to be married?
Well, yes, normally.
Sometimes I imagine myself married...
To another man?
You've hurt yourself.
I'm awfully sorry.
You're very beautiful.
Please don't.
We tied up Friday afternoon nice and early
to keep out of that bloody storm.
It's Sunday.
Why did you not let us know she was gone?
I haven't been down here since!
McKilliam.
Could that boat have survived the storm?
Not a chance.
Why do you think I left her here?
If he were on it,
where could he be now?
At the bottom of the sea, the bloody fool.
Aye! Good riddance to bad rubbish.
He'd be drowned.
I'll believe that when I see the body.
Good morning.
I've saved you some coffee.
Do you take black or white?
No, thank you.
I'll make you some breakfast.
No. I'll wait for lunch.
It's lamb stew for lunch, I'm afraid.
David says it won't be long
before we all turn into sheep.
Where is he?
David? He's just gone out with Jo
to check on the flock.
Good morning, Lucy.
Good morning.
You don't despise me, do you?
No.
How could I?
Oh, you could.
I could.
It can't happen again.
It won't.
Do you regret it?
Oh...
Let's go out.
You'll be gone soon,
now the storm's over.
Not in that, I won't.
I don't even know what you do.
I'm a writer.
A writer? Are you really?
Good Lord.
What do you write about?
The war.
No, not battles and killing,
but isolation.
The feeling some men have
of being suddenly separated
from every other man.
But I thought war was meant
to bring people closer together.
Well...
Not me.
And you?
Is there a woman in your book?
I shall put you in it.
- No, really, is there?
- Yes.
One woman.
What does she do?
She lives.
Has an affair with our hero.
- Then she dies.
- What, in the blitz?
No.
He kills her.
She broke his heart.
I'd better get back there.
He'll be coming.
I hope Lucy didn't keep you up
too late last night.
No.
I'm going over to Tom's,
see if he's repaired the transmitter aerial.
Would you like to come along?
If I can help, yes.
I'll get my jacket.
I'll be in the truck.
Can I come, too, Daddy?
No. You stay with Mummy.
You've been out once today already.
We'll walk over later, darling.
Go and say goodbye.
Daddy, why can't I come?
I think he knows.
How could he?
I don't know. I just feel it.
You feel guilty.
Don't.
My wife
tells me you're a writer.
Successful?
Just beginning.
Why aren't you in the forces?
I was.
I was wounded.
So was I.
- You married?
- No.
DAVID: Wise man.
What I'd do with that freedom.
I should think
you're very fortunate to have Lucy.
Oh? Would you?
Yes, I would.
I used to fly Spitfires.
Beautiful kites.
Four guns on each wing.
American Brownings.
Fired 1,260 rounds a minute.
Really?
Aren't you interested in aircraft?
No.
I should have thought
you'd be an enthusiast.
Why?
It's become a national pastime, hasn't it?
Aircraft spotting.
DAVID: Tom?
Tom!
You mind going inside, seeing if he's there?
If he's not, we'll scout around.
He won't be far.
Tom!
DAVID: Tom!
Is he in there?
He's sleeping.
Or rather, he's drunk himself unconscious.
You lied to me, didn't you?
What are you talking about?
You said you weren't interested in aircraft.
I'm not.
Oh, but you are.
Oh, you're very interested.
Give me the film.
What film?
The can of film
I found in your pocket this morning.
Yes, that's the one.
On your knees.
This is ridiculous.
If this is because of Lucy...
Those are photographs of our aircraft.
You've been spying.
I work for the RAF.
- I was delivering that film...
- Save it for Lucy.
She'll be here soon.
She's fascinated by everything
you've got to say, isn't she?
Now bring me the film.
On your knees.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
Hello!
JO: Hello.
Hello, Jo.
- JO: Hello.
-
Hello.
LUCY: Hello. Where's David?
Drunk.
Let's go back home then, darling.
Daddy's busy.
Shall we?
Was it all right? Did he say anything?
Nothing.
I'll go and collect him after supper.
Come on, then!
Jo's asleep.
He said to say good night to you.
What are you thinking?
Do you realize what time it is?
I must go.
I must go and
fetch your husband.
You feel guilty.
Don't.
Godliman!
Godliman here.
breathing fire, not five minutes ago.
- Listen, man...
He must not get back to Germany.
Understood.
Mummy?
What the hell are you doing?
Jo, we can make a drawing
of all the things that the storm did.
We could draw Mr. Baker's boat
- against the rock, couldn't we?
- JO: Mmm.
And we could draw all the clouds,
all the black clouds that came out...
Look, Jo.
You can see the cliffs perfectly clearly.
Can you see them?
Aren't they pretty?
Jo, darling, stay here. Don't move.
And don't go near the cliff.
My God!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, David.
Help!
Help!
Somebody!
Help!
Somebody!
What was in the water, Mummy?
Jo, darling, Mummy has to go out now.
You're going to be a good boy and stay here
and play with your toys, will you?
Henry!
Where are you going, Mummy?
I'm going over to Tom's, darling.
Your husband refuses to come back.
He and Tom have been drinking, and...
Lucy?
Oh, there you are.
Have you been out?
Yes. We were out walking.
Would you like some coffee?
We saw something in the water.
We were looking at the wreck of your boat.
Quite a mess, isn't it, Jo?
Would you like some coffee?
No, thank you.
Have you just seen David?
Just now, yes.
Somehow, they've managed
to fix the aerial...
Lucy?
-
- FABER: Here are the keys.
Where are you going?
I thought I'd better get David.
He really mustn't drink so much.
Oh, please, leave him.
He told me to fetch him at teatime.
Leave him till then.
Let's have a picnic.
Shall we make some sandwiches, Jo?
Once we went for a picnic
at the sea in spring.
FABER: You'd enjoy that, wouldn't you?
Yes, I'd like that very much.
I do love you.
FABER: "'I am going to the house
of death,' said the swallow.
"'is he not?'
"And he kissed the happy prince
"and fell down dead at his feet.
"A curious crack sounded inside the statue,
"as if something had broken.
"The fact is
"that the leaden heart had snapped
"right in two.
"'What a strange thing!' said the
overseer of the workmen at the foundry.
"'This broken lead heart
will not melt in the furnace.'
"So they threw it on the dustheap
"where the dead swallow was also lying.
"'Bring me the two most precious things
in the city,' said God.
"The angel brought him the leaden heart
"and the dead bird.
"'You have rightly chosen,' said God.
"'For in my garden of paradise,
"'this little bird shall sing forevermore,
"'and in my city of gold,
""the happy prince shall praise me.""
Come and have your milk, darling.
I tell you what.
If you're a very, very good boy
and drink up all your milk,
you can sleep in front of the fire tonight.
Would you like that?
Mmm.
Yes.
What islands did you say haven't reported?
Sandevista, Uist and Storm,
and that one's not worth worrying about.
- Which?
- Storm Island.
We can never raise Tom
in the evenings, can we, sir?
Well, old Tom does like a little drink
at the end of a hard day.
How do I get onto these islands?
In this weather?
I'll go get us something to drink, shall I?
I won't be a minute.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm coming!
Come along, darling.
Come on!
-
- Please, God!
Lucy!
-
-
Tom!
Tom!
Tom!
Tom?
Tom!
Oh, my God.
Tom, you must wake up.
It's Lucy.
Tom?
Oh, my God.
Lucy!
LUCY: I'm trying to send an urgent...
Hello?
Please, if anyone hears me...
Please, I'm sending
an urgent message from...
Hello!
Do you hear me?
This is Storm Island sending an urgent SOS.
Please, if you hear me,
could you let me know?
And we are looking for any German vessel.
It's probably a U-boat.
When we return to refuel,
the next squadron will
already be on its way.
So, all we need is the weather, sir.
Oh, to hell with the weather.
Well, we can't take off in this fog.
I know, I know, I know.
- We've just picked up an SOS, sir.
- From where?
We don't know yet.
Hello? Are you receiving me? Over.
Hello. Are you receiving me? Over.
- FABER: Lucy!
-
Oh, my God!
Lucy!
No!
Oh, no!
Go back upstairs.
Mummy, I'm cold.
Run!
-
-
Lucy?
I know you don't have any shells left
and I'm going to open the door.
Please, I have to come in.
I'm not going to hurt you, Lucy, I promise.
But I am coming in.
But I am coming in.
JO: Mummy! Mummy, help!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Everything's all right now.
You're all right now. Come.
We'll lock the door.
This is Storm Island.
Is there anyone there? Please?
MAN:
We've been trying
to raise you all night. Over.
Let me talk to her.
Hello. Can you hear me?
There was a man shipwrecked on our island.
He killed my husband
and our shepherd, Tom.
He's outside of the house now,
so please come, for God's sake.
Over.
GODLIMAN:
Yes. I understand. Over.
But why?
Please, don't...
No! I can't do that!
I've got no one else here to help me!
Jo, stay there.
Jo!
Put the gun there.
Stand by the door.
There's a bottle of whiskey
in the other room, Lucy.
Would you bring it to me, please?
- FABER: General Patton's army...
-
Good God.
The war's come down to the two of us.
Do you know that?
I did what I had to do.
And it cannot be undone.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye.
JO: Mummy!
Mummy!
Yes! It's all right, honey, it's all right.
It's all right.
Now, you must stay here.
Stay here, will you?
Stay here and wait for Mummy.
Oh, no!
Stop!
Please stop!
Stop, please!
Stop, please!
Oh...
