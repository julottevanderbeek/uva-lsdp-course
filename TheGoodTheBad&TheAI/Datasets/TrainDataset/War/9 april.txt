Early in the morning of April 9th 1940,
German troops pass the border
between Denmark and Germany.
The unprepared and badly equipped Danish
Army meets Europe's strongest military power.
The hardest battles
take place in Southern Jutland.
Sec. lieutenant, the lieutenant told me
to drive you to the training area.
There is a tense mood
at the barracks.
They have communicated with Copenhagen.
But nobody wants to talk.
I know just as little as you, sergeant.
Then she won't answer,
so I lean carefully towards her.
- You know what she says then?
No.
Hell, she doesn't wan't a soldier.
We need to speed up. We are in a hurry.
What have you done?
Worked with my father.
I haven't seen Ingrid as much.
You'll see her again soon.
- What about you, Gram?
- Yeah, What about me?
- So, what have you done?
Like you wan't to know.
Then you can joke with it,
on my behalf.
- You always think the worst of me.
Yes.
Come on, Gram.
Please tell us.
If you really wan't to know.
I have just been home, at my folks place.
Gotten my clothes washed.
Read a book.
Sometimes I get really sad
on your behalf, Gram
Gram?
Why do you think,
our passes have been revoked?
You probably got the same answer.
It's a test alarming.
It is just a drill.
Second lieutenant.
Lieutenant.
Now we're here again.
Another round of the wolf is coming.
I thought that,
its probably not just a drill.
We received information about night shipments
of military equipment in Kiel.
A train with troops was seen going north,
towards the border.
That doesn't sound good.
The General Staff shares your worries,
all passes are revoked.
They have sent a motorcycle platoon down,
which we will be supporting.
Led by a sergeant Bundgaard.
You are late. Drop the bags, get weapons.
Join the shooting exercise.
The three privates.
Give them kitchen duty for the week.
Roger, lieutenant.
Kitchen duty for a week.
Perfect.
Good shot.
Try again.
We aren't here for the fun of it.
I don't know who I am most afraid of.
Lassen or the Germans.
I can't if you laugh at me.
You don't hit anything anyways.
Something to drink?
Coffee, thanks.
Cognac.
If you ask me,
the Germans are going to Norway.
They wan't the Norwegian waters.
Denmark have no strategic value.
Our southern neighbors haven't
exactly been predictable.
Thank you.
You must be tired.
When did you wake up?
At three o'clock.
I tried to sneak out, but of course
i woke up the whole home.
Now, you didn't make your
wife unnecessarily worried?
I said nothing,
but my wife knows me too well.
It's not the first time the Germans move,
without anything happening.
Let's see.
We are ending the shooting exercise.
Next exercise are by the bikes.
Go to the bikes. Move!
- Hi, Gram.
Good to see you.
Are you better at hitting your targets?
Go to the bikes, faster!
Ready sergeant.
Ready sergeant.
Perfect, first exercise, change front tire.
Two minutes. Proceed!
You have them?
Yes.
Help here, come on!
Hand me the tire
Faster. Come on.
Hold it here.
Get that wheel back on.
Hold on. Up with it.
Screw those nuts back in.
Ready sergeant.
Ready sergeant.
Good.
Lieutenant.
Do it again.
Do it in under one and a half minute
Under one and a half? Roger.
Good. Again, this time under one,
and a half minute. Proceed!
What are you waiting for?
Come on, Lassen.
Faster!
One and a half minute...
He must have drunk from the piss pot.
Kolding, you wan't more of that bread?
Yes, Justesen. I wan't it.
Are there room for more?
Chill out. You shall not roll home.
Funny how big you are you Copenhageners,
when you are many.
But when you are alone...
...you become quiet as mice.
How long do you think,
we will continue, Gram?
Till we can do it in one and
a half minute.
We have tried.
It's not going happen.
The sec. lieutenant just wan't
to see us work hard.
The wife probably didn't give him
what he wanted.
It's your officer, you are talking about.
He can't hear me.
Unless you are going to tell on me,
mr. room chairman.
Lieutenant, I have an important message
from the lieutenant colonel.
Stop the drill and return to the barracks.
After a meal they must go to bed
in preparedness.
What has happened?
There is new intelligence information.
A German convoy...
...are moving towards the border,
it's said to be kilometers long.
The lieutenant colonel doesn't
want to cause panic... -
...and therefore it has to be mentioned
as a part of the drill.
Sergeant Klostergaard, cancel the meal!
We ride to the barracks.
You heard the lieutenant!
Stand up! Go to the bikes!
Stand at attention!
After this you will all receive
Next you will go to your rooms
and go to bed in preparedness.
You need to keep on the uniforms and boots.
The equipment has to be ready.
And from now on you have to wear
your dog tag at all times.
Turn right!
Initiate!
Do you still think it's
just a drill, Gram?
They deserve to know what's going on.
Yes. But it's not our decision to make,
second lieutenant.
Received.
Have the Germans crossed the border?
How many are they?
How many are we speaking of?
They must stay put,
till they get new orders.
Border station 3, stay put.
Stay calm and wait for new orders.
Padborg, Kruså and now Rens.
There are any longer no doubt
about what's happening.
Give me the chief
for the Jutland division again.
Haderslev and Sønderborg
are also in a state of alert.
They are awaiting clearance
to leave the barracks.
They are 50 kilometers away.
The first hour depends on us.
Lieutenant colonel?
The chief for the Jutland Division.
Cut the speaker.
Major general? We have clear indication
about increasing troop activity.
Requesting to send my troops
towards the border.
And let them go in defensive positions.
I'm aware of that major general,
but we are 10 kilometers from the border.
If we wait till the border is crossed,
we won't have time to go into position.
Have the General Staff tried to talk
some sense to the minister?
Regarding the latest escalation
in consideration...
Yes sir, major general.
We will do our best.
So far, no news. We stay on high alert
at the moment.
It's the prime minister evaluation,
that any Danish mobilization...
...can be seen as a confrontation and
worsen the situation.
Defensive maneuvers are a provocation?
And the German mobilization is not?
Lieutenant, if you have a problem with
the order, keep it to yourself.
Men. Make sure your troops are
ready to go.
Yes sir, lieutenant colonel.
Sergent Klostergaard.
Yes sir.
Inspection of the sleeping hall.
Yes sir.
Shouldn't we already be in
defensive positions?
Yes. For that you can thank the
prime minister that we are not.
Can I see the picture?
Can I have it back?
Yes yes. Take it easy
There are not much we can do.
It's not everyone who shoot that well.
Come.
Hey Lassen. Getting any sleep?
Not so much.
Are you nervous, Lassen?
Yes.
It's not everyday you get
ammunition like this.
No it's not.
Can we have some of yours?
It's not for me. I have the machine gun.
It's for Lundgren.
I don't think,
we are allowed to do that, Andersen.
Lassen, you aren't exactly
the best shot here, right?
But Lundgren... We know what he
can do with a riffle.
Just half.
Exactly. 20 rounds.
It's for all our sakes.
Ok.
Good.
Lassen, don't.
Don't do it.
We have received 40 rounds each.
No one should get more or less.
And you two should be in bed.
Yes sir, room chairman.
Lassen, I mean it.
Gram, it's okay.
It's fine by me.
Yeah, what's the problem?
It's not your decision to make,
and you know it.
Gram, don't you want to win?
Of course I want to win.
You are German, right? Maybe you are
not interested in a victory?
I'm proud to be able to
call myself Danish.
But you are not.
That's exactly what I am.
Your dad is German, correct?
Yeah.
Then you're German.
You are more stupid than I thought.
It's not a game.
Shouldn't we save some
strength over there?
Go back to sleep.
It's pretty hard when you're jabbering.
Nobody spoke to you, Justesen.
I mean it, Andersen.
Lay down, right now.
Or what?
Just go lay down in your bed.
What's going on here?
Attention!
You should have gone to bed prepared!
Then you look like this! I have other shit
to do, than keeping my eyes on you!
How hard is it to button a jacket?
You have buttoned it wrong!
responsibility. Keep it together!
Sergent, yes sir!
Get those jackets buttoned.
Two minutes, then this hall
is totally quiet!
Proceed!
You need a light sec. lieutenant?
Looks like I do.
Are your men sleeping?
They are trying.
It's hard in full uniform.
I thought that order were
meant for everyone.
Except officers.
You are Bundgaard?
Yes.
It's my understanding that we
are supporting your platoon.
If the border is crossed.
When it gets crossed.
We are most likely the first to meet them.
Somebody is going to do it.
Can I?
Of course.
Then, eh... Pedal extra fast down there.
We're going to need you.
We'll be there.
We are faster than you think.
Keep the matches.
Thanks.
Sergent Bundgaard.
Second lieutenant.
If the Germans wanted to attack,
they'd had already done so.
There are somebody who are
negotiating as we speak.
Neither party wants a conflict.
Something is happening in the radio room.
Border station 3, come again. Repeat.
What can You see?
Have the Germans crossed the border?
Border station 3.
Border station 3, repeat message.
Border station 3, come in.
You heard it yourselves.
The enemy has crossed the border.
Denmark is at war.
Gentlemen. Now is the time to
show what we are made of.
Alarm! Raise the alarm. Come on!
To the bikes! Hurry up!
Here you go, Kolding.
Prepare to take off!
Sergent, yes sir!
Next.
Second lieutenant. 219, 4th company,
Next.
Second lieutenant. 223, 4th company,
Next man.
Helper.
Next.
Yes sir.
Ready?
Yes sir!
Sergent, yes sir!
Get that weapon higher up.
Sergent, yes sir!
The Germans have broken through 3 places.
One of them is Kruså
They are heading straight towards
us on highway 10.
If we hold it, it'll be hard
for the them to go north.
Any reports?
Haderslev and Sønderborg
should be on their way.
We need to stop the advancement
till reinforcements arrive.
When that happens we push them back.
Sønder Hostrup. New orders and
reports comes form here.
We meet up at Lundtoftebjerg.
You have to make stand meanwhile.
We will do our best lieutenant.
Lieutenant.
Attention!
Platoon ready for take off.
Roger, sergeant.
A German armor division have
crossed the border!
This is not a drill!
Denmark is at war!
Fight well!
Platoon, follow me!
Platoon! Get ready to mount up!
Mount up!
Faster!
Stop!
Stop! Dismount!
Be ready!
It's the motorcycle platoon.
Maybe it's over with?
I don't think so.
Stop!
Lieutenant, we only just
made it into positions.
We stopped a couple of armors.
We also got some infantry.
But it was too much.
How many are they?
One or two motorized companies
with assisting armor.
We are going north to setup
proper defense.
We got to hold Lundtoftebjerg.
Lundtoftebjerg has fallen.
Then we got to set up here. The terrain
is too open, come with us.
We need to hold Lundtoftebjerg till
Haderslev and Sønderborg gets here.
You haven't seen what's up ahead.
You can do what you want.
I will follow my orders.
There is no time for this.
Sand.
You have to talk to him.
I'm with him.
Take care second lieutenant.
Motorcycle platoon, we will continue.
What's happening?
Sergent Klostergaard!
Yes sir!
The machine guns are our best
chance against their armor.
We can split them in three and
catch them in crossfire.
How long till the reinforcements arrives?
At least 20 minutes.
Good.
Sand, get first squad in the tree line.
I'll take second squad down the gutter.
Third squad, on the hill. Machine gunners,
wait for my signal.
The carbines only shoot when
they see infantry getting close.
Yes sir!
Proceed!
First squad on me! Second squad wait
for the lieutenants orders!
Third squad, on me!
Second squad!
Go 50 meters that way!
We take position here, 225!
Roger!
Here.
Nice place, 219.
We wait for the lieutenants orders.
Short, controlled bursts
against their armor.
Roger, second lieutenant.
Where did the motorcycle platoon go?
I need your full attention
on that road there.
Yes sir!
I am so hungry. I haven't even
gotten my coffee today
Is that all you think about?
I mean it, Gram.
I don't function without my
first cup of coffee.
You and your coffee.
that shoots at the given signal.
The rest of you wait till
the infantry shows.
There is headwind.
It's sunrise.
Great conditions for hunting.
Shh, Kolding.
Wait.
Get down more, 225.
Roger.
Ready.
Ready
Open fire!
Open fire!
Andersen, they are ricocheting!
I know!
I need a new mag!
Open fire!
I'm reloading!
They are going for the machine gun!
You too, 212!
Two armored vehicles to the
right of the road!
Roger that!
Need a new mag!
Come on, 233!
On it, sec. lieutenant!
I'm reloading!
Yes sir!
Second lieutenant, help us!
I'm pulling back!
We are pulling back!
Come on! Get back!
You hit it!
Hell, I got it!
Shoot them! Shoot them!
Shoot them, Kolding!
Kolding, get down!
Nørreskov, help him!
Is it bad?
Yeah, it's bad!
We need help!
Nørreskov!
We are pulling back!
We got to get him away from here.
Kolding.
Second lieutenant, we got to go!
Kolding, look at me.
Do it now, take those bags!
There is nothing more to do here!
We can't do anything else! Come on!
Leave the tripod!
Come on!
Andersen,
where is Kolding?
Where is Kolding?
Come on, follow me!
Where is Kolding?
Control yourself!
Tell me, where is he?
Kolding is dead! Follow me! Get moving!
Come on!
Get moving.
Nørreskov!
This way!
Down to the farm house there.
Yes sir.
Come on. Move it.
Come on, 212.
Get in.
Roger.
Give me that weapon.
Get your shit together,
so we can get out alive.
Here! If you sees anything...
What are you doing?
No!
Relax! Relax!
Get down on the floor ma'am, now! Down!
O...h no.
Ma'am, stay calm.
We are not here very long.
Okay.
I can't see anyone.
Still nothing?
No.
I don't think anyone will come.
Sorry ma'am, do you have a place where the
soldier can get some water in his face?
Yes. This way.
This one?
Yes.
Follow me.
We will go north.
Up to Sønder Hostrup.
Get hold of the lieutenant colonel.
There is the command center.
There we can get new orders.
So we continue?
What else do you think, 233?
Nothing second lieutenant.
I'm ready.
I need a second in command.
That is you.
Come here.
There. Now you good to go.
Sweet boy.
There.
We are moving out.
We'll countinue.
Yes sir. Gentlemen.
Ma'am.
You can hide here.
You can have the hayloft.
Nobody will find you there.
And how would that help?
It would save the young boys life.
I'll protect the men with
everything I got.
I don't want to hide them,
as the war continues.
and now it's Denmark.
Maybe I should be ashamed, but it
never meant anything for me, really.
It means a lot for me.
Thank you for your help.
Attention!
I don't know what happened
to the lieutenant...
...sergeant Klostergaard
or the rest of the platoon.
We are, what's left. Now we know
what we're up against.
We have lost a good soldier today.
He fought, but succumbed to gods will.
Let his death be a lesson to us all.
We all have to be alert.
After me.
Stop!
The rest, wait here.
There is still no contact.
Lieutenant colonel.
Second lieutenant.
Sønder Hostrup calling. Come in.
Come in. Can you hear me?
I repeat.
Sønder Hostrup here. Come in.
You were at Lundtoftebjerg?
Yes. We didn't hold the position so long.
They were too many. We were attacked
by both armor and infantry.
Where is your lieutenant?
I'm not sure.
I think,
the lieutenant was captured -
Or surrendered with the
rest of the platoon.
What about the motorcycle platoon?
Sergent Bundgaard moved north
to new a new position.
But we are not defeated.
We are ready for the next order.
Get the radio up in the truck.
Move it!
Are you leaving?
Walk with me.
Thank you.
Cigarette?
Yes, please.
We have information from
Haderslev and Sønderborg.
They are not coming, sec. lieutenant.
There will be no reinforcements?
But why?
They said that they could do
more where they were.
It was the last thing we heard before
all communications stopped.
The telephone lines have most likely
been sabotaged by the enemy.
What about the joint defensive line?
It's not going to happen down here.
The border areas are lost.
All units have pulled back...
...or surrendered, so the battle will
be moved further north.
Any news from Copenhagen?
No. We have no contact with them.
So what are your orders then,
lieutenant colonel?
We pull back to Haderslev,
and join the garrison.
Then there will be created a
new defensive line there.
It's going to be a long day, Sand.
Lieutenant colonel.
Second lieutenant.
Attention!
There are some news.
The reinforcements from
Haderslev aren't coming.
And not from Sønderborg either.
We need to get to Haderslev.
And assist the garrison in
protection of the town.
May I ask a question?
No, 233, you may not. We take a
shortcut through the forest.
We should reach Haderslev before the
Germans. Understood?
Roger, second lieutenant.
Follow me.
Second lieutenant?
Yes, 212.
I have a flat back tire.
We do a short stop here.
Yes, second lieutenant.
The fastest way to Haderslev?
I want to stay off the main road.
And I don't want to be in the open.
What are you thinking?
If we continue the way we are
going to hit this road...
...and then we go through Aabenraa.
And from there, we can go
straight to Haderslev.
It should be doable.
Good, that's what we'll do.
Second lieutenant?
Yes.
They... he was a dear friend.
Make sure they hurry up.
Yes, second lieutenant.
You have to hurry up with that.
Proceed.
Did You have a great leave?
Yes, second lieutenant.
Do You have family?
I'm engaged.
Was that letter to her?
Yes.
Is the date set?
Not yet,
but hopefully this summer.
Then we must get You home again.
Nørreskov, You are a part
of 4th company, 2nd bicycle platoon.
You are not alone.
Received.
And the last bit. Come on.
We're almost there.
Do it faster.
Come on.
Give us a some more time.
I have no more time to give You.
The war is not waiting for You.
I can't do it any faster.
You have to.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Get going.
What?
What's the problem?
I'm trying...
Are you in any doubt?
No.
Have you forgotten your job?
No.
No, second lieutenant.
Then finish up that bike.
Yes sir.
Never discuss an order.
Yes, second lieutenant.
Ready, second lieutenant.
We'll continue. 233, 223.
Can you lend a hand?
Follow me.
You stay here.
Yes sir.
Hello. Do you want to buy some cheap milk?
Only two kroner.
Hey, what are you doing here?
What to buy some cheap milk?
Only two kroner.
Sergent Bundgaard.
Yes.
What's going on?
Second lieutenant.
The plan was to set up positions here,
but the locals are flocking the area.
They refuse to leave.
How did Lundtoftebjerg go?
We didn't hold it very long.
Any losses?
One man. Kolding.
No reinforcements are coming.
Neither Haderslev or Sønderborg?
No.
What's the orders?
We set up defense in Haderslev.
A defensive line so far
inland has no effect.
That's the order.
I'm not sacrificing my
men in a pointless battle.
Gather your men and move to Haderslev.
Understood?
Are we clear?
Yes.
Can I see what You have there?
Yes.
How did You get this?
German planes dropped them all morning.
Second lieutenant. German planes
have dropped this all over this place.
"Oprop! To Danish soldiers and
the Danish people."
Requesting us, not to resist.
In Norwegian.
The Germans are coming!
The Germans are coming!
Get into positions!
Get of the road!
Get these children away from here!
Second lieutenant, what's the orders?
Faster!
Leave!
Lead people away now!
Go away!
Come on, god damn it!
Frederik!
Come on!
Frederik!
Frederik!
Run!
Let go! Frederik!
Run!
Armor!
Take cover!
Lassen, get her away!
Second lieutenant, what's the orders?
Bicycle platoon, we are pulling back!
Come on! We are pulling back!
Come on, come on, come on!
Who can ride a truck?
I can.
Yes sir.
Come on!
Get up, all of you!
Come on!
Get it up!
Get us of the main road.
Yes.
Planes, planes!
Pull in to the side.
We continue towards Haderslev.
If we go on Løgumklostervej,
we should be able to avoid the Germans.
Do it.
Do you know the area?
Born and raised in Haderslev.
So you are going home now?
Looks like it.
You did well today.
With all due respect. The military is
just something to finish quickly.
What do you want to do?
I want to be a merchant,
second lieutenant.
Merchant?
Merchant.
Find a cute girl,
get loads of children.
I like it simple.
If you like it simple, the military must
be something for you then.
I could have turned those bikes around
ten times while standing here.
Yeah, towards the Germans.
They are coming.
Then you better hurry.
The sideways are closed.
Bundgaard. Captain.
The captain won't let us in.
You are in our line of fire.
You can go around the city.
They can be here any time.
No one gets in from the south.
I have to speak to the colonel.
You can find him at the square.
You can speak to him,
when You have removed the vehicles.
I have information regarding
the German advance.
And I have my orders, second lieutenant.
You haven't been in combat yet?
Not yet, no.
I thought so.
We have lost men by the border
while waiting for you.
Cut us some slack.
Open up so the truck can fit through.
Thanks.
Go on.
We will help fortify the barracks.
We will announce our arrival
to the colonel.
A person was nice giving these to me.
You all deserve a smoking break.
Thanks.
Second lieutenant.
Get going!
...in Vojens, who heard it over
the radio, colonel.
Get off.
Keep it to Yourself.
Try get it verified.
All telephone lines are dead.
Find another telephone or a radio then.
Colonel Hartz? Second lieutenant Sand,
Lieutenant colonel Hintz asked me,
to report to you.
You've had a busy morning.
My apologies, that we couldn't help.
But we got ordered to stay
and protect the city.
Planes have dropped them
over Danish towns all morning.
I've seen it before, but it's just a piece
of paper, and nothing more.
The Germans will come with motorized
infantry and armored vehicles.
It's not a fair fight.
You know, how it is.
Orders are orders. Nielsen?
Colonel.
Lead Sand and his men to the
positions at the approaching road.
They need some assistance.
Roger, colonel.
One of my men have lost his weapon.
And we need ammunition.
Tend to that too.
God, king and fatherland.
The colonel have given us a new
position to hold. Drop your bags.
Andersen, you'll get a new weapon.
The rest gets new ammunition.
Weapon?
That's me.
Thanks.
Ammunition?
Share it between you.
Come on. Hurry up!
Follow me!
We have men in position here.
And we have men in position here.
Are there new orders we need to
know straight away. Follow me.
Please get off the road.
Get away from here!
The colonel asked us to assist you.
What weapon do You have?
Machine gun here,
But only riffles on the other.
We need two rifflemen over there.
Andersen, Nørreskov.
Take position there.
Andersen, you're in charge.
Take care.
Roger, second lieutenant.
Go into position.
Follow me!
What's happening?
The Germans are coming!
Get away from the window!
Come with!
Do you think there's time for this?
Return the cups.
Just one cup of coffee.
You have to do it fast then, Justesen.
I'll take over the command.
Gram, Lassen, there.
Gram up, Lassen down.
Justesen, take position by the door.
You take position there.
You take position at the corner there.
Lassen, you have to move further in.
I can see them here.
I have a clear sight from here.
Do as you are told, soldier.
Armor!
They are too close!
We are pulling back!
Take position there!
I'm pulling back! Cover me!
I'm covering!
Nørreskov, come!
We have to go, now!
Andersen, I'm covering you!
Andersen! Run! Run!
Run!
Make sure you're covering him!
Get in!
Shoot him!
Second lieutenant!
Andersen, Nørreskov, pull back!
Pull back! Back to a new position here!
Come on, cover them!
Now! Covering fire!
Get in here!
Hold them as long as You can!
Yes sir!
I'm out of ammunition!
Hit that machine gun!
Last three!
We need ammunition,
second lieutenant!
Here.
We are pulling back! Lassen!
Coming!
Run, Lassen!
Justesen, It's your turn. Get back!
Gram, cover Justesen
to the right side of the road.
Justesen! Justesen!
Lassen, You'll run out and get Justesen!
Gram, You have to cover us!
Cover us, Gram!
Get him out!
Soldiers, cover us!
Lassen, we have to go! Now!
Lassen, take him here!
Lassen! Come on!
We'll pull him back.
Put him here! Put him here!
Stop the bleeding!
Are you listening? Stop the bleeding!
Pull back! Behind me!
Come on!
Second lieutenant! Nørreskov!
What should we do now?
Gram, pull back!
Now! Now! Now!
Look at me. Breathe! Breathe!
Second lieutenant!
Second lieutenant, we are losing him!
We literally have no ammunition left!
Justesen, look at me.
Sec. lieutenant, what are we going to do?
Second lieutenant, what's the orders?
Second lieutenant, we need
better care for him here.
Look at me, Justesen.
Second lieutenant!
I don't want to die!
What are the orders, second lieutenant?
It's over.
It's over!
Drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons!
Drop those weapons!
Hands up!
How do you say
"don't shoot, we surrender"?
Hold up your hands.
Just keep those hands high up.
- Get behind me, soldiers.
Get behind me now. Get behind me.
Stand up, everybody.
Two and two, after me.
March!
Gram.
It isn't necessary.
I am Oberleutnant Becker
from the 170th infantry division.
Second lieutenant Sand.
You are in my custody, and will be
sent back to your barracks.
He want to know why we
kept fighting for so long.
I don't understand. What do you mean?
It have been an unnecessary waste of life.
Because our government had already
surrendered long time ago.
You didn't know?
No, I did not know that.
When did we surrender?
A couple of hours ago.
You are welcome to wide with
him back to the barracks.
No thanks, I would like
to go with my men.
Yes, it was both disappointing...
...and a relief, that it was over quickly.
Without that many fallen Danes.
We had to surrender.
We couldn't take on Germany.
Of course we didn't like it. That's for sure.
They shouldn't occupy our country.
You can't be proud of,
that you have killed people.
And that's what it's all about.
The more you kill, the
easier it gets to win.
I can't let stuff like that go,
because there were things...
...that were pretty tough. But...
...but there is nothing
to do about it.
Nothing to do about it. It was a
situation I went through.
My father knows all my comrades.
Then he said:
"This I will tell you.
I would rather have heard, or hear...
Frode had fallen, than
that You haven't fought."
You are alone and have neither
a girlfriend, wife or kids.
So if the worst were to happen...
...then it wouldn't be the
greatest of disasters.
From the top, they said:
It was not in vain.
But the price...
...it was high, for some.
