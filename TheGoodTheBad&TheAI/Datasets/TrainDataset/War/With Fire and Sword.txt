The year 1647
was a strange year.
Various signs
on earth and in the sky
foretold disasters
and events of great magnitude.
Clouds gathered
over the mighty Commonwealth:
Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine
united under the rule of Wladislaw IV
Polish nobles and magnates
enjoyed limitless privileges
to the growing discontent of the
Cossack community, the Sietch.
Meanwhile the Crimean Tartars
started to threaten Europe...
Dead?
Alive, lieutenant.
It's someone important.
Beautiful horse. It's ours?
- Rzêdzian!
- It's a trophy.
Water!
Set me free. I'll pay.
Thank God we were nearby.
- The rogues pretended
to be Tartars. - Of course.
- You know him?
- My neighbor's servant.
Thank you...
for saving me.
Am I dealing with a nobleman?
Yes. I'm Zenobius Abdank,
a colonel in the Cossack
regiment of prince Zas³awski.
John Skrzetuski, lieutenant
- at Prince Jeremy's service.
- He's a famous warrior.
Thank you.
What's the rush?
Duty calls.
I'm carrying orders.
It's a small world.
Perhaps...
I'll be able
to return this favor.
Do you know
whom you really saved?
I'm Bohdan Zenobius Chmielnicki.

To the memory of Walentyna,
my wife
Czapliñski will get Chmielnicki.
- He won't.
- He will.
- I'll bet a ducat.
- Two!
He'll get him and hang him.
Chmielnicki... Chmiel is hop.
Hop's good for beer.
And the beer here is cat's piss.
Pretty lass, fill my glass,
and while at this,
give me a big kiss!
And your best mead!
If it weren't for me, Chmielnicki
be slain by bandits.
Don't you know
about the arrest warrant
issued by the authorities?
- I've just come back from the
- Where did you see him?
- On the other bank of the Dnepr
- Jesus, he went to the Sietch.
Like many others.
He stole the King's letters
urging the Cossacks
to revolt against noblemen.
That might set Ukraine on fire.
- You think there'll be a rebell
- I'm sure of it.
You're Ruthenian, colonel.
The Cossacks respect you.
Go to the Sietch.
Half of my men run off
with Chmielnicki.
If it weren't for colonel Bohun,
they'd all have deserted.
Death awaits me...
not a hetman's baton.
Greetings to you!
Czapliñski, a rowdy wrangler,
Chmielnicki's greatest foe.
Do you have any news
of Chmielnicki?
They've hanged him, and if not,
they will do it soon.
Don't spill the wine.
- Will you get him?
- My men are waiting for him
in the steppe.
Don't spill the wine.
He avoided your pursuit
and went to the Sietch .
Impossible!
Sir John here saved him,
and slaughtered your bandits.
In spite of the warrant?
He hasn't heard of it.
I'll have you arrested
- and set in stocks!
- Smell this.
Guards!
Gentlemen!
He is leaving!
I could dress your wounds,
I'm an expert.
Silence!
Vivat Skrzetuski!
Thank you, gentlemen!
Let me offer you my services.
I'm Zag³oba,
bearer of the "Forehead" crest.
An infidel Turkish dog
shot me in the head,
when I went to the Holy Land.
You told me someone hit you
with a tankard.
A Turk shot me!
You're confusing two stories.
Your health!
Introduce me, please,
to the lieutenant.
All right!
This here is
- Sir Long Anus...
- Longinus!
- "Trouser Snatcher".
- "Hoodsnatcher"!
- From Doggyguts.
- Mouseyguts.
Whatever.
I wouldn't live
in anybody's guts.
It's a disgrace to stay there
and a shame to leave.
He's been buying me wine
for a week.
Weighty sword, heavy purse,
featherweight brain.
Here you go again, phooey!
Is it an executioner's sword?
No, a Teutonic one.
My ancestor's battle trophy.
You lift it with both hands?
With both, or with one...
May I?
- Who'll do it?
- We've tried!
Your turn.
I'll be damned!
A fine soldier for the Prince.
- You think he'd take me?
- He'd be happy to!
Two new skewers for his kitchen:
you and your sword!
My family
crest is "Hoodsnatcher".
In 1410, one of my ancestors
cut off three hooded
Teutonic heads with one blow.
- The King granted him the crest
- Strength runs in the family.
What good it is to me?
I promised St. Mary to remain chaste
until I, too,
cut off three heads
with one blow.
- But you haven't?
- No. Tough luck.
Two heads, quite often,
but never three.
I'm no Hoodsnatcher,
and Mr. Zag³oba is right to mock
I offer my grief to Jesus.
- And have you remained chaste?
- God sees my sorrow.
I'm in my prime, I'm wealthy,
and I'm still waiting for the ...
- And blood runs hot...
- If you need blood-letting...
Rzêdzian!
I'm an expert.
Chevaliers!
Help us, poor women.
My sons will arrive
after dusk,
and there are graves around.
You pledged chastity,
so carry the old one.
Oh, brother...
Thank you.
I'd go through fire
to hear such thanks.
Through fire?
Yesterday I wouldn't have
believed that.
How can I believe today?
God bless you. We're from Roz³og
I'm prince Kurcewicz's widow.
It's an honor
to help you and your daughter.
She's not mine,
but my late brother's-in-law.
Our house isn't far.
You won't refuse an invitation?
Go ahead, my precious!
Accept my services.
You're asking for misfortune.
God's will.
- Mother, the carts are coming.
- Those gentlemen helped us.
Meet my four sons
and their companion,
Bohun, a Cossack colonel.
Sons, prepare the house.
Let's go.
Greetings, mother.
How's the Princess?
I'm glad to see you.
You'll play the lute for us.
You've saddened.
Smile, please.
He's a terrible man.
I don't fear any Cossacks
or their entire Sietch.
Get away, Pole!
Bohun! Off you go!
He's a madman.
A wild thing he is,
but we love him dearly.
ROZ£OGI
The Kurcewicz family site
- Welcome to our humble abode.
- Make yourselves at home.
Welcome!
- Come in!
- If you please.
Welcome.
Boys...
You're looking for a fight
with that young nobleman?
If he touches her,
he'll see my sword!
Do you want to ruin us?
The Prince will avenge him,
banish us, take Helena.
Do you want to be slain?
He came, he'll leave.
As you wish.
Though my soul groans,
I'll be sweet as honey.
Feed the servants!
- To the war against the infidels
- A toast!
We'll roam in the Crimea.
You're still hungry for fame?
Bigger war, greater glory.
Sing us about the Cossack glory.
Whose horse is standing there,
Shaking its coal-black mane?
I am pining away
I am pining away
for a girl like a dream.
Stop tormenting the soul...
Musicians, play!
I've made a vow to the Virgin
that until
I cut off three heads...
You haven't vowed chastity?
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
Virgin of Virgins,
Let me be Sir John's wife.
Let him be my husband,
and save me from Bohun. Amen.
The girl stopped me
on my way here.
- Which girl was that?
- The Princess.
- Why didn't you tell me sooner?
- Jesus! You didn't ask.
Listen, you swain...
Don't call me that.
I'm of noble blood, though poor.
- I have my dignity.
- What did she say?
Who?
She asked
if your word was of any worth.
And?
I put it this way...
"If my master
promised me a horse,
I'd have no doubt it was mine".
Take the horse.
I heard rumors
they plan to give Helena
to Bohun.
What?
She owns Roz³ogi
and if Bohun marries her,
- he'll let the family stay here
- You've found out a lot.
If I found out A, without
finding out B, you'd say,
"No saddle for you".
Who needs a bare-backed horse?
Rzêdzian!
You cunning devil...
The horse and saddle are yours.
I humbly thank you, Sir.
Thank you for your hospitality.
- You're always most welcome.
- Always!
I'd like a word with you all...
in private.
In private? Go in.
Forgive me for acting
against the old custom.
But I have no choice.
I'm asking you
to let me marry Helena.
You and Helena?
Yes.
I beg your pardon,
but I've already promised her
- to another.
- To Bohun?
So that he lets you stay here?
- That's nothing to you.
- You want to rob her!
The Prince will burn the place
and you'll rot in the dungeon.
I'll let you stay in Roz³ogi
and won't ask for rent.
Don't give away
what's not yours.
If you give me the girl
I'll appease the Prince's wrath.
You have my word of honor.
What say you, my sons,
to this officer's
humble request?
Tell us if we shall
kill or agree.
Bohun will seek revenge.
Make your choice.
- Secrecy is imperative.
- She's mine?
She is.
- You won't betray me?
- If we only could...
You didn't even bother
to ask her what she thinks.
Then let us ask her.
If it be your will,
here is your betrothed.
- Is that true?
- Like God in heaven.
£UBNIE
Prince Jeremy's family site
John!
I have missed you...
- so much!
- Likewise, Michael.
- The Prince kept asking about
- Rzêdzian! My outfit!
This is Sir Longinus,
alias the Hoodsnatcher,
whose strength has no match.
And that's Michael Wo³odyjowski,
swordsman extraordinaire.
- I still have scars from that
- Fewer than I.
What did you two fight for?
- A girl. All the ladies pine for
- Oh dear...
They'll have to pine for
another. I've fallen in love.
And I've proposed!
I'm glad you want to marry her.
She comes
from an old and noble family,
her father was a patriot.
You did well in the Crimea,
but now it all seems in vain.
There'll be no war with Turkey!
The King may dream about it,
but the Senators
won't let him have his will.
Expect a rebellion.
Chmielnicki's gone to the
Sietch ? I've seen him in combat.
It's been years since the
Cossacks have had such a leader.
I must send a spy there.
- When shall I leave?
- You've just arrived.
I'm ready to go.
- And visit the Princess on your
- Yes, Excellency.
Well...
You saved Chmielnicki's life.
Go. I'll give you letters
to some of the atamans. Find out
if Chmielnicki is allying with.
I'll be back in a month.
Don't you fret.
- A priest awaits us in £ubnie.
- I'm worried about you.
An envoy is untouchable.
Goodness me, master...
I've never seen so much water!
The Dneper.
What's wrong?
So much soil going to waste.
And my parents went to trial
for a pear-tree on the balk.
It all started 50 years ago.
Let's say this is the balk...
Why aren't there any boats?
I don't see any fishermen.
Must have run off
to the Sietch.
Hoist the sail!
Turn back!
Rzêdzian, go back to Roz³ogi.
- I won't leave you.
- That's an order.
Even if you killed me...
Go.
- Take a horse.
- Which horse?
You can take mine.
I'll give you letters.
Helena's family must go to
£ubnie, there's going to be war.
Goodness me!
Then I have to go.
I'll write the letters.
Watch out!
- Who are you?
- And you?
Answer or I'll shoot!
An envoy from Prince Jeremy
to the chief ataman.
- Where's the envoy?
- Here.
We'll escort you. Tied up.
THE COSSACK SIETCH
April 1648
A letter from Prince Jeremy
asking the chief ataman
to betray me.
And two letters instructing
Tatarchuk and Barabas
to meet the envoy's needs.
What do you say, gentlemen?
Could the chief ataman
hide the letters?
He could.
He could... but he didn't?
- So he's been loyal?
- Yes!
- And I trust him.
- Thank you, Bohdan.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Go and announce
that he's beyond suspicion.
The chief ataman
is no traitor!
If he hadn't betrayed us,
then who is the traitor?
Why did they write you?
I'm innocent!
Did I receive the letters? No!
And even if I had,
I'd take them to the scribe,
as I cannot read or write!
We were together in the Crimea,
I shed my blood for you...
Why does the Hetman
suspect me?
Tatarchuk's our brother!
Yes, our brother.
And a brother's betrayal
saddens my heart.
Why do the Poles write you?
Why do they tell you
to meet all the envoy's wishes?
The envoy will wish to know
if we're ready to rebel
and if the Tartars
are on our side.
Tatarchuk and Barabas
are traitors. Kill them.
Kill them!
Judas!
I know this Pole,
he was in the Crimea.
Who are you?
I'm an envoy to you, Ataman.
My men were slaughtered.
- Prince Jeremy will be enraged.
- Kill him!
Kill!
Death to him! Kill!
Silence!
Let us have him!
And kill!
Wait!
Quiet!
He's an envoy.
Understand? An envoy!
- A spy!
- Kill him!
Let us... or we'll take him.
Prince Jeremy will pay in gold.
Give him to us!
Away!
Infidel dogs!
Out of my sight!
You want to take my prisoner?
Never! You pig-eaters!
Go away!
Tuhay-bey is angry!
The Pole!
Quiet!
Tuhay-bey is angry!
He's angry!
He's very angry!
Hey, hey, Tuhay-bey...
How much ransom
are you expecting to get?
He's an important person.
The terrible Prince
loves his people. 2000 thalers.
I can pay you 2000.
- You will pay 3000.
- Why?
Because you want him.
He saved my life.
Then you'll give 4000.
I'll pay 4000.
I don't want his pity.
You don't know my plans for you.
When the war breaks,
money will be scarce. I can pay
here and now.
- 4000.
- It's a deal!
I'm sleepy.
- Show him to his chamber.
- Let's go.
We're even now. You're free
if you promise not to tell
what you've seen here.
I cannot.
Then I shall not let you go,
until I'm ready for war.
All this because some Pole
seduced your wife?
Silence!
Czapliñski killed my son.
Would people follow me,
if I only sought private revenge
Look at today's Ukraine.
Who's happy here?
A few magnates and noblemen.
Theirs is the land,
theirs is the freedom.
All the others? They're scum.
Have the Cossack army
been shown any gratitude
for fighting on Poland's side?
Where are our privileges?
The nobles want to turn
free Cossacks into serfs.
I declare war against them,
not against the King.
The King is our father,
and Poland is our mother.
Whom you sell to the Tartars.
Should we let ourselves
get butchered
like the rebels of the past?
The magnates
are killing our mother.
It's because of them Ukraine
won't join your alliance against
the Turks, Tartars, Muscovy.
Who gave you the right to be
our judge and executioner?
Let God judge and punish.
When we complained to the King,
he asked,
"Haven't you any guns
and sabers?"
The King of Kings would say,
"Forgive your foes, as I forgave."
I don't want war with Poland.
If she gives us back our rights,
I'll send the Tartars away.
The Poles are marching
against us!
War.
Pour us some good wine
into crystal goblets,
so that enemy bullets
so that enemy swords
don't pierce our hearts.
So that Ukraine
stops shedding bitter tears,
so that our glory,
so that Cossack fame,
lasts forever and ever.
They're preparing for a battle.
The Hetman orders you
to move forward.
YELLOW WATERS
April 29, 1648
Crooked Nose,
in the name of God.
Halt!
Brother Cossacks,
aim the guns!
Fire!
Lances forward!
Fire!
Where's my loot, my prisoners,
my victory?
Over there.
Your infidel dogs
don't want to fight.
- You've ruined the Khan's army!
- Calm down.
Tomorrow, after the rain,
- the hussars will drown in mud.
- You promised
victory, not defeat.
We've captured some dragoons.
They're yours.
I'll have them
impaled!
They'll draw the others
to our side.
Beat the drums.
Feign attack
and withdraw,
the whole night long.
Halt!
Fall back!
Fall back!
Rain for the Poles,
the sun for us.
It's time.
Don't despair, Bohun.
The magnates
have stifled the rebellion,
there'll be peace.
I'll give you my crest,
and the princes
will give you their sister.
We usually
take prisoners to the commander.
- But he's asleep.
- This guy's going to £ubnie.
- To £ubnie?
- Yes, Colonel.
Let him go.
Rzêdzian?
That's
John Skrzetuski's servant.
- Is your master well?
- Yes, he sends his regards.
I know him, too.
We met... in Roz³ogi.
Where?
- In Roz³ogi.
- At the Kurcewiczs'.
- Who?
- You've gone deaf?
I'm very sleepy...
Good bye.
Wait. You'll get your sleep.
- Search him!
- That's illegal!
Let him be.
Let him be.
"To the honorable...
princess Kurcewicz in Roz³ogi".
So, you're going to £ubnie?
You don't know where Roz³ogi is?
"To Helena Kurcewicz..."
- That's an offence.
- I have orders
to inspect the mail.
"My sweetest, beloved Helena...
Queen of my heart..."
Skrzetuski is your rival?
You're wooing the same girl?
Cheer up.
- Once, I...
- Silence!
Jesus...
A medic! Bohun!
I'll live.
Maxim!
Lower the bridge!
Wait for a shot.
Who's there?
Don't you recognize?
It's you... thank God!
Let us in.
Bohun, be reasonable,
your life is at stake.
To hell with my life!
Who could that be?
Bohun?
- You? Here?
- Aren't you glad to see me?
Very glad... and surprised.
You're supposed to be in Czehryñ
And who is your companion?
Mr. Zag³oba,
a noble
and my friend.
Please, sit. Eat and drink.
Thank you
for paying us a visit.
Is Helena well?
She is.
- I'd like to see her.
- She's gone to bed.
Pity. I won't be staying long.
I wanted to see you
before going to war.
It's hard to fight one's own.
But there's no choice.
I might not come back.
But I want you to assure me
that Helena
will be mine.
A nobleman's word obliges.
And you're nobility.
You're princes.
So...
Promise?
We have to ask her.
Let everyone speak
for themselves.
Promise?
We do.
We do.
We do.
Zag³oba...
Ask them, too.
They may give her to you.
Are you drunk?
Sir John Skrzetuski
sends you letters.
To arms!
Peace!
Back off!
Back!
Princess...
Surround the house.
Don't let anyone in...
I'll kill whoever enters!
Put him in bed!
I'll dress his wounds!
He needs to rest!
Off with you!
The cellar is yours.
But leave something for me.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners, now
and at the hour of our death.
Christ! Keep quiet!
Stop!
Sir John sends me.
- Why should I believe you?
- Have you a better choice?
Give me some mead!
- Do you see that?
- I'll be damned...
Not bad.
Too good
for your peasant throats.
Why don't you
share some with the guards?
Relieve them!
- Let them drink, too!
- Thank you, kind Sir.
Hey, you,
- is it far to £ubnie?
- Very far.
- Can I get there by dawn?
- No way!
By noon?
That's more like it.
Go ahead, boys!
Help yourselves!
Don't be shy!
The ataman's asleep!
Let him rest!
I'll keep watch over him.
And you all, drink his health!
To his health!
Feel better?
You can't talk?
That's even better.
You won't protest,
when I take Helena
to £ubnie.
I'll ask the Prince to send you
a doctor... or a hangman.
I can assure you
we two will never drink again.
Soldiers!
Quiet!
Quiet.
Get well.
Pity, I can't stab you.
We might meet again,
but I won't pray for that.
I'd sooner let myself get
stuffed and hung on the wall.
Slow down.
- This isn't the road to £ubnie.
- Tuck your hair in.
They think we went to £ubnie,
and we're heading for Czehryñ.
Son of a bitch!
That damned Pole!
I'll rip his throat open!
- He asked for the road to £ubnie
- To £ubnie!
- Take the goods!
- And if Jeremy comes?
Put the blame on Bohun!
Hide!
Ride off!
- Czehryñ fell!
- My God...
The serfs are butchering
the nobles! It's Judgment Day!
Don't go to Roz³ogi!
Chmielnicki before us,
Bohun behind us.
God will save us again.
There's a fortress called Bar.
But far from here.
Very far.
- I've seen nobody.
- Nobody?
No.
Go ahead.
I saw
Zag³oba and a lad...
- Where?
- Halfway to Czehryñ...
at a pond.
- You warned them?
- I did.
Hang him.
Let's go!
Might the dogs eat you!
Might they skin you! Might
the Jews wear you as collars!
- What wrong?
- No horses!
God be praised!
Now and ever after.
- Who's there?
- Christians.
- Where are you coming from?
- From Chmielnicki.
Have you seen him?
I'm...
I'm blind, Sir.
- And the boy?
- He saw him.
But he's deaf.
I'm the only one
who understands him.
You dirty spies!
You incite the serfs to revolt?
Strip them naked, soldiers!
And hang them!
Strip!
Give me that! Quick!
Or I'll kill you!
Sons of bitches! Drunkards!
Trousers, quick!
You're as good as dead.
Take them!
My God! Jeremy's soldiers!
That's the Prince!
Get them!
Go!
They'll kill us!
Fire!
Kill!
Viper!
Princess...
Hands off!
Give me a quart of vodka.
A doctor!
A doctor!
He was a Jew,
so they hanged him.
But I'm an expert.
Bohun!
Bar!
God be praised!
We're here, my little one!
And where did you come from?
- Why are you here?
- Me? I'm doctoring you.
You've lost much blood.
You were with me all the time?
No one else knows the cures.
You're Skrzetuski's servant.
I'm nobody's servant anymore.
I joined the Cossacks.
I'll make you well.
And as for that...
no hard feelings.
I know you're hot-tempered.
You witch...
how come you're here?
I saw you needed help.
Get up, war!
You're his doctor?
Good. Get out!
Leave.
Your girl
is in the castle
on the white rock
- over the water.
- You're sure?
I saw her.
KORSUÑ, May 26, 1648 the second
defeat of the Polish troops
Glory, brother Cossacks!
You'll be escorted by Tartars,
as the Prince likes impaling cossacks
- You're free.
- No!
I'm letting you go,
though you'll fight against us.
If God gives me the strength.
To our fame and good luck!
Away with misery!
Kiss my hand!
Why?
Because I'm His Excellency!
His Highness!
Call me "magnate"!
Because I'm drinking
from a magnate's goblet!
- What?
- That is
a chamber pot, you moron!
For drinking
- in a chamber?
- It was used
for pissing
and shitting!
- That's a lie!
- I never lie!
Even dogs shit outside!
Quiet! It's our Hetman!
Brother Atamans,
I bring sorrowful news.
Our protector and benefactor
King Wladislav IV
is dead.
Let's decide, if we shall wait,
until we gather our forces, or..
Let's attack Jeremy!
He's our enemy!
Let's fight!
- Kill Jeremy!
- Impale him!
Tuhay-bey has gone
to the Crimea.
He'll be back in a month. Should
we go without the Tartars?
To kill Jeremy!
Let's write we do not want war,
but respect for our rights.
A letter!
Quiet!
And who will deliver it?
Who's the bravest?
Who shouted,
"Let's fight Jeremy"?
I'll go.
What shall we write him?
- "You son of a bitch"!
- "You devil's offspring"!
- "You tyrant".
- That's good.
Very good.
But we shall write him this.
"Your Enlightened Excellency,
Prince and Governor".
"Therefore I'm asking you
to forgive us for what we did
with the commanders
who attacked our forces.
Bohdan Chmielnicki,
the Cossack Hetman".
Arrest them.
We're the Hetman's envoys!
The rebel's envoys.
- We're envoys!
- It's an outrage!
Remember that Chmielnicki
let Skrzetuski go.
Skrzetuski was my envoy.
You're comparing me to a rebel?
Let them feel they're dying.
What do you make of that letter?
He's a sly fox, Your Excellency.
He's waiting for the Tartars
to return from the Crimea.
- We should move.
- And such is my will.
But we mustn't
underestimate Chmielnicki.
Potocki wanted
to strife the rebellion.
They killed his son
and took him prisoner.
We're alone.
No one will help us.
Chaos reigns after
the King's death. Bychowiec!
- Yes, Sir!
- Take 300 dragoons.
Escort my wife, the nobles
and the Jews to Zamoæ.
And hurry back.
Where to?
You'll find us. We shall
make ourselves known in Ukraine.
I, Jeremy Winiowiecki,
Ruthenian Governor,
Prince of £ubnie and Winiowiec,
do solemnly pledge,
before you, God in Trinity,
and before you, Virgin Mary,
that having raised my sword
against the roguery, I shall not
until I pacify all of Ukraine,
and drown all peasant rebellions
in blood.
So help me God.
Amen.
Curse...
on you...
Poles...
God in Heaven...
Skrzetuski!
John?
Do you recognize me?
John!
Christ...
he's gone insane.
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name,
Thy Kingdom come,
Thy will be done...
Thy will be done...
Thy will be done...
on earth...
as it is in Heaven.
Sir Michael!
Take him on a scout.
Let the wind
blow his woe away.
Search the village.
If you find stolen goods,
chase away the women and children
burn the house... and thank the
peasants...
- Marauders ahead of us.
- Let's go.
I'm a nobleman!
Stop!
Sons of bitches!
Don't you dare!
Zag³oba?
Lord be praised!
Mr. Zag³oba! He's alive!
Our dearest friend!
Let go!
Don't break my bones! So much
muscle and so little brain!
Here you go again. Phooey!
I'm thirsty.
Why are you here?
God's will.
The Princess asked me
- to find him.
- Who?
The Princess.
What?
She's alive?
She is, but let go
before you shake my soul out.
- Is she all right?
- A dry throat can't be choosy.
I'm talking about Helena!
She's safe in Bar.
It's a mighty fortress.
Thank you... with all my heart.
God favors you, John.
Bar is ahead of us.
Horpyna!
Horpyna!
I was expecting you.
And is that your stud?
My dog.
You devil!
- Can I trust them?
- Totally.
What's that?
This?
Unwelcome guests.
