My Hatice
Hürrem, welcome
What are you talking about?
How will you take Hürrem's life?
As long as you want it my Sultana
I will find a way
Don't interfere in things you can't do
I don't want it
Do you understand?
My Sultana...
Enough, shut up!
My pain is enough for me
I don't want you to cause me more troubles
I hope it is good
Very good news, my Majesty
I wanted to tell you the good news myself
I'm pregnant again
Prince is on the way
My Hürrem
You make me happy, I hope God will make you too
Alexandra
Leo, Leo!
Do you wish to die, man?
My Majesty, please accept my congratulations
Thanks, İbrahim
I hope God will grant you and Hatice fortunate children too
I hope God will grant us a son
I hope so, Hürrem
Daye, keep an eye on Mahidevran
She should be miserable now
She shouldn't do anything mad
Don't you worry my Sultana
I'll take care of it
My Sultana
Forgive me,  I'd like to tell you something
Did something happen? What is it? Tell me
My Sultana...
I'm very sad
You are a supreme Sultana
It is very hard to be leaving your service
Thanks to you
Don't be sad, Sadıka
I'm glad to have you
I'm very glad of your respect and care
But I'm also happy that you are going with Hatice Sultana
I won't have to be worried
I'm sure you'll serve my Hatice well too
My Majesty, should they be waiting for the painting?
No, they can come later
Who are they?
Ibrahim met a talented artist. He wants me to be portraited
He'll hang it in his palace
How nice
Perhaps he can paint us together, can't he?
Let's see
How will he paint my portrait
Let's see it first
My Majesty is busy with his harem
Leave now, you'll come later
What happened to you? You are pale
I worked hard last night
I didn't sleep
Okay then, go get some rest
Come on Matrakçı
Pack your stuff
Who are these women?
They came the day before
One of them is Hatice Sultana
She's the sister of our Majesty and future wife of Our İbrahim Paşa
The other one is Hürrem Sultana
Hürrem?
Oh she's from your country. She's from Crimea
She's daughter of a priest
And now she's the woman of supreme Sultan Süleyman
Beared him two children
The third one is on the way
I can't wait anymore. I can't sleep anymore
Easy, they'll hear us
Not much left to rejoin
Our wedding will be magnificent my Sultana
The day you've been waiting for's arrived, my Sultana
The day you've been dreaming of
See,
What they are doing for you
All the city is entertaining
My lion cub, you want to come too ?
Yes, father
I get very bored among women
Don't ever say it near women
It is evening, the party has started
İbrahim promised to take me
Okay my Mustafa, I just have a little work left. Let me finish and we'll go
This meeting is like a gift for me
I didn't think I'd see you
I couldn't go without seeing you the last time, without kissing your blessed hands
I'll leave this palace in a while
But this seperation will be the last parting
I'll be watching our wedding from a distance
I'll loko at you afar
You won't be able to see me
But please feel me
I'll always be near you
You should know too,
That I won't be breathing until the night we lay our head on the same pillow
Listen to my heart
Hear it
It is beating for me
It says...
... the happiness is here
It is very soon
I need to go, my Sultana
Paşas are waiting for me at the first court
Farewell
My love
My soul
Farewell, my love
Paşa his Lordship
Farewell to you
I hope you'll be happy forever
May God bless you, Nigar Kalfa
What a talent
Welcome, sirrah. Welcome
I'm honored Master Nasuh
Thank you, I'm praying to God that I'm seeing this happy day
It is the single ones' turn now
What?
Don't look at me like that. I'm fine like this
I thought I was fine too but then I fell in the fire of a sea  eyed beauty
Long live our Emperor
They are comming
Long live our Emperor, long live Our Emperor, long live our Emperor
Şehzade Mustafa, Nazar değmesin kaşa
Prince Mustafa, God save you
Do you see Mustafa? They love you very much
I love them very much too
Prince Mustafa, God save you
Attention
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Excellence
My emperor
We have reached this supreme honor because of you
You are at my son İbrahim's wedding
How can we tell our happiness with my son Niko...
I'm very glad, welcome
Are you happy with your family?
My Emperor
How can I say this...
We are fishermen
Forgive us if there is a mistake,
Our prayers are for you,
For your family
When I look at you I want to call you "Pargalı"
Having a twin brother is a grace of Allah, appreciate it
Your brother is very important to me
My Majesty
We have been neglecting the painting since a while
But we will continue after the wedding
You'll paint me more portraits
As you wish my Majesty
Are you done with your works here?
Only a little left, my Majesty
Good
Hürrem?
Don't be afraid
It was a little pain
Baby just poked me
It is nothing
What's this face?
You're the Sultana's bridemaid
You should be working like a bee, don't stop
I'll be leaving the palace, I'm very sad
I would be favourite and bear princes as Hürrem Hatun
Don't think about these anymore
There's no good in being rebellious against fate
I'll not see Majesty again
Who said that?
You'll see him
Our İbrahim Paşa is the closest one to our Majesty
He'll be going to his palace
Will he be?
He would but...
Don't you daydream
Mind your business now
What is it? Are you okay?
My son never stops
He's kicking a lot
It gave a hard time to the mother last night too
A prince worthy of world is comming Iguess
Come on, it is a big day
Bridal procession will start
How many days has it been?
When will the wedding end?
Are you bored of the wedding?
No
But I don't get to see you
That's enough
Be near me
Süleyman, you are leaving again
It is very beautiful, is not it?
Will my Hatice like it? What do you think?
You can gift it to me if she doesn't like
I'm in love with that necklace
You are my the most precious jewellery
My Hatice, my Janoesque daughter
You're married now
You are married to the Grand Vizier İbrahim Paşa now
May God make you happy for all life long
My mother...
It's my last day at my home today
Please don't deprive me from your caressing laps
Attention
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Excellence
My Hatice
My precious sister
I made a promise to you
Today is the day I'm keeping my promise
Seeing your happiness fills my heart with joy
My Majesty
As long as I breathe...
...I'll not take this necklace off
I've solemnized your marriage with Sultan Süleyman's sister ,Hatice Sultana, in the presence of groomsman, Ayaz Paşa and  our Hatice Sultana's assignee, Mustafa Paşa
May Allah make you happy forever
I hope it will be blessed
It if not worthy of you but...
I'll be happy if you accept
Perhaps you'll go fishing again
And your wires will need a repair
You'd remember me
Father...
Father
Your presence, you being near me is the biggest happiness for me
This...
This will always make me feel who I really am
I'll always keep it with me with honor. It will be my luck
It has been 9 days
How many more days will the wedding last?
It is İbrahim Paşa's call
Only the bridal procession will leave the palace today
Golds are raining to the soil
Thousands of hungry people were fed here
God give blessings
You can't splurge the states' golds like that
The treasury would be empty
Our emperor would have one more campaign and fulfill the treasury
They can't leave the party and battle
Shut up you shameless'
Was it your father conquering Rhosed and Belgrad?!
You ate and drank. Instead of praying you are gossiping about our Majesty
Look at your belly
You are shameless
Where did you grow this belly?
What?!
Are you hearing what you are saying?
Shameless insolent
Accursed
Nothing should be given to you
Let me go
Impolite!
Gülfem
My legs are shaking
Don't leave me
My Sultana just a little bit left
Your happiness is waiting for you
Ah, what a beautiful day
Everyone is happy and joyful
Is not it, my Sultana?
Hürrem Hatun
It is not what you are really thinking
You are fake
Everyone knows that
You can't trap me
I know you well
Get along well with me, my Sultana. Because it would be for your goodness
Err..Bride.. procession. From where will they be comming?
Look, they'll come from this way
They'll be passing through here
Just wait
Okay, thank you
Ottoman hasn't seen such a wedding
Right, but, They are wasting everything we earnt in Rhodes battle
For who? For accepted İbrahim Paşa
Not one day, not even two
Folks are entertained since 9 days
They say it will continue
Hürrem, are you okay?
Calm down
It has been like this
It is alright
There's still time left for my prince's birth
Don't say so
You've been saying the same last time
You were the sad one in the end
I have to. It has to be a son
Mahidevran has a single son
I should have two
Gülnihal...
Pray
I wish you happiness İbrahim Paşa
I wanted to introduce you wedding gift today, but
The ship comming from Venice is late
Also, I'd like to say you the congratulations wishes of Venice Doge
Thank you
Also thank you for your gift too
I'm ashamed
In a few days your dinner set will be arriving
Enjoy your dinner set
I'd like to have friendship dinners with you on that table
Attention
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Excellence
My Majesty
What does Venetian ask for again?
He could ask for inappropriate things in your happy wedding day
They's here for congratulating, my Majesty
They handed me the Venetian Doge's congratulation letter
Good
Wish you always wear it in good days
My Majesty
I'm grateful for your great gift
Alex
Come on, come
Where are you my love?
Hatice Sultana is very fortunate
She's marrying with such a wedding
I'll never experience something like this
But my daughter Mihrimah will
İbrahim and Mahidevran won't be in the palace
They'll dissapear
The prince is comming!
Stop thecarriage. My Sultana is giving a birth
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Excellence
I'm honored to be at this beautiful wedding for Venetian Republic
Please accept our congratulations
This clock is specially made for you ordered by the Venetian Doge
The time will be passing through your ears when you look at it
Deliver my thanks to him
But I can't waste time by looking at it
I'd like to be running before the time
Hold on Hürrem
Is not there anybody? Call the physician
Where's the midwife?!
Hürrem, hold on.
Is there anybody?
Hatice, come near me
Beyhan, Gülfem
Mahidevran, you too
Where's Hürrem, Daye?
She was right behind us, my Sultana
Nigar Kalfa?
I didn't see her, I don't know
They must be stuck in the crowd
Take care of them
Hürrem Sultan's carriage went back to the palace
How can it be? Who told you that?
I have nothing to do with it
Nigar Kalfa, have a look immediately
Find out what happened urgently and inform me
I've called the midwife Hürrem, hold on. She's comming
Help me
Keep breathing, she'll be here
Süleyman, where are you?
There is nobody
My Majesty
Accept my thankfullness for this magnificent wedding
Pargalı, You've been waiting for this happiness
On one side, my the most precious treasure Hatice
On the other side, my bosom friend who saved my life many times
It is not even enough
Dad
I haven't seen Mehmet. He's not here yet
How come?
Sümbül!
My Majesty
Why didn't Hürrem Hatun come here?
I'll get an information immediately my Majesty, don't you worry
My Valide Sultana
Wagoner just came,  her labor's started. Therefore they had to go back
Have her taken care of right now, She shouldn't be alone
Nigar Kalfa went there, she'll be taking care of the situation, my Sultana
God, you are merciful, help us
She shall bear a girl
I hope she'll die during the labor!
My Sultanas tears may have an end
Hold on, hold on
Hürrem Sultan?
Nigar Kalfa! Noone would know even if I die. Where have you been?!
My Sultana, come on, one last push
Push it, come on
Say it
Tell me
Is it a son?
Gülnihal?
Nigar?
My Sultana, You've beared a lion
Thank you God
The beauty with...
...Beautiful eyebrows and and thin waist
May Nasuh be sacrificed for you
Was that you?
You scared me
Move, move, they shouldn't see us
Walk, walk
Daye?
Give us a good news at this happy day
Is it over yet?
My Sultana...
We have got one more prince
God, you are great
You've granted me double happiness in a single day
Nigar, give me my son
My Sultana
You got the prince in the end
You trust me by now
Pargalı

All my subjects should learn about my prince's good news. Fire the cannons!
My Majesty, our happiness is doubled now

İbrahim Paşa will be here in a while
I should go
Don't leave yet, Gülfem
Stay a little bit more
You've been waiting for this moment since a long time
Relax
It is time to...
... make yourself and also the Paşa happy
Our Valide Sultana is inviting you to the naming ceramony of our prince
Will you go?
Is not it a pity for you?
Will you be obligated to go see that woman?
We need to do the traditions in the palace
I need to play the game within it's rules
I'll go, Gülşah
Good night, my Paşa
Gülfem Hatun...
Thank you very much
If we made it to this night, your share in it is big
I can never pay it back
Take good care of our Sultana
Never make her sad
Don't break my heart
Make her happy
You can pay it back only this way
Don't worry at all, Gülfem Hatun
God bless him. I hope he'll grow up healthy, my Majesty
Thank you Mahidevran Sultana
I'll name my Prince my deceased father's name
Shall he be a majestic emperor as Sultan Selim Khan

Selim.. Selim.. Selim
Selim, Selim, Selim
In the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful
May God make him righteous
Amen
May Allah make him happy
Amen
I hope Allah save him for the Ottoman Empire
Amen
Never-seen-before entertainments have been organised for 15 days
İstanbul  ...
enjoyed in the streets without sleep
İbrahim Paşa is not only The Grand Vizier now
He's a dynasty groom now too
He's got very powerful
The palace opened it's gates for the first time to the people with this wedding
Though people enjoyed the wedding,
On the other side,
The folks had the hump because of the weddings length and the money waster
Especially Sultan Süleyman's Janisaries  are unhappy with this situation
They believe the money gained from Rhodes campaign is being wasted
During the wedding, Sultan Süleyman got one more son
Born of Russian concubine, Hürrem Sultan
The baby was named Selim
Close relations should be built with İbrahim Paşa whose mother is Venetian
A Paşa who speaks our language and know our customs is a golden opportunity
Venetian Embassadors should be close and send gifts
Selim
The precious of his aunt
I'll eat those delicious cheeks of yours
My dear
How sweet you are
It is fortunate you are here
I wanted very much but couldn't be with you at your wedding
If you want it very much, it doesn't get real. I learnt it
How have you been? Are you better now?
I just got up from the bed
I've been bored, laying since days
I want to go to the yard and walk, breath fresh air
It is like we are prisoners in this chamber
How nice
Who gifted this?
Mahidevran Sultana's gift
How beautiful
You should be like this
Live in peace
I don't want to be worried about you
We've found the peace
But you tell me
Are you happy?
Very much
I'm flying with wings
It is like I'm on the clouds
Put your finger down, yeah
You are pulling here, pull, pull it
Look at the target, lock on the target
Leave it when you are ready
Well done, well done. Come on, one more shoot
When you are ready, hold on
Let it go when you are ready
Well done
My Prince, My Majesty
Welcome Pargalı
Mustafa wants to shoot arrows since he saw the archers competiting at your wedding
İbrahim, I'll be the best archer
Don't call him İbrahim.
You are a man now. It is İbrahim Paşa infront of you
Call him İbrahim Paşa or just Paşa
My Majesty, if you allow, whatever our prince call me is accepted
We are close, are not we my Prince?
Yes, we are
When will my sword trainings start, my Paşa?
We'll go to Janissery House next week then
We may visit the Ağa squat that our Majesty is member of
Don't give me wooden sword again
No, Are you a kid? You'll be using steel sword by now
My Majesty, Venetian Embassador will visit today. Will you accept him to your presence?
You accept them, that'd be enough
Ask them if there's a new news from Luther
Additionally, We'd like to host you with my Hatice Sultana tomorrow evening
We'll attend for sure
My Majesty
My Prince, with your permission
Come on
Hold is steedy, Do you see the target?
Leave it when you are ready
Thanks to you Leo
You are a talented man
Thanks, thanks
So, are you done here?
İbrahim Paşa wants more paintings at another room
After that, it will be over
Hold there, you'll paint our Sultan's portrait yet
The Sultan is not very enthusiastic
Like he doesn't want it
On the contrary, he wants it a lot
I'm very sorry
I didn't know you were here
Sadıka Hatun
I need to tell you somethng
Is it possible to meet in the yard?
No
It is forbidden
Someone might see
I'd be beheaded
Don't be afraid. It is not Majesty's palace. There's noone to be angry
You get some rest
I'll go, My mother is waiting
Thanks a lot. I'm happy to see you
Mahidevran
My Sultana
I heard you came. I was worried  in case you leave withou seeing me
Firstly I wanted to see our prince
Hatice Sultan loves the gift you gifted
Me too aswell
I haven't seen my mother yet. We can visit together if you like
Of course my, Sultana
Don't be too happy because you have the second prince
The important point is that which prince will be sitting on the throne and become the next Sultan
Victoria. err... no
Sadıka
Sadıka Hatun. Huh!
I.. err.. this
Master Nasuh
I can't be here for too long
What will you tell me ?
Look
I drew this not to forget you, your voice and face
I drew you
Won't you say anything?
I should go
Before you go...
I want you to look at my face just once
Look at me once. For God's sake
Please, sir
Someone can see
My Hatice, my dear daughter
Your face is shining
Happiness suits you
Are you glad with Sadıka?
Yes, I'm, mother
As you said, Sadıka is very respectful
Hardworking too
Oh good. It is hard to find someone like her nowadays
We're still not used to your absence
Please visit me every morning
Be with me until the evening
My mother...
I'd like to have dinner with my family tomorrow
I wish to be together in the new palace
We want to host Our Majesty, you, Mahidevran, Gülfem, all the beloved ones
We'll gladly join
My Mother?
Of course we will, my Hatice
Paşa, his lordship, I've brought you the congratulation letter of Venice Doge and Pope His Nibs' eternal happiness wishes
Thank you Senior Mocenigo
Will priest Luther's exile punishment continue?
Since Pope hasn't removed amnesty, it will go on
Unwanted man
When you are the unwanted man, there's no turning back
Paşa, his lordship, your wedding gift arrived to the dock today and been sent to your palace
On the other hand,
Some of our merchants have problems with the customs officers. They pillaged our storages
We are desperate get your help
I understand. Thank you
I'll discuss that with Ayaz Paşa
Don't you worry
What else do you want?
Mahidevran Sultana came and gave a gift
Damn her gift
She told me not to be happy because it is a boy
Mustafa will become Majesty
See what she's saying me
Don't answer. You reached your goal. Don't care them
I just can't do it. When I see her I go on the rampage. I barely hold myself
She does all these favors to get Süleyman's attention
Her favors are fake
My Sultana
Get ready now, Our Majesty is waiting for you in the yard. You are going
Am I going with my Majesty?
Find Gülnihal. She should keep an eye on kids
Welcome, my Sultana
Thank you, Daye Hatun
My mother, if allow me, I wanna go before it is late
I'll be waiting
But, I forgot to say it to Hürrem Hatun
I'll tell her now, don't worry my Valide
You are late my Sultana. Hürrem Hatun left the palace a while ago
Left how? What are you talking about?
She left with our Majesty
Where are they going?
Where are we heading, my Majesty?
It is between your beautiful two lips
This carriage is going wherever you want it to go
My heart's Sultan
The land you step on is my paradise
Are you still here?
My Paşa
I waited for you
I need your advice.
What is it?
Couldn't you talk to her?
Thanks to you I did
So? The conclusion?
I talked to her
She escaped from me like a scared gazelle
What could she do Matrakçı?
Was she supposed jump on you?
Be patien, be patient
You'll soon get the peace in your home, Matrakçı
I hope so, my Paşa
I hope so
Venetian Embassador would send me a table as a gift. Is it here yet?
I have no clue. But...
Is it good?
What are you doing?
I do this since my childhood
My dear mother...
She'd say...
Step on the soil with bare feet
It'll take all the sorrow and pain from you
Soil gives you goodness and joy
Your mother was right
A person can find peace only on the soil
But, I don't know if under soil or on it
She's precious since she gave birth to the second prince
Lucky woman
They do whatever she wants
Reign of Hürrem Hatun has already started
Kalfa!
What are you waiting for ?
Take them
I should hug my grandchildren when Hürrem is not there
I haven't seen them since 2 days
They'd be late my Sultana
Why did they go out? It is never seen before
You'll see
This love to Hürrem will cause a lot of pain to us
My Sultana
İbrahim. Where did this come from?
Mocenigo, Venetian Embassador, sent it
It has chairs
Candlesticks too, made of silver
By now we'll have dinners on this table my Sultana
Very beautiful, look
Like a conversation
These are budgerigars
They are telling their loves to each other
They are singing out all their lives without being tired
These birds are yours
I also will never stop my love
My love
You'll stop
You will
My Sultana
The Queen of my paradise
I'm fascinated when I look at your beauty
Your words are embarrasing me very much
I hope our paradise will last forever
If you are in love...
Consider yourself as thrown away
If you are the king,
Consider yourself as a slave, subject
Oh Love,
I'm like your cheek, it said
Consider the rose ashamed because of its word
You, fairy
If you wish so, you can see me, the loving one, as in fire
Ey, Muhibbi
If you want to find the real taste of pure lips, then look at sugar
Don't be proud of the spring of your life
See yourself in the blend as an individual
They are not back yet, my Sultana
It is late, don't wait anymore
My love
My Majesty
My Hürrem
My deep love
It is morning
Shall we go?
My children await me
There's a letter for you from Egypt, from Kadızade Mehmet Efendi, my Paşa
My Paşa, is it a bad news?
Kadızade states that Ahmet Paşa is building close relations with Mamluk Emirates
Ahmet Paşa...
You won't keep quiet, will you?
You obviously  are after being a traitor
You are making a mountain out of a molehill
This way you are only harmful to yourself, Mahidevran
My Valide, but my Majesty took her out
They are still not back
Perhaps they'll stay a while in where they are
Pull yourself together
Where can Hürrem go leavinh his 3 kids behind?
She could only be away for a day
They'll be back today
We are going to Hatice's in the evening
My lion won't miss that
My Sultana
You are very cheerful today
Look at my birds
My Majesty's gift
Budgerigars
Are not they very beautiful?
They are in love like me and my Majesty
We stayed in the forest until the morning
It was like a dream
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Highness
My Viziers, is there any important matter you want to tell me?
My Majesty, from Egypt
There is a letter from Master Kadızade Mehmet
Has Ahmet Paşa already started being naughty?
How did you guess that my Majesty?
I don't have to be a fortuneteller for that
I know what kind of feelings Ahmet Paşa had while going to Cairo
I know him well
He can never hold his anger inside of himself
Ahmet Paşa is very close with Mamlouks Emirates
He arranges secret meetings
I don't want to blame, but I think he might be having an affair
My Majesty, shall we intervene?
Send a message to Master Kadızade
She should be his shadow. I want to know every step he takes
Paşas, you should take measures
We shouldn't be unprepared
Even if not today, Ahmet Paşa will be a trouble tomorrow
You are my birds too
You are joyfull too
You are my everything
These birds' sounds bring joy
How fortunate
My Majesty's gift
Gülnihal, when will Selim wake up?
I miss my son very much
Let him sleep
He didn't let me sleep last night
We will be going to Hatice Sultana's palace for dinner in the evening
I have to be very beautiful
I am curious about the palace
Did you say in the evening?
It is already evening, let's prepare
It is too salty
Give me a little bit of dough
Dough?
Will you add dough, chief?
Yes, sparty-pants. I'll add dough
It'll take the dish's salt away
Learn these tricks, learn, learn
Come on, quickly
Mumbar Dolması?
Was I right Şeker Ağa?
You are, my Sümbül Ağa, you ar right
The favourite dish of our Sultan
You'll introduce our Sultan's dinner to me
okay
It can't be, my Ağa
It can
Our Majesty is going to have dinner in İbrahim Paşa's palace
His dinner is mine
I'll lay down on the sofa for a while
Wake me up when the dinner is ready
Wake me up
My mother, welcome
My Hatice
Beautiful daughter of me
My Sultana
Mahidevran, Gülfem, you are welcomed too
Thank you my Sultana
It is very beautiful here
Will we have the dinner here?
Yes, my mother
I like this European style very much my Sultana
My Valide, is not ur Majesty coming?
My Valide Sultana, wouldn't you like to have a sit?
Our Majesty should be on the way
We've arrived
I wish everyday was like today
With you daytime and nighttime
You cheered me up again, cheerd my soul up
Come on, let's go
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Highness
My Majesty
You are honoring us my Majesty
Where did you get this?
It came from Venice palace
It is Venice Doge's gift
They value you very much
They obviously want to please you
Infidel's new invention
My mother,
It looks like a European Palace
Hold on, hold on
Don't be afraid of me
I'll not do anything that'd harm you
Just, relax
If there's something you don't like, just tell me
If you have a wish, you can just send me a message
I'll do anything for you
Anything?
Whatever you want
Actaully...
There's something
Just wish it and I'll give my life
I haven't heard...
...from my family since a long time
I wrote a letter but couldn't send
See what you are sad about
Give me and I'll run to send it
There's a big boat at the port
It's name is Fırtına
There's Captain Antonio
Tell him, Victoria's sending
