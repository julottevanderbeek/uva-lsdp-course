Get those boats free!
Get back!
Let him go, let him go!
Clear the way!
Take it easy. No rushing.
Come on, Smith, in you get.
I'm bloody hurt!
I can't see!
Jesus Christ, help me!
Help!
My eyes, my eyes!
Jesus.
Shh!
Now, you're all right.
Lie down, please.
Now, lie down.
You're all right.
Lie down.
That's right.
Yes.
That's right.
Oh, Mother of Christ,
I itch!
Midges. Very nasty.
Heart's sound enough.
What are you doing?
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Hayden.
A lady doctor?
Now, face down, please.
We'll see about those bites
of yours.
Lady, I'm stark bullocks naked!
We're all God's children,
Mr. Murphy,
and I've seen plenty
of backsides before.
You won't be beautiful
for awhile.
But around here,
it won't make any difference.
Where the... am I?
Somewhere where we try
to avoid that kind of language,
Mr. Murphy.
You're at Quiliapo Quaker
Medical Missionary.
There's nothing wrong
with me... language.
Other side, please.
Do you not have
a gentleman doctor?
Other side, please.
Yes, sir.
Lucky only the midges bit you.
Now, the piranha fish
should've picked you
clean down to the bones.
What are they doing?
Come on.
Try and relax.
Relax?
How can I relax with that bunch
gawking at me?
Well, that "bunch,"
as you call them,
have never seen a naked
white man.
Oh.
Well, they've had their thrill
for the day.
Would you tell them to...
leave immediately?
All things considered,
Mr. Murphy,
I find your modesty
rather touching.
I'm sure we're going
to get on splendidly.
Spendidly, spendidly...
Right. There you are.
How do you feel now?
Marvelous.
Now, you take this.
Holy...
You're a very lucky man.
You find anyone else?
We're still looking.
Poor suffering bastards.
I've been trying
to radio a message
about you to Trinidad.
No luck yet, I'm afraid.
Oh, that's very unfortunate,
but I'm in no rush.
Out there,
they're killing people.
I'll try again tomorrow.
What was the name
of your ship?
The Mount Kyle.
Mount Kyle.
If you must radio something,
tell them about that submarine.
And what submarine was that?
The ugly bum bastard
that sunk us.
Hey, came up your river.
No. No, it didn't.
I saw it.
I think someone would have
mentioned it.
I'm telling you,
it went straight past me.
Yes, well,
you've been in a coma.
It was probably an alligator.
Well, this alligator had guns
sticking from its nostrils.
Don't you worry about it.
Try and get some sleep.
Whatever it was, it's gone now.
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
She's...
She's a charmer.
She's beautiful.
Oh, holy, she's lovely.
Good for you.
Water.
Oh, so... it's you.
So, you-you've recovered!
Are you the fellow that...?
Yes, I found you!
God bless you.
I salute your deeds.
Extraordinary.
Cigarette?
No, thank you.
From my position on the river,
I can look to see.
Such a fight!
The flames!
Visible for miles!
Give a touch?
Uh... oh, yeah.
And out of them,
but one man emerges.
One man.
Oh!
Truly heroic.
Nothing heroic, me old, son.
It came natural.
I was saving me own skin.
The name's Murphy.
Louis Brezon.
How are you?
Fine.
Been fishing?
Oh, no.
No. I like to cook,
I like to eat.
I don't like to fish.
Oh.
What do you do here
when you're not, uh,
cooking or eating?
You play cards?
Holy Mother of...
Would you ever take me
for a trip?
Of course.
It's a pleasure.
And then, we can talk about
the British naval tradition, eh?
Naval tradition?
Yeah.
Getting drunk
and catching the clap.
For which I have
the greatest regard.
It seems that this war
will be over soon.
Today on the wireless,
they said Hitler
has been killed.
Don't believe it.
He'll have lived
through the winter.
How I envy you.
The hard glory of combat,
the exhilaration.
Man is only truly alive
when he confronts death.
He can also be truly dead.
Such a bitter thing.
A man like me, to be left
in the backwash of the war.
I begged them,
"Let me face the Germans. "
Oh, no, no.
They insisted my place was here,
in charge of the equipment.
I must admit,
it is very valuable equipment.
This?
No, no, no.
No, the wharf where I live.
I work for the oil company.
I've been left in sole charge.
There are Indians on the river,
who would strip off every bolt
if they were not watched.
I know the feeling.
If it isn't nailed down,
it's mine.
How deep is this?
Deep.
I personally supervise
the dredging
from the mouth of the river
to the headquarters
of my company.
Seagoing ships sailed.
Then a submarine
could get up here.
Submarine?
A German submarine?
Why would one want to?
I'm only asking if it could.
We have picked up a survivor
from the Mount Kyle.
He believes the German submarine
that sank the Mount Kyle
came up the River Orinoco.
He asked me to tell you this.
Half a tick!
I think they found somebody!
Well, now, Lieutenant.
From your ship?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Murphy.
In the flesh.
Anyone else?
No.
Oh, God. It had to be you.
Did the U-boat give you a lift?
Don't be talking.
Any half decent officer
would have sunk
the bastard submarine.
Mr. Murphy, would you please
stop talking to him.
I beg your pardon.
This lady's a doctor.
She's a charmer.
You'll love her.
Murphy.
Any complaints?
I managed to beach the plane.
But first find her,
bring her in.
In? The plane? Why?
Patch her.
Now that's an order, Murphy.
Oh, well now.
Just bring her in, please.
Immediately, sir.
Uh, any notion where she is?
No, damn you. No.
Stop getting him excited.
Excited? Him?
Stupid boring English pilot.
Mr. Murphy,
will you please shut up?
And when you're in the sun,
would you try to remember
to wear something on your head?
Well, look after him.
He's not a bad old skin
considering...
You get out of the way,
and I will get on with my job.
It's no job for a woman.
Louis, you speak the lingo?
Aye, I speak seven languages
and five dialects.
French, German...
Then just ask them where
the flaming airplane is.
Yeah.
What is all this ridiculous...
Wait a minute.
Dr. Hayden.
No, no, I'm afraid I...
You have, uh,
enemy survivors here.
This is a hospital, Captain.
I must know where...
Hospital here.
No, he mustn't be moved.
He's badly hurt.
Please, I don't understand...
No, he's badly hurt.
He's ill. lll.
But, Captain...
Necessity.
Find... uh, not to find.
Responsibility.
with the Third Army ground
forces in Czechoslovakia,
and they give me
a fantastic picture.
One of them told me
he saw columns of...
...ten miles long
on several roads.
...away from the Russians,
toward us.
In those columns were both
soldiers and civilians.
You were right.
There was a German submarine.
They came up here
and shot him.
Bastards.
I'm bewildered, Mr. Murphy.
I mean, why...?
What happened out there?
They shot the entire crew
in the water.
Every suffering...
Except me.
Flying jacket.
I didn't see that.
You weren't intended to.
He didn't want them to know
there was an airplane.
Thank you...
Flying Officer Murphy.
Cover him up and say some words.
He was a particular friend
of yours, wasn't...?
An officer?
I got the impression
you rather liked him.
Come on, Louis,
take her up, take her up!
Easy, Louis.
Easy.
Easy, easy, easy!
Forward!
Good on you, Louis.
Your blood's worth bottling.
You know machines?
What?
You know machines?
I love them.
I've got a feeling
I've found her
It was something she said
She's got me walking
on the tip of my toes
And my hat's
on the side of my head
All of my troubles are mended
She's my needle and thread
She's got me walking
on the tip of my toes
And my hat's
on the side of my head...
I've got a feeling
I've found her
It was something she said...
All along Thomas Street
down by the Liffe
The sunshine was gone
and the evening grew dark
Me arms were around her...
Ah, you're doing well,
me old frog-eater.
The company will give you
a gold watch.
I shall be happy
with my four years' back pay.
Four years?
Yeah.
That's an awful lot of pennies.
You sure they're good for it?
It is a very reliable company.
I have full confidence
in their integrity,
and if not,
I will write them a letter.
Can you fly?
Who do you think kept
this flying lavatory together?
Every scrap of her
is in me fingers.
Yes, but can you fly her?
Don't worry, my old son,
I'll get her up.
And if you do?
I'll find
that bastard bum submarine.
What about getting her down?
Ah, that I know I can do.
Forgive me, but are you sure
that, uh... hmm?
Stop blathering, lad!
The war will be over
before I do anything!
Now, shut up
and cast me off.
Madness.
Come on.
Swing me around.
Fly, you bastard! Fly!
Fool.
Oh, Louis! Louis! Louis!
The feeling!
Oh, Jesus!
No submarine?
Y- You're a bird!
Yeah, but you didn't find
the submarine.
Certainly I found her.
Sitting on its fast ass
up the river.
But they didn't see you?
Certainly they saw me.
Now, uh, a couple
of things to do-
some kip, then I'm going back.
For what purpose
are you going back?
I'm going to sink her.
You see it fly up?
Whoom... you see.
I got it up over the trees.
But you have no weapons.
Petrol.
But the bitch keeps
trying to drag ya down.
But if you give it
a bit more stick-
just like a woman...
- Petrol?
- Yeah, petrol.
But what are you going to do
with petrol?
...a bit more throttle,
you see...
But they have guns
on the submarine?
Yeah, a big bastard
in the front
and then a little fellow
afterwards.
Up she goes!
And of course they will let you
pour petrol all over them
and then watch you
put a match to it.
They might.
They might just do that.
They might.
They might, yes.
They possess your lack
of common sense.
Ah, don't be...
Morning, sir.
What are you doing?
Uh, just borrowing
a couple of your bottles.
Really?
What on earth for?
Uh, I'm refueling the plane,
then I'll be flying off.
I take it your experiments
with the plane were successful.
Great, great.
Have you been taking
your tablets?
Oh, yes.
Well, then,
there's really nothing
to keep you, is there?
How soon will you be going?
Shortly.
I'd be so grateful
if you'd do something for me.
I'll make up a list of things
we need here.
Would you be good enough
to take it with you?
Oh, certainly.
Oh, that's marv.
Thank you very much.
Okay, Louis, the timer.
Louis, the doctor lady-
she's a Quaker.
Mm-hmm.
That's like being a bloody nun,
isn't it?
No.
I don't think so.
Why couldn't she be
a young nurse?
Something practical.
Light the fuse, please.
She has fair form.
Do you ever have any, uh...?
Four seconds.
Never take a crack?
I have great respect for her.
Now.
Provide an essential service
by piloting her
from here to there in my boat.
Six seconds.
Six seconds?
Yeah.
Two and half feet at...
And that's about
nine inches a second.
Here, try the long fellow.
Hmm.
See if it stays the same.
How long have you been here,
Louis?
On your lonesome?
Oh, about six
and half years now.
Six and a half years.
That's an awful long time.
I've known fellows without it
for six months, go bald.
Eight seconds.
Bald?
But this is not my property.
The company only uses explosives
in case of oil fire.
Exactly.
Murphy.
Aah, shut up.
No. What would I say
to my company?
Show them your...
All right.
Be careful with it,
Murphy, please.
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.
How did you learn to make bombs?
From watching me daddy
who made them for noble causes.
Now, hold that.
There.
You have the whole of it...
On the radio,
they say they are surrendering
everywhere.
It's only a question
of hours now
before peace is declared.
They say the Italians...
It works!
It works!
Okay, my son.
Hello.
What a delightful hat
you're wearing, Mr. Murphy.
You like it?
I always did.
You outta nail it down.
Here it is.
You see, I've listed everything
in order of priority.
One-
see that's delivered
to the Society
of Friends in London.
- Right you be.
- Two-
tell your people it's imperative
we have a new transmitter.
Right you be.
- Three-
- Jesus!
take your tablets.
Now.
Uh, if I was you, missus,
I wouldn't stand there.
This fellow makes
an awful clatter...
Oh. Oh, yes, certainly.
Yes, of course.
Way to go, Louis!
Good luck.
Thank you.
Okay, Louis, take him up.
What are the bottles doing
there, Louis?
Bottles?
Those are the world's largest
Molotov cocktail bombs.
Bombs?
Come on, Louis!
Take her up! Take her up!
But what are they for?
He intends to drop
them on the submarine.
He's mad!
Okay, Louis, swing her out.
Murphy,
you can't do this!
Why not?
Louis, stop that thing!
Louis, start that thing.
This is pointless!
The war's almost over.
Listen to her, Murphy.
She may be right.
Louis, if you don't
lower me down,
I'll gut you.
No, Louis. Don't!
This is so wrong!
Tell that to the bastards
on the bottom of the ocean!
I know how you feel,
and what they did was dreadful,
but one senseless killing
after another...
Killing?
If I'm lucky.
And if you're not lucky,
have you thought
what might happen to us here?
Don't worry, missus.
They'll be nothing left
of them Germans but shit.
You're enjoying it!
That's right.
You love your war, don't you?
The war?
Yeah.
I started it.
The whole flaming thing,
didn't I?
Will you think?
Don't worry, missus.
It isn't really a submarine.
It's just a little old
alligator, remember?
You mindless bastard!
I sunk the whore, Louis.
The whole flaming issue
up in the air.
Yes, I know. She told me.
- She told you, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah, she stuck a blunt needle
in me.
You can help me raise him,
Louis.
Mm-hmm.
Now, gently does it.
W- What's going on now?
You have a fractured rib.
Keep still.
Thank you, Louis.
Put your arms out.
Oh, Louis,
you should have been there.
It was beautiful.
I wish I had been there.
Not so tight.
Frankly,
I'd like to choke you with it.
Onward, Christian soldiers
Marching... Ooh!
I am so happy for you.
Ah, Jesus, careful.
Yes, please, be careful.
We have to look after him.
He has been through
a great ordeal.
Thank you for your advice,
Louis.
I'll try to do my best
for your hero.
Meanwhile, would you revert
to your usual practice
of saying and doing nothing?
He doesn't need your support.
You shouldn't have said that
to Louis.
He's a good old froggy.
You have an awful tongue
on you.
Would you lie down, please?
Ah, come on.
What's wrong with you?
We should be celebrating.
Celebrating what, Mr. Murphy?
Your arrival here?
Or the death of those Germans?
What's that for?
It's going to put you to sleep.
Hope you sharpened it
this time.
Don't make me waste this.
We haven't much of it left.
You don't have
a drop of something...?
No.
Ah, no whiskey in the house,
no light in the window,
no welcome at the door.
Call me wealthy.
What are you grinning for?
Give us a kiss.
Good night, Mr. Murphy.
And what's it to anyone
whether or no
Whether I'm easy
or whether I'm true...?
Louis?
I'm sorry, Louis.
Forgive me.
I was upset.
That Murphy seems
to affect us all.
It's not necessary
to discuss it.
We have been friends
for a long time.
I didn't mean what I said.
Without you...
Good night, Louis.
Fire!
Where is he, Doctor?
Mr. Murphy?!
Murphy!
Missus.
Murphy?
Here.
I thought I'd sunk her.
I didn't.
No.
Sorry for your trouble.
It's over now.
Louis!
Yeah.
They didn't find you?
Oh, no.
How are you?
Sound.
Dr. Hayden?
She's okay.
Submarine attacked the village.
Yes.
But I saw...
Yes, yes, me, too.
Have to go and help...
Did they touch the barge?
No, not at all. No.
When's the last time
you took it out?
It's about...
about six years ago.
Actually,
it's a funny story because...
Yeah, come with me...
This is London calling.
Here is a recorded dispatch
from Chester Wilmot.
The dispatch comes from Germany.
This is Chester Wilmot speaking
from a BBC transmitter
This afternoon at 6:30,
British Double Summer Time,
at Field Marshall Montgomery's
tactical headquarters,
signed the documents which
will end the war in Europe
for the 21st Army group
at 8:00 tomorrow morning.
The German war is
therefore at an end.
After years
of intense struggle...
Why did you do that?
Another bloody bullfight.
Ole, ole, ole.
Driving me crackers.
What the hell are we doing?
I'm going to kill
that submarine.
With what?
I'm going to ram her with this.
With my house?!
Aw, don't fret.
The bullets will bounce off her.
Will they bounce off people?
Mr. Murphy!
Mr. Murphy.
Mr. Murphy!
The war is over!
Mr. Murphy!
Louis!
Louis, the war is over!
She's shouting something.
Another flamin' lecture!
Now get down
and check the engines.
Ah, I can operate from here.
Will you just check
the bloody things?
English.
English!
Can't be talking to me.
War end.
Finished.
Turn ship or I'll attack.
What will he do?
Pull out and try and set us up
for a torpedo.
But you said nothing
about torpedo.
Must have forgot.
War over!
Germany surrendered!
Now, give me full speed
when I ask for it,
and then reverse.
But don't you hear?
Murphy, the war is over.
Their war, not mine.
The war is over.
Full speed!
Fire.
Here it comes.
Full ahead port!
Missed.
It's going to hit the beach!
Come on, my son.
Come on.
Come on, my son!
Come on, my son!
Missed the bastard!
Three feet!
Full reverse starboard!
What more can we do?
I'm going to follow him.
Follow him?
Here?
There's nothing else I can do.
Now, full ahead.
Louis...
cut the engines.
What does it mean?
I don't know.
Could be blowing air
from his tanks.
He's run... he's... he's run
his bow on the bank.
We have him, Louis!
Full speed ahead!
We have the bastard!
Come on!
Hey.
You're running aground!
Lower the jib.
Lower the jib!
Come on, come on.
More wire.
Give me more wire.
Whatcha doing?
Their lines are bursting.
He's not even in trouble.
Let her die in peace.
He'll get out!
And I will never find him!
Possibly, possibly not.
I have done enough!
Louis!
I'm not able on my own!
You're a small
and lonely man, Murphy...
...like me.
The world will never build us
a monument.
The difference is,
I know that.
I have you!
Jesus!
