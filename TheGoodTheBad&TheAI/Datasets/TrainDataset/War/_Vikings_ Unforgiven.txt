Thorvard: The Saxons treacherously
attacked King Horik's camp.
The king and his son, Erlendur,
escaped with their lives.
Ragnar: What about Athelstan?
Bishop Edmund:
Here is your destiny, apostate!
Cut him down!
I know things about Ragnar
Lothbrok you do not know.
How do I know you and
I can trust each other?
It is always a strength to know
the weaknesses of your friends.
Lagertha: Bjorn is very happy here.
Then you both should stay.
Lagertha: I must go back to
my husband. I have a duty.
But I leave my son in your good hands.
Lagertha: Don't!
Sigvard: I am your husband!
To make him suffer, as he's
made my family suffer.
More, give me more
Give me more
If I had a heart I could love you
If I had a voice I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings
I... I... I...
If I had a voice I would sing

Seer: Tell me what it is you want.
Are you unhappy?
Do you think the gods have cheated you?
Siggy: I want my old position back.
Everything I had, everything I possessed,
everything that I was
has been stripped away from me.
And my anger is like a stone...
A stone that I carry inside me
that... Weighs me down.
I... I cannot lift it.
Seer: In some ways,
you are still fortunate.
Ragnar could have had you killed
at the same time as your husband.
Siggy: I am supposed to be
eternally grateful
to my husband's killer?
I ask you once more,
why you have come here.
I want to know,
will the gods ever smile on me again?
Seer: The gods will always smile
on brave women,
like the Valkyries,
those furies who men fear and desire.
You'll have to forgive
the poverty of the feast.
It has been a hard winter.
We had to burn our own grain stores
to rid ourselves of Jarl Borg.
Horik: So I heard.
Ragnar: Tell us, Erlendur,
what happened in England, after we left?
King Horik: Ecbert never meant to
honor his promises to you.
We were betrayed, taken by surprise;
Erlendur and I barely
escaped with our lives.
What about Athelstan? Where is he now?
If he is fortunate, he died in battle.
He was a worthless individual.
My sister and I grew to love him
when we were children.
He never denounced his Christian God!
He was our enemy.
We should rejoice at his death.
So... What do you intend on doing now?
King Horik: What do you think, Ragnar?
I intend on gaining revenge on King Ecbert.
We should plan a raid as soon as possible.
Rollo: I would be very
happy to take part in it.
King Ecbert should certainly be punished.
I agree.
We should return to Wessex.
for what he did to my family
and to our people.
Porunn:
Forgive me, master.
No, it doesn't matter.
and if I were you,
I would feel the same way.
We would sail west to raid and to colonize.
That was your dream, Ragnar,
and I have come to share it.
But now we have neither
the men nor the ships
to realize our dreams.
- What are you saying?
- I think we should go back to Jarl Borg.
He is licking his wounds.
He is no longer as strong as he was.
And, yet, we need him.
We cannot go west without his ships.
And so, once again,
we should ask him to join our alliance.
Aslaug:
Don't listen to him.
Rollo: But who should go to Jarl Borg?
After all, you know him better than anyone.
What do you think?
Farewell, my love.
I will pray to Thor
that he grant you safe passage.
King Horik: May you have success, Rollo,
for the sake of all of us.
Warrior 1: Man your stations.
Warrior 2: Stores aboard.
Warrior 1: All the men aboard!
Torstein: Rollo.
I, too, wish you well.
Those words mean a lot coming from you.
They were hard to say. Now they are said.
Cast away!
Horik: It has an unusual taste, wine.
But then, you're an unusual woman, Siggy.
I hope you do not mind
I brought my son with me?
I want him to start to understand the game.
The game?
The game you and I play.
The game Ragnar tries to play.
Are you sure it is a game?
Why do you invite me to your bed?
Why do you tell me things about Ragnar?
Everything I do, I do for Rollo.
And not for yourself?
If Rollo rises, I rise also.
And you need my help!
My son is ignorant of the game
and strangely ignorant
of other things as well.
I want him to enjoy the attentions
of an experienced, free woman.
Siggy: Erlendur, come.
Sigvard:  She sees a hall
more fair than the sun,
There shall the gods
in innocence dwell,
We don't really have poets here anymore.
Poets to entertain us!
Sing to us!
Make us laugh.
I remember when this great hall
was always full of laughter.
Laughter and good fellowship.
My wife has returned to me.
That's good.
Men:
She went without my permission.
But, as you can all see, she has come back
and I love her for it.
at the return of such a wife?
Skol!
Crowd: Skol!
Lagertha: Skol, husband.
Unfortunately, you left my stepson behind.
Man: It's time to leave.
Woman: Gerta, take my hand. Come. Come.
He's old enough to decide.
Is it not enough that I came back?
No, it's not enough, my dear wife,
Of course it's not enough.
It's an insult to me!
What else could I have done?
His father is Ragnar Lothbrok.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?!
A man so bloated with self-importance
he pretends to be descended from Odin!
He doesn't need to pretend anything.
Now I know for sure
why you went to defend him.
Not to repulse a foreign invader,
as you lied to me,
but because you're still in love with him.
You're still in love with Ragnar Lothbrok,
aren't you, wife?
You can sleep alone tonight.
I have made other arrangements.
Lagertha: Ungh!
Master, can I help you?
I was going to ask you the same question.
Those buckets look very heavy.
I'm used to it.
Bjorn: What is your name?
Porunn: Porunn.
Sit a moment.
I have to finish my work.
It is all right.
Where do you sleep?
In that barn
with the other servants and animals.
Do you... Have a boyfriend?
Of course!
I must finish my work.
Ragnar: If you say so.
Hor decide everything?
Can you really forgive Jarl Borg?
Do you know how much I
suffered because of him?
How much your sons suffered?
Yes, I know.
But you do nothing about it!
By insulting and humiliating me,
he insulted and humiliated you!
My father never would have
allowed such a thing.
He would have been revenged.
Your father cannot do too much now,
being dead.
Jarl Borg: Sit down.
What is that?
Jarl Borg: The skull of my first wife.
She continues to advise me.
Is that fair to her?
So... Your brother wants me
to come and fight for him?
He wants to rebuild the original alliance
between himself, King Horik, and you.
He believes that, in our small countries,
cooperation is the only way forward.
So he does not want revenge upon me?
After all, I invaded his lands.
Men like you and I will
always look for revenge.
Ragnar looks beyond.
Then he is a most extraordinary man indeed.
As forgiving as a Christian!
He is also a practical man.
He and King Horik have lost a lot of men.
They need you to help them raid.
You think I should go?
She thinks I should go.
You have a great gift, Athelstan.
I believe it is a... A divine gift.
Athelstan: Thank you, sire.
I thought I might have forgotten, but...
I love these materials.
Brushes, the paints, the colors.
I had not appreciated
how much I missed my work.
The pagans have nothing like it?
Athelstan: No. They have no art.
They can neither read nor write,
except for their carved runes.
King Ecbert: Mm.
And their gods?
Uh... Odin and Thor and Freyr.
How strange you must have found them?
Their gods are very old.
And sometimes I could not help
noticing some similarities
with our own God, and his son.
Come with me.
Athelstan: I find them
indescribably beautiful.
King Ecbert: But they are clearly pagan!
You are only a monk, Athelstan,
and yet, somehow, I begin to trust you.
I feel you... You are a kindred spirit.
Who? Who painted the?
What race of man was ever so glorious
as you say, indescribable beauty?
I have been told, sire,
that you served at the court
of the emperor Charlemagne,
I cannot imagine, therefore,
that you do not know what I know.
That these images were
painted by the Romans.
They conquered these lands
a long time ago.
They conquered the whole world.
But they were pagans.
They worshipped false gods.
Never speak of our conversation
to any other man here.
Nobody else would understand it;
they would fear it!
They accept an interpretation
that a race of giants once lived here...
And that we have nothing to do with them.
The fact is, Athelstan,
we have lost more knowledge
than we ever had!
These romans knew things
that we will never know.
Their pagan gods allowed them
to rule the world.
And what is the lesson
that we can learn from that?
Aethelwulf: Monk, my father
desires to see you.
King Ecbert: Come and see.
Look around.
You thought those paintings
were all that there was.
But of all Roman things,
these are the most precious.
Tales of the Caesars.
The fall and ruin of Roman Britain.
Tales of emperors and empires...
It's the stuff of dreams, Athelstan.
It's the very fabric of dreams.
You can read them, of course.
Athelstan: Yes. Yes, I can read them.
King Ecbert: Good. That is why
I've chosen you.
Athelstan: What do you mean?
King Ecbert: Well, I've chosen you to
be the guardian of these books
and their secrets.
I want you to copy them.
You speak Latin; Not many do.
Your job will be to preserve these works
and these... Fragments
for all eternity.
But if you ever tell anyone about them,
I will let them crucify you.
Jarl Borg: I hope you were telling me
the truth, Rollo.
Torvi: Why don't you ask her?
Ragnar: Please.
Jarl Borg: Earl Ragnar Lothbrok,
can I say, in all honesty,
a greater man than I am.
I know I don't deserve
the chance you have given me
to raid and work with you,
but I swear on my ring,
from henceforth, you've no reason
to doubt my loyalty,
or my commitment to our common cause.
If we are being honest,
I can tell you that it was King Horik
who argued for a renewal of our alliance.
As you can imagine,
I was not, at first, enthusiastic.
But then... Then I realized
what could be gained by inviting you.
We have much to gain if we work together,
and a lot to lose if we don't.
Even I can see that now.
Torstein.
Yes, my lord.
Ragnar: Put Jarl Borg's men in the
barn which the servants use.
And treat them with respect.
Of course, my lord.
Thank you.
I never once for a moment
imagined Ragnar would take my advice,
and invite Jarl Borg
to rejoin our alliance.
As I told you, Ragnar is different.
Whatever you think he will do,
he will always do the opposite.
And I wanted to thank you
for what you did for my son.
You made him a man.
Do not ask me to do it for your other sons.
I am not a whore.
Oh, no. Just for me!
Can you keep a secret?
No.
What's the matter with you, my love?
You don't talk, you don't smile.
My love, you must do better than this.
You know something?
My wife has got the most beautiful breasts.
I keep telling her,
but she doesn't believe me.
She has the most beautiful
breasts in the world.
They're like Freya's breasts.
Sigvard: Let me show you.
Sigvard:
carried a trencher into the hall
and set it down before the throne.
They heaped it with hunks of chopped meat,
and it reminded Thor that rather
too long had gone by
since they had last eaten.
Ubbe: Thor was so hungry!
A chair was provided for Loki
at one end of the trencher,
and for Logi at the other.
_
Ubbe and Hvitserk:
Each of them ate as fast as they could,
edging their chair forward,
and they met at the middle of the trencher.
Loki had eaten every scrap of meat
and left nothing but the bones.
Siggy: Where are you going?
But Logi had not only eaten the meat,
he had eaten the bones,
and the trencher as well.
Ubbe: I think Logi won.
Who is it?
Seer: Yes, I can see, and I see an eagle.
But I also see that
you yourself are the eagle.
Aslaug:  "I would say,"
proclaimed the giant king,
Hush, Ubba. Hvitserk is nearly asleep.
Now you go to sleep.
Ubbe:  I don't want to.
Why not?
Because whenever you dream,
you never know what is going to happen!
Men:
What's happening?
Hey! What?
If you want to live, stay silent.
Man: Shh!
Young man:  Let us out!
Let us out!
Torstein: Where have you been?
Floki: Here and there. Up and down.
Rollo: Where is Bjorn?
He is supposed to be with you.
Floki: I don't know, Rollo.
Rollo: Let's go.
Bjorn:
It is fine, come.
You can sleep here.
No, I can't.
Of course you can. Why not?
This is your place. I cannot sleep here.
Well, don't you want to?
What does it matter what I want to do?
Well, what if I ordered you to stay here?
Then I would have to... Heed your command.
I don't want to order you.
I want you to choose to stay here.
Rollo: Good evening, Jarl Borg.
Agh!
I told you...
I always look for revenge.
Jarl borg:
Torvi: No!
- Rollo: No!
-
Rollo: Not necessary.
King Horik: What is all the commotion?
Ragnar: I am sorry,
that the ambiance of Kattegat
has awoken you.
What is the cause of this?
- King Horik: Is he dead?
- Floki: No, no, no.
He's not dead... Yet.
King Horik: Why have you done this?
Did you really think that
I could ever forgive this man
So what will you do now?
Jarl Borg:
Ragnar: Since you consort with eagles,
I will draw a blood-eagle on your back...
No.
And your ribcage will spring apart.
No.
Yes.
Like wings.
