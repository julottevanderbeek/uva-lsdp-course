Let us pray.
I've got one thing in particular to say to you.
Just one thing we've talked about before.
One thing that gives us peace of mind
even amidst the struggle
that we find our country in.
It's a Christian thing and a British thing.
It's what the Bible teaches.
It's what the Christian martyrs suffered for.
It found root in England,
and not only began to fill the land,
but became the heritage of Empire.
It's the story of the crusaders,
the downfall of the Armada,
the destruction of Napoleon,
and now the thing
that will scatter our enemies again.
The thing is this.
Playing the game for the game's sake.
Gresham needs no introduction.
I have joined the Royal Flying Corps.
It's our new weapon to punish the Hun.
And we're giving them a good beating.
We are caning them.
And you will want to cane them too
when your turn comes.
I only hope it isn't all over
before you get the opportunity.
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye!
- Good luck! Cheers!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Yes, please, sir? Can I help you, sir?
Yes. I'm Croft. Second Lieutenant Croft.
- You're the replacement, sir?
- Yes.
- Just you, sir?
- That's right.
- I'll show you to your billet, sir.
- Thank you.
I'm Bennett, sir.
If there's anything you want, sir, you ask me.
I'm the best corporal, sir.
I expect you could do with
a little light refreshment, couldn't you, sir?
- Yes, please.
- Tea and biscuits, sir.
In the mess in 10 minutes.
Sorry about that, sir.
It should have been sent on, sir.
- See you in the mess, sir.
- Yes. Thank you.
I'm Croft.
Are you?
Where is everyone?
Flying. Whizzing around in circles.
Oh.
I hope you like Rich Tea, sir.
I wangled some Bourbon,
but they got nicked.
- Is Rich Tea all right, sir?
- Yes. Of course.
Grit biscuits.
If there's anything else you want, sir,
just call.
Shall I pour?
Yes, dear. You pour.
- You're not up today, then?
- Hmm. So it appears.
- Neuralgia.
- Oh, dear!
Oh, just in time for tea.
- You must be Croft.
- Yes.
Well, I'm very pleased to meet you.
- My name's Sinclair.
- How do you do?
- You've met Crawford, I take it?
- Well, not exactly.
Croft. Crawford.
Welcome to Saint Urbain.
Not much of a place, I'm afraid.
- Have you had much experience with S.E.5s?
- Well, about four hours.
Oh, you'll be all right then.
Mine's an Avro.
We've been doing some alterations
on the windscreen.
- Do you want to look over her?
- Oh, yes, very much.
"Oh, yes, very much."
Two weeks.
That's how long you're lasting now. 14 days.
So I wouldn't be so, "Oh, yes, very much,"
if I were you.
That's just a piece of impartial advice.
Take it or leave it. Please yourself.
I'm afraid all the planes
are out on patrol except...
- Except mine.
- Except Crawford's, of course.
Help yourself.
- Climb all over the bloody thing.
- Oh, thanks.
- Gresham is the CO here.
- Yes, I know.
Incredible stroke of luck.
- Oh, you know him then, do you?
- We were at the same school.
- Oh.
-
How near the front are we?
Oh, about 10 miles due east of here.
It seems terribly quiet.
Don't worry about that.
It gets much noisier in the Ypres sector.
If the wind's right.
- How do you like my old bus?
- Marvellous.
As a matter of fact,
it wasn't really a stroke of luck.
- What? Oh?
- Well, me being here with Gresham.
No. I asked to come.
Pulled strings and that.
I know you shouldn't, but Gresham's a...
Well, you know.
He was my House Captain.
You know, you mustn't expect him to be...
- Well, he's bound to have changed.
- Oh, yes.
Come on. I'll show you Crawford's.
We had Pups before.
We're damn lucky to get these.
Everybody's after them.
Isn't that right, Joyce?
Yes, sir.
Go on, climb aboard.
We also got a couple of FEs
and Gresham has a Nieuport
he absolutely swears by.
I can't wait to get up.
I expect he'll want you to go up with him,
get to know the landmarks and so on.
It sounds like the patrol is coming in, sir.
Let's go up and see him.
- Shall we?
- Mmm? Oh, yes, of course.
- You all right, sir?
- Fine.
I think we've been hit on the starboard side.
Better check to see if these lines are working.
Right, sir.
Sergeant.
Sir.
- We seem to have been hit on the strut.
-  Gresham.
- I think we should repair this one...
- Gresham.
- It may need replacing.
-  I'll re-rig it, sir.
It's Croft.
Sinclair. Sinclair.
We lost Dickson. He went down
somewhere behind Grand Corps.
You better ring Divisional HQ.
He may be all right.
Right away.
- Have those spares arrived yet?
- I'm afraid they haven't.
-  But they promised.
- Well, there's still time.
- I know, but they promised.
- It's not 5:00 yet.
I'll phone them now.
- Who are the replacements?
- Only one.
Look, send him somewhere else, can't you?
Oh, I think that would be most irregular.
Come on, Uncle. We're all bloody irregular.
That's damned unkind.
He thinks an awful lot of you.
Oh, yes, I'm his bloody hero.
Well, that's only natural.
Maybe, but how long does it go on for?
And when does it stop?
This damn thing's gone again.
And how many squadrons
are there out here right now, 200?
And he arrives right here.
A bloody coincidence!
- You should be pleased.
- I am.
He's an awfully nice fellow.
Look at this.
Notice anything?
That's his sister.
- Oh, my God.
- She thinks I'm bloody wonderful, too.
If only she knew
I couldn't get inside a cockpit,
let alone fly a plane,
unless I was completely plastered.
- Now, look here, old chap.
- Oh, come on, Uncle.
John.
- Why don't you put in for some leave, hmm?
- And go where?
Go home and breathe whisky in her face?
Pretend I've got neuralgia?
No, thanks.
I'll stay here and look after him.
Well, that's what we're here for, isn't it?
Looking after him and people like him.
All right?
You're all so damn young.
-
-
- You know where I'm going after this?
- Where?
You want to know? I'll tell you.
To the hangar.
- And you know why?
- Why?
To check my ammunition,
run the engine, try the controls.
No offence to the mechanics
they're splendid fellows, all of them,
but they don't have to go up
in the sodding things.
Oh, come off it, Thompson.
You'll unnerve him.
Oh! I am just telling him.
What makes me carry on when others falter.
Why I'm still here.
The MC, I have not got.
- But the CMD, I have. CMD?
- Oh.
Confidence in Mechanical Details.
Oh, thank you.
A young Aviator went stunting
And as 'neath the wreckage he lay, as he lay
To the mechanics assembled around him
These last parting words did he say
-  Take the cylinders out of my kidneys
-
The connecting rod out of my brain
Out of his brain
From the small of my back
take the crankshaft
And assemble the engine again!
And assemble the engine
Again!
-
-
-  Bravo!
- All right.
It's the only, only way
It's the only trick to play
He's the only Hun
You're the only Pup
And he's only getting the wind right up
So go on, and do not stop
Till his tail's damn near your prop
If he only crashes this side in flames
Then you'll only know
they'll believe your claims
So keep him right in the Aldis sight
It's the only, only way
- Have you had a drink, Croft?
- Yes. Thank you, sir.
- Incredible coincidence, you being here.
- Yes, wasn't it?
- How many hours have you put in?
- Fifteen.
- Four of them on S.E.5s.
- Oh, we'll soon knock that up.
Yes, starting tomorrow at daybreak.
Excuse me, sir. Some bad news, sir.
It's the sugar, sir, for the custard.
It's the depot, sir.
They sent 200 pounds of salt in error, sir.
Make the custard anyway.
- Without sugar, Bennett.
- Yes, sir.
Signals for you.
- Can you send the steward here?
- Yes, sir.
Dickson didn't make it, I'm afraid.
Poor old Dickie.
It was all burned up when they reached it.
And so was Dickson. All burned up.
More port anyone? Uncle?
Yes, thank you.
What a pity.
- Why won't they give us parachutes?
-
Because we'd all be leaping out.
The sky would be absolutely littered
with shiny little bits of silk.
Yes, I'm afraid they don't have
an awful lot of faith at GHQ.
Rather than save experienced pilots
by giving them parachutes,
they prefer sending school boys
with 15 hours flying.
I suppose they think it looks better.
All those little burning aeroplanes.
Fine minds they have at GHQ.
GHQ.
- About tomorrow, Croft.
-  Yes, sir?
Crawford and I will be taking you up
for a look around.
You want to get all the hours you can.
I suggest you get an early night.
Right.
-  Thank you, sir. Good night.
-  Good night.
God, let me go home!
Croft won't let you down, you know.
All these months he's wanted
to be out here with me.
Well, he's in for a few surprises.
Oh, come on, come on.
I don't think he'll be disappointed.
Oh, no?
And what do you think he'll be
writing in his letters
- to Katherine about me?
- Oh.
That I look twice my age
and get drunk every night.
Look here.
Wouldn't you rather I went up with him?
Don't forget, I'm the House Captain.
- Good morning.
-  Good morning.
- All ready? Raring to go?
- Ready.
Before I left, Katherine gave me this
to give to you.
Thank you.
See if you can find Crawford, will you?
Crawford, are you ready?
- Crawford.
- Get out!
- But Gresham says...
- This is my room!
I'm sorry.
-
- Go and tell Sir
that Crawford's in a frightful funk.
You kill some Huns for me.
He doesn't seem to want to come.
- Cup of tea, sir?
- Uh, no, thank you, Bennett.
Uh, give Mr Thompson my compliments
and ask him if he'll be kind enough
to join this patrol?
Yes, sir.
- Uh, Bennett.
- Yes, sir.
- With my apology.
- Yes, sir.
Yes.
What is it, Crawford?
I can't go up this morning, Gresham.
It's this neuralgia.
We're waiting for you.
The planes are being armed.
I can't see half the time. It's right in my eye.
It's very useful, this neuralgia.
It can't be diagnosed, I understand.
I've got to see the MO.
I'm no use to you here.
- I'll go this morning.
- No, you won't.
- But I've got to.
- You're not going to. That's an order.
All right?
Now, Joyce, what about those
fishtail clips for number one?
Not arrived yet, sir.
- Well, chase them up. Will you?
- Yes, sir.
Well, you can't go up alone, Uncle.
- Best of luck, sir.
- Thank you. See you later.
- Contact.
- Contact.
Keep close to me all the time.
When you get to 6,000 feet, test your guns.
And don't try anything fancy. Understand?
CMD!
- Contact.
- Contact.
- Shaky.
- Yeah, they're getting worse.
Very shaky, I thought.
Poor sod.
Details two and three, stand by.
Come on, get on with it.
- Got one of them on the ground.
-
Got my very own Hun, on the ground.
Well, get the lorry. We'll go and pick him up.
Whoo!
- Croft's not back yet.
- I must have knocked his engine out.
He was standing there as bold as brass.
Thank you.
Oh, come on, let's go and pick him up.
Before they cart him off.
- It's in the French sector.
- What about Croft?
Better phone brigade and tell them to
send over that French liaison bloke.
Otherwise, we'll be all night.
We'll wait for Croft.
When he comes,
he can help me collect my Hun.
And number three wants more.
Yes, sir.
- All right.
- Thank you, sir.
-
-
- Get it moving. Pull him up. Come on!
-
Come on, harder!
You can do better than that.
Come on, now.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Bit lost.
Do you know the way to Saint Urbain?
Saint Urbain?
Yes, that's 20 miles to the southwest.
Right. I'll need to turn around.
- Could you, um...
- Four men over here!
- Turn this aircraft around, Corporal.
-  Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.
-  Contact.
-  Good luck.
Right. Come on, you men.
Dreadful landing.
I did it much better in a field just now.
- Over there, somewhere.
-
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you.
Hey!
Good one.
- Thanks, Gresham. That was tremendous.
- Tremendous?
Was it? What was so tremendous?
The Hun. The way you sent him packing.
Tremendous? Well, where have you been?
I'm afraid I got lost.
I dropped down and asked a battery.
You asked a battery?
- And you didn't tell them to contact us?
- I didn't think.
We were almost certain that
you were missing.
And all the time
you were chatting with a battery?
- I am sorry. I had no idea.
- No!
No idea.
Go on, report your damage.
Croft.
When you've done that,
get out of those things. I'll buy you a drink.
You know, you show too much.
- Yes, I know.
-
Thank you for bringing me, sir.
- He's gone.
- Gone?
But he's my Hun. He belongs to me.
He can't just disappear.
He's my prisoner for
Can you explain that?
For 24...
My prisoner.
I shot him down. Tell him.
People are dying here.
They can't play games with prisoners.
You can't have him. He's a prisoner of war.
unwritten law. Unwritten law.
Can you explain?
He doesn't understand, this idiot.
It's an unwritten law.
We get our prisoners for 24 hours.
Gentlemen, may I present
Beckenauer.
Your very good health, gentlemen.
We're free, yes, free
And we're right at the top of the tree
Where the green leaves always grow
I saw you
We're just a tip of the death to go
We're flying
We're flying
So high
So high
We're the only masters of the sky
auf Wiedersehen, old thing
Cheerio, one wing
Caught high in the sky we'll die!
Perhaps you care
to captain the visiting team.
Thank you.
When you fall,
we will give you a send-off, too.
Wait till you fall.
That's two points for a cannon, I think.
- A pretty big barrage going down.
- Well, might as well get used to it.
Probably last a week.
Oh, damn.
Good try.
I don't think you've quite, uh,
mastered the subtleties of this
particular table.
Good shot, Uncle.
Excuse me.
I wondered, what does one do with
letters around here?
- Letters for home?
- Yes. Just boring gossip.
- Stick them on the table over there.
- Thank you.
- Open.
- Open?
Yes, I have to censor letters.
Oh.
Well, I didn't realise that.
I think I'll just leave it.
- Give me the letter. Give me the letter.
- But it's...
- It's private.
- Don't you understand an order?
- John.
- Don't you John me. Give me the letter.
And go and practise some map reading.
Then maybe you won't have to ask
the artillery to show you the way home.
- My go, isn't it?
- No, it's mine.
I don't want to read the bloody thing.
Shall I read it?
Do what you like.
Do you want to hear this?
"We flew from England,
I'm not allowed to say exactly where.
"Imagine my feelings when they said,
'Report to 76 Squadron.'
"Major Gresham.
All my efforts have worked out.
"John is tired, but only from hard work.
"And the incredible responsibility.
"Everybody says he's a brilliant pilot.
"It was proved to me on my first patrol.
"He shot down a Hun
who had latched on to me.
"But there's nothing vain about him.
"Well, you know John. He's very calm.
"And I admire him tremendously.
"And I'm proud to think he's my friend."
This dent in their line.
What is this dent in their line?
The wire is intact along here.
- What about the dent?
- It's high ground, surely.
How deep is it there? What's there?
Does anyone know?
Oh, we've had patrols,
but they had to turn back.
- Is it concrete? Is it pill boxes?
- Most certainly.
We must have a photograph.
Where is the photograph?
There isn't one, sir. Not for that bit there.
If the barrage hasn't smashed it,
we could get stuck there.
Of course.
- The whole thing could stop.
- Could lose a brigade.
Whole thing could stop.
I'm sorry, but we must have a photograph.
Difficult job, sir.
During a barrage, very tricky.
Of course, it's difficult.
Everything is difficult.
- Yes, sir. But during a barrage...
- So it's a barrage.
It's a barrage!
I cannot stop the barrage.
I'm sorry, but I really can't.
Impossible.
If we lose a plane, what's that? Two men.
But if we go charging in there
with all that concrete still intact,
we could lose a couple of thousand men,
possibly an entire brigade.
- The advance would break up.
- Absolutely.
I'm sorry, but there's no option.
Yes.
- All right. Soon, please.
- Right, sir.
-
-
Terrific bike. Thank you.
Thank you!
I was going to get rid of it.
My wife can't stand the thing.
- But then the war broke out.
-
Stroke of luck, really.
They say, you can hear the guns in England.
Oh, you can. Where I live.
Mind you, that's in the south.
Oh, really? Where?
New Forest near Brockenhurst.
- That's incredible.
- Is it?
Well, that's where we live.
Not Brockenhurst but not far, Lyndhurst.
Oh?
Do you fish?
Come and have a look at this.
- Don't get them like that in Hampshire.
-
We should be getting back, I suppose.
Mmm?
When the offensive starts...
We'll be in the thick of it.
Major Gresham would like to
see you in the office, sir.
Thank you, Bennett.
- What's the idea?
- You knock at the door, Crawford.
Are you spying on me?
Sit down. Sit down!
- Where were you going?
- It's my car, isn't it?
Just answer the question.
- To see a doctor.
- And what's wrong with the doctor here?
Gresham, I'm going home.
I've had enough and I'm going home.
That's all there is to it. I'm sorry.
There you are. I'm ill.
And I'm going home.
- You're staying with us.
- I'm sorry, but I'm on my way.
He'll send you straight back here.
I've been in touch with base, Crawford.
They know all about your complaint.
You've got to let me go.
I can't stand it here.
Please, Gresham.
Gresham, please.
Let me go.
If you go out of here,
I'll have you court-martialled
and shot for desertion.
Do you understand that, Crawford?
I'll have you shot.
Sit down.
I know exactly how you feel.
- You do?
- Yes, exactly.
Empty. Great vacuum of fear.
I'm scared stiff, too, you know, Crawford.
Well, if you know
why the hell don't you let me go?
If you know what real fear is...
Then for Christ's sake, let me out of it.
And what would happen then?
If everybody just went home,
what would happen?
It's their choice. Those who want to die, die.
And those who want to go home, go home.
Stick it out with us, Crawford.
I've every intention of coming through this
and so should you.
And I promise, this will go no further.
Meet me in the mess in five minutes.
Major Gresham sends his apology, sir,
and regrets he won't be joining you.
- This is a new thing, is it?
- They're called strategic planning lunches.
They're all the rage.
Driver.
There's no doubt in my mind
that she's Lloyd George's mistress.
I have it on impeccable authority.
How else do you explain his promotion?
There's a special office in Whitehall
like a bedroom.
- Rubbish.
- I have it on impeccable authority.
Mmm, feasible.
Just got to have it, I mean.
Some people have to have it
every few hours. Feasible.
- I've heard of this complaint.
- Not a complaint. Just a fact.
Not a complaint.
So next to the cabinet room,
there is this bedroom.
Correct. With a private entrance.
-
- Oh, a private entrance now!
Correct.
Correct. With a private entrance.
Where ladies make themselves available
every single afternoon.
- Correct?
- There's a rota.
Oh, the extravagance!
I have it on authority.
I'm sure we're all
very interested to know, Silkin,
exactly what this authority is.
Aren't we?
Agog.
I'm afraid I can't reveal my sources.
Oh.
It was a lady. I can't go any further.
Has this lady, by any chance,
glimpsed inside of the love chamber?
Is she on the rota, Silkin?
- Come on. Spill the beans.
- Out with it, man.
Produce your evidence.
Truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.
It's my wife.
Don't get up.
- Everything all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
- There is one thing, sir.
- Well, fire away.
- My report, sir.
- Your report?
- About the need for parachutes.
Parachutes.
Oh, didn't we get something back on that?
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Yes, possession of parachutes. What was it?
- Might impair a pilot's nerve, sir.
- Oh, that's right.
When in difficulties
might impair a pilot's nerve.
It's a good phrase that.
Sorry, but there you are.
Sit down.
- Your orders.
- Thank you, sir.
And I said to myself, to myself I said
Oh, we haven't got a hope in the morning
You got your tongue out, Tommy.
Haven't you got anything better to do?
Just an observation.
I fly with my tongue out, too.
Isn't that terribly dangerous?
Only if it gets frostbite.
And now, Thompson's
patent grenade dropper.
- How about that?
- Very good, very good.
- Gresham, have you seen this?
- Very good, Tommy.
The wind socks squirming
The corps has chugged its insides out
On its blooming own
Can't you hear it grinding?
Who the hell's a pining?
Can't you hear the fabric rip
With a sad, sad moan
Fancy a walk, Uncle?
They're even louder tonight.
Yes, it's their final effort.
The offensive begins in three days.
- We'll be busy then.
- Yes.
Only, they want some pictures first.
- And that's where I come in, is it?
- Yes.
I'm awfully sorry, Uncle.
- Someone has to do it.
- Yes.
They asked specially for you.
I'm flattered.
- The barrage won't be lifted, I'm afraid.
- Oh, good heavens, no.
It stinks, doesn't it?
Oh.
I'll send Roberts and Wade to cover you.
They're good chaps.
Who would you like as your driver?
What about Croft?
Croft?
He only has to fly in a straight line.
Yes, that's all.
Why not Croft?
He has to take his chance,
like everybody else.
All right, take Croft.
- How you feeling?
- Fine.
Got a couple of chaps on top,
keeping an eye on us.
- Shouldn't take too long.
- No. Quite.
It's just the hanging around.
- Well, I think I'll go...
- I'm glad...
I'm sorry. After you.
I was just going to say
I'm glad I'm with you.
Me too.
Oh, Gresham should be here soon.
It's almost time.
OK, sir?
I hope you won't miss lunch, sir.
I've wangled two dozen lamb chops.
I have every intention
of being back for elevenses.
I'll see what I can do, sir.
I think we should be going,
don't you, Uncle?
Yes. I suppose we should.
Remember what I said. Keep above 200 feet.
Don't make a song and dance of it.
I won't.
-  Contact.
-  Contact.
Oh, sorry, sir.
The recce's back, sir.
Thank you, Bennett. Thank you.
Christ! Uncle, we're alive.
Gresham, you never saw anything like it.
They must have felt sorry for us.
We were sitting ducks. They just...
I never want to be that close again.
Stephen.
Leave them alone.
They'll be up on the screen in a minute.
Why are we waiting? Why are we waiting?
Get your hands off, will you? Come on.
Why are we waiting?
Put them down.
You'll get your grubby thumbs all over them.
Oh, look at this one. Look, look!
- Anything more to eat, sir?
- No.
- Mr Croft isn't here yet, Bennett.
- I know, sir. I did look in his room, sir.
Lights, Bennett. Lights.
- He didn't say he wouldn't be here, did he?
- No, sir.
Go and find him and tell me where he is.
- Lights, Bennett.
-  I'll put them out, sir.
Thompson, are you sitting in the stalls?
I'll sit where I like. I shan't be moved.
Boo.
- Why is that lady standing...
- Bottoms up!
- What are you doing with your fingers?
- My hands are shaking.
Right.
- Ship ahoy, my lovely.
-  What a big pussy!
Fair game, I'd say.
Give me the lion's share of that one.
- Tommy, don't go into a spin.
- Next.
Cheeky!
Let's see what she's like in the front.
Turn her around.
- Well?
- No. It's the same this side.
Where you spending your leave, Albert?
Leeds?
- Where else?
- Halifax.
Funny!
I've never been to Leeds.
- Well, you wouldn't like Leeds.
- Why not?
- A dirty place is Leeds.
- Muck hole.
Aye. Clean muck right up to here.
Been to Venice, Paris, Heidelberg.
Never Leeds. I don't know why.
- Peckham?
- Where?
Peckham.
- No, can't say I have.
- Oh, that's funny.
- I'd have thought you would have.
- Why exactly?
He's pulling your leg, sir.
Oh.
Good one.
Fancy a sandwich?
- Go on.
- It won't bite.
Thank you.
Now for your delight and delectation,
I give you that.
Ooh!
We're getting fussy, William.
More your style really, Tommy.
What I'd call udderish.
- I wouldn't say no.
-  You never do.
- About Mr Croft, sir.
- Yes?
- Apparently, he's in the hangar, sir.
- Thank you, Bennett.
Is Mr Croft here with you?
Did you hear me?
I said do you know where Mr Croft is?
Yes, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Well, I was just talking...
You missed dinner.
- Corporal Eliot gave me some.
- Corporal Eliot?
Since when have you been dining
with Corporal Eliot?
- He offered me a sandwich, I...
- Wait outside.
Don't finish that. Wait outside.
Thank you, sir.
You make a fool of yourself, being with them.
They laugh at you.
You insult your fellow officers
by avoiding them.
Sorry I came here, John.
I've obviously offended you.
Only when you humiliate yourself.
- Now clean up and join us in the mess.
- I can't.
I can't sit there.
How can I when Sinclair is dead?
My God. You superior little bastard!
You really do believe
you're the only one who cares, don't you?
Well, I resent that.
I can't tell you how much I resent that,
you prig.
He wasn't my House Captain.
He was my friend.
That's a very good idea.
Oh, Crawford offered to run us into Amiens
for the night. What do you say?
But I can't take everybody.
Nobody's asking you
to take everybody.
- Yes. Yes, let's go to Amiens.
-  Right.
It's only a five-seater.
One thing. Croft will be joining us.
All right.
- Full house then.
-
Come on, Crofty!
- Right.
- Come on. Get in there.
Come on, get your priorities right.
CO first.
Dive in!
There's a table.
Say  to the lady.
Guys, quality has taken
a bit of a dive this year?
Well, chaps, here's to a jolly party.
Drink your booze properly.
- :
I have a premonition.
I have a premonition
that Wade here is gonna be sick.
Aren't you, Wade?
It is distinctly possible.
It is distinctly possible that I may be sick.
- Bravo!
-  Bravo!
Hey, she's giving me the eye, that one.
I don't want any of them.
I'm waiting for my blonde.
She's in hospital.
Oh, no, she isn't.
I saw her half an hour ago.
She must have discharged herself
knowing that you were here.
Now, which one should we choose for Croft?
Ah.
Choose one, son.
I'll bring him back a recommendation.
I'm going on a little trip.
Do my duty by the little fellow.
As a reward for so much patience.
Well, go on then. Get on with it.
Talking about it doesn't count.
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
- Good luck.
Tell us, Croft, laddy, when you had it, last?
Yes, come on, Croft.
Now speak. Speak, Crofty.
When was your wick last dipped?
As old Shakespeare says.
Yes, we shan't tell.
Despite what mummy said to you
it was not made for pissing through.
Champagne!
Ah, I do believe
Wade has got a little present.
Not bad.
Mmm, I won't have to force myself.
- Are you well?
- I'm very well. Very well.
-
-
He is . He has nobody.
Poor Crofty.
I look after you?
Crofty, I think you might be lucky.
She is not his girl, that officer.
She belongs to his friend who is in Paris.
This man is her chaperone.
Understand?
Yes, I think we do.
She is also bored.
When she goes, you go after her... Behind.
Fine. Fine.
Crofty!
Keep the home-fires burning
While your hearts are yearning
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home
There's a silver lining
She go!
Crofty, off you go.
Contact, old boy.
- Don't stall.
- Happy landing, Crofty.
Shh.
Eighteen?
I do not speak English very good.
I never have no one in here.
You should not be here.
It's very dangerous for you here.
I have this friend but he's
Do you want to stay?
Yes.
Oh! You're a pilot!
- Yes?
You're very
- Is Paisley in, Roberts?
- No, sir. Not yet, sir.
- I want everyone in the mess.
- Yes, sir.
- Care to inspect the menu, sir?
- Not now, Bennett.
Well, can I take it as all right, sir?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
I'm afraid we've got a rotten job.
Or a wonderful job,
- according to your point of view.
-
Sorry, sir.
The offensive is bogged down,
particularly in our sector.
And the reason that we're told is that
their artillery is knocking out
our communications.
And the reason that they can do this
is because they've got balloons
spotting for them.
So the balloons have got to come down.
Now some of you have
had a go at balloons before.
In which case, you'll know
at least two things about them.
The moment that we appear,
they winch them down. That's one.
The other, well, they're murder to get near.
There's nearly always
a regiment of Archie on the ground
and two or three patrols up above.
So we'll split ourselves into attackers
who'll be armed with tracer,
and defenders who'll deal with their scouts.
Now, the thing to remember about them
is not to get too near.
They have a nasty habit
of exploding in your face.
Right, attackers.
Thompson, Crawford and Croft.
Defenders, Wade, Frampton and myself.
We'll leave at first light.
Yes?
It's Croft.
All right.
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- It's nothing.
I was wondering...
Do you want to go into town tonight?
I don't think we're allowed to.
Risk that?
If I went into town, I wouldn't come back.
Ever.
They'd have to shoot me.
You see?
-  Wait for me!
-  Hold it, driver!
What, no transport tonight then, sir?
- All right.
- Come on, sir.
- Away you go!
- In you get!
-
- Can I come in?
Yes.
I'm buying drinks in the mess.
Would you care to join us?
I don't...
I don't think so.
I'd like you to.
You'd like me to, but I won't.
-
-
Contact!
- He's out of it.
- Shh.
Crawford!
Crawford!
Go and put him to bed.
Don't tell anyone.
-
-
-  Good night, sir!
-  Good night!
Enjoy yourself, Stephen?
Yes. Thank you.
Fine.
Have a good night's sleep.
Yes.
Right.
Stephen.
Crawford won't be with us tomorrow,
I'm afraid.
At this very moment,
those balloons are going up, up, up.
And in another hour,
they'll be going down, down, down.
You hope.
Thank you, Bennett.
- You're a defender?
- That's right.
We'll be safe as houses then.
Off you go.
Stay close to Tommy.
Do what he does, then get away.
Jolly good.
Bennett!
- Yes, sir.
- Breakfast at 9:00.
How many for breakfast?
Eh?
Any of them?
The replacement officers.
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- How do you do, sir?
Sir.
Welcome to 76.
- How many hours?
- How many what, sir?
Hours, you chump.
Oh. Fourteen, sir.
Fourteen.
-  Bennett.
-  Sir?
These windows are dirty.
Yes, sir. I'll see to it, sir.
-  Does anyone play the piano?
- Oh, I do, sir.
Good. That should liven the place up a bit.
Right. Well, off you go. Dump your stuff.
