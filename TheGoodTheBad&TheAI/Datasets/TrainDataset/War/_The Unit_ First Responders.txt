Monkey see,monkey say.

Mom... mom,can i have this?

Ok.
Please ring these up
And put 'em in a bag

Hold on. Hold on,molly.
I've got tiffy here.
They're sending mack out
so frequently,
He wanted
to get a few gifts
And keep 'em
in the closet
So he could bring 'em back to
the girls when he came home.
Where'd they send him
this time?
Oh,that's nice. What?
Where are they

Oh,they've got him
working
Down on something
in st. Louis.
Nangahar province afghanistan
Hello,welcome
A coffee large and sweet
for the commander
Now,who are you?
With your permission,sir
We are two businessmen
On the way to tirbiz
Sir,i am sure
Our papers are in order
I do myself the honor of paying
For the commander's drink
We've got uninvited guests.
You wanna wait
till they're gone,boss?
No. The plane
only gets one shot.
We don't know where our
weapons dealer is headed next.
We've got to go now.
Boy,find yourself something better to do
Block the alley
with the mule.
The commander can see
the label designator.
Let them know
the target vehicle's arriving.
Come on. Come on.
Move,mule,move
Get that son-Of-A-Dog-Mule out of my way
You might want to reconsider
your tone of speech
Got it.
Target locked.
Firing missile.
Focus,guys.
Do not insult my mule
Here's a lesson for you
How do you like your precious mule now?
It's better than a show
Find those men
Look for them
Where are they?!
? The one for jen says,"i love you.
I'll see you soon.
Love,daddy. "
And lissy's says,"what do you want
me to bring you back from the trip?
Love,daddy. "
What am i bringing her back
from my business trip?
A doll.
Mack. Tiffy.
Sorry to take him away so soon
when you just got him back.
No,you aren't,tom.
Nobody likes a liar.
Well,she could have
married a banker.
I didn't want a banker.
I wanted you.
I'll meet you in the cave
in 5 minutes
To go over orders.
Bye.
I love you.
What brings you
down here,colonel?
Got a new man on the team.
He's out in the field
with jonas,
But his wife just arrived
ahead of him.
This kim brown?
Yes,ma'am.
We were waiting for
her over at molly's.
I got her a house
across the street.
Well,she's in
getting her gig basket.
You come pick her up?
Pocatello idaho
Ruthie.
Jonas.
How are you?
The place looks lovely.
I don't want you riling him
all up about coming back.
Wouldn't think of it.
No,i know you wouldn't
think of it,
But you'd do it.
This here
is bob brown.
Ma'am.
How do you take
your coffee,bob?
Black,please,ma'am.
How's molly?
She specially asked me
to ask you to call her.
He's happy here,jonas.
You a married man,bob?
Yes,ma'am,i am.
Fine institution,
marriage.
I believe it even
mentions it in the bible.
Something in proverbs
About not coming between
a man and his wife.
Molly: i used to have
a little girl
That coincidentally
used to be your age,serena.
She's all grown now,
in college.
But do you know
what i did yesterday?
What?
I went through
her abandoned things,
Laid them out in her
old room,and later today
You can have your pick of
some of her outstanding toys.
Toys?
Any help you neád
- Hanging things,storing things.
That's sweet,but my husband's
about as handy as can be.
Then you're one lucky woman,
Because my husband can pound
sand with a plastic shovel.
Your husband's bob.
Who do i ask
for the date of his return?
The commander
will be with you soon.
Explain what he can.
Until then...
You two must be
traveled out.
How'd you like to
see you new home?
Our new home?
I got you a place
right on our street.
Are these the other
members of the unit?
They used to be.
Th're on deployment,
which means-
Bob did two tours in iraq.
I know what deployment is.
Where is he?
How can i contact him?
He's in idaho on a training
mission with my husband jonas.
||The commander's the only
one who can get ahold of him.
You know,i think i'd like
to talk to the commander now.
Ruthie: here you go.
Thank you,ma'am.
You have
lovely manners,bob.
My wife trained me.
How's she like the unit?
She just went down.
Bob's new to the unit.
Passed selection,
did induction training.
This is his
first time out.
We always sent
the new man out
To bird dog the team leader.
Yeah,put a goat
in the stall
To quiet
the young colt down.
Welcome to the unit,bob.
Thank you,sergeant.
Oh,just ron will do.
Welcome. And should your
friend the sergeant major
Try to lure my husband
back to boys town,
I hope you'll intercede
on my behalf.
Why shouldn't he
come back?
Because we've got
a new house,
Because he's making
a fine living,
Because they didn't appreciate
him when they had him,
An because he's doing better
than being paid 12.50 an hour
As a civilian contractor
building guns
For a fi||ional agency
of the government.
He'd be back with
his friends,ruthie.
What in the world,for real,
Are you boys doing up here?
We are on a top secret
mission in your fair state
Laying out a new course for extended
deployment with pack animals.
Mules.
You're kidding me.
Nope. Scout's honor.
We are to learn
to work with mules.
We had an incident
with one.
Sent us back
to first principles.
Then you sign up your mules
and you leave me mine.
What we got here
is a u. S. Government issue
.22 caliber silenced
semi-Automatic weapon.
It just happened
to evaporate
From company stores
a few years back,
And which i have been
restoring for my personal use.
Thieves. All of them
disappeared.
That is correct. They did,
As fellows in the unit carried them
off home to deal with squirrels.
But our young friend here
came too late to that party,
And don't we think he ought
to have one,too?
This is for me?
May all your troubles
be small ones,son.
Mrs. Gerhardt. And you
must be mrs. Brown.
Colonel tom ryan.
No time to provide
anctual welcome.
Usually the family
readiness group...
Thank you,colonel.
They met me,and they
were most helpful.
Good. Now you know the
men are deployed as needed.
Tiffy here...
My mack's been out 4 times.
He comes in,colonel bounces him
back out like a ping-Pong ball.
Because he's needed.
- I understand that.
- Then-
My plan,colonel,which as
you know is within the regs,
For a family
of my husband's rank
To elect to live off base.
That's fine after
a period of adjustment,
Bu i find families do better
with some support early.
But my husband...
we agreed...
Mrs. Brown,i understand that
you're under considerable pressure-
No,i understand my husband's
just on training mission.
And who told you that,
please?
This is why
i'm here,colonel.
I need to get a message to him
regarding our living arrangement.
Who told you,please,that
he's on a training mission?
Molly was just explaining why
he wasn't here as expected.
Because-
Excuse me,
please,ladies.
You want to just take
a look at the place?
You know,some of your range
records are still standing.
That's because the guns
i set those records with
Have been mothballed.
Just a few of 'em.
Ron here went from being
the best shot in the unit
To the best gunsmith
in the world.
Ladies man to being
ladies maid.

What is the 303rd-
The 303rd logistical
studies unit
Is where
your husband works.
That is his cover.
It is your cover.
Other than that,
this unit has no name.
Other than that,
it doesn't exist.
You will live that cover
As if your husband's
life depended on it.
As believe me,
it does.
Every person who knows one
more piece of information
Is one more person who could
get our husbands killed.
You do not||ell
your mother,
||Ur best fr end,
your priest,
What your husband does.
I need to talk to someone.
Would you like to talk
to the chaplain?
What denomination is he?
He is the unit chaplain.
He's your
denomination now.
Please take those boxes away.
I'm not living here.
I'm free to live off-Base

I'm not feeling well.
I need to lie down.
You can lie down here.

Authorities say

Tiffy,ctil dr. Farris.
Right here

The attempt to assault

Winds out of the north-
I don't care

You have to come in

Hijackers got a spotter.
They have to have a hotter.
blind spot of the plane.
There it is.
There it is.
Abort! Abort!
Bank left! Bank left now!
Take a bearing on that.
It'll bear 2-6-5 magnetic from
the midpoint of the airfield.
We are about
to eat a rocket.
Can you sideslip me
and put it on the road?
I didn't exactly faint,
but i felt-
Pregnant?
Congratulations.
I'm pregnant?
Ho||about that?
Why did i feel-
Faint? Happens to a lot
of women in your condition.
It didn't with my first one.
Uh-Huh. Have you been under
a lot of stress lately?
My husband-
Her husband's a little late
getting back tg the base.
What's the punch line,bill?
Punch line's r&r.
You got a pretty good
group to take care of you.
Promise me you'll
let them do that.
I had a miscarriage befo||.

Last year.
Are you sure everything's

You can do a couple of
tests,can't you,bill?
Put her mind at ease.
Of course.
Wyndam regional airport
Tv reporter: just moment||ago,
the body of one hostage
||Was unceremoniously thwn
out the passenger door.
It is becoming abundantly clea
That these terrorists
have a well conceived plan
To take the life
of one hostage every hour.
Update.
They just shot
another hostage.
Where's blane and brown?
Just arrived on scene.
Williams and grey?
team's 20 minutes behind them.
And they're shoo||ng
a hostage every hour?
Yes,sir.
Eric?
Sir,we sucked up some radio
and they're speaking arabic.
What is he saying?
Can we hear it again?
Yes,sir. He's saying-
Wait. He's saying...
Yaalah halan.
What else?
Uh... the other fellow
iswaying...
Don't set it off until
the news trucks come.
They're suckering in
the first responders.
They're gonna shoot ||e
rescue plane out of the sky. ||
They get enough
on||okers on the ground,
Th||'re gonna
blow up the aircraft. ||
Give me a secure line
with blane.
After that,i'll need
to talk to washington.
Tv reporter: the passengers
are part of a trade delegation
G the western states
in an effort to promote
New european imports
to this country.
They could not have
anticipated...
Gentlemen,
as per my orders
You have no authorization until
your entire team is in place.
||I'm sure that authorization
is for||coming.
This ope||tion's under the
control of the bol|| asac.
As its representative,and on
behalf of the justice department-
Would you excuse me,please.
And on behalf of
the justice department,
I just want to advise you that
any further action on your part
Will be treated as a
violation of federal law.
Yes. We heard you.
We take down the plane,
he takes credit.
We get everyone killed,
he told us so,
We get court-Martialed.
So let's not get
everyone kil||d.
Most of the wives in the special
forces community have girls.
What does yours feel like?
The women
mostly have girls?
Why? No one knows.
No one knows.
Oh,honey,we're gonna
spiritualize you
To all sorts of mysteries.
Tv reporter: authorities say
they have yet to||ake demands.
Saddle up.
Targets have spotters.
No quick drop.
We gotta haho.
What's our altitude?
Take it up to 35,please.
Thank you.
Jonas: roger that. We're gonna
have to step things up a bit.
The bad guys,it seems,are
waiting for a full scale assault.
They want to lure more troops
and more media to the area.
They don't care about
the businessmen.
They want to kill
the first responders. Rs
They got some sort
of cute bomb on the plane.
And these chuckleheads
waiting for authorization
Are gonna get
a lot of people killed.
Now,we are gonna
take down this plane.
Yaalah halan.
||Say it.
Yaalah halan.
Meaning look out
or get ready.
It's what the lookout says when
assaulters approach the plane.
It's the spotter's signal to lower
the air stairs to repel an assault.
Say it again.
Yaalah halan.
My name is black,united
states special forces.
Who can show me
a ranger tab?
Grab your beer,gentlemen.
Come with me.
You. You are now
spotter for the sniper.
You go with and will
answer to mr. White.
You two with your shotguns,
on my command,
We're gonnae
take down that plane.
Team,
You are to approach
from the north.
I count a minimum
of 3potters.
When you neutralize them,
You are to break squelch
That is my signal
for standby.
When you've done that,
you will pick up their radio
And signal them yaalah halan.
Sergeant white,
||you're the sniper.
Sergeant,you're
under my command
And i'm ordering you
to stand down,
Awaiting further orders should
they be forthcoming. Is that clear?
Yes,sir.
It is clear.
Angers,
Did you sign on
to get out gf the house?
Or do you want to come with me
and kick the door down?
Take down the spotters.
How's the world||
look to you?
Li||t and bright.
You've been training for
th|| moment your entire life.
The universe
has been conspiring,
If you think about it,to
put you right here right now.
Off you go. We're
all waiting on you.
||||Events on this airfield|||
appear to be unfolding
At a dramatic pace.
Ma doesn't let the
girls watch the neh.
Lissy: we're not allowed
to watch the news.
Mack says...
No truth in the news,
And no news in the truth.
Yo|| second? Well,
you know what they s||:
Are you excited?
Of course.
So what's it like here
on the base?
Well,it's like
it is anywhere.
The life is
what you make of it.
We've got the kids.
I've goti'ack me of the time.
And there's work. Maybe
not right away for you now,
But i teach school here
And,you know,

I'm fine,but-
No,no,no. The baby's fine.
||'S just the housing

Bob's no||gonna be happy.
I'm not happy.
He's out on deployment.
Where? You wanna know where?
Just turn on your television.
Just turn it on.
You hang up that photh.
What would you do if a woman camominto
your home to harm your family? F
You hang up that phone.
Your unit is restricted
by the posse comitatus act
From||ny action until released
by the justice department,
Which will be when your
compl||e team is on the ground.
By then,another hostage
or two will be dead.
Do i have to
place you in custody?
Sir,that won't be necessary.
So you're stepping down?
That won't
be necessary either.
Nobody shoot.
They're friendlies.
Who the hell are they?
That's black
and that's white.
I thought those
we|| your names.
They're our brothers.
Where you going
in the middle of the night?
Running away?
I'm not running awayin put

I'm going
to my sister's
Because i need her help.
I mean,y'all been
real nice to me,
But i need
my family and-
We'r||your family.
Don't tell me
you're my fa||ly now,
||Cause my husband
gets shot in idaho||
||D in 90 days
i'm off the base
And you can't
remember my name.
So if you'll excuse me-
I swear,if you walk out,that's the
end of your marriage. Your husband-
They'll send him back
to the cav.
And do you know what he'll
think every tim he looks at you?
E woman who ruined his dream.
Do you know how hard it was
for him to get here?
You're willing
to throw that away?
You said you love him.
Now,are you brave enough
to act on it?
Here you are||
Pretty little girl,
a ||ne daughter,
A child on the way,||
a man in combat.
You're frightened
and you want him home.
This is not your own
special circumstance.
You know what this is?
It is the history
world.
You want to think
about that for a moment.
T
That's the signal.
Hey,mort.
Sergeant,where
do you think you're going?
I'm gonna take down
that plane||
And i've got my
best man in the ||ods.
If you give me up,
He will come down afterwards
and shoot you dead.
You,you,and you,
Panic. The rest of you
come with me.
Yaalah halan.
Nobody move.
Nobody move.
It's all over.
This is the united states army.
Put your hands on your head
and get out of this plane.
Proceed pr the stairs
toward the vehiclesic
With your hands on your head.
Get off this plane!
Get off this plane!
Get off this plane!
Keep it moving!
Let's go!
Le||s go!
Keep it moving!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Let's go! Hurry up!||
Get off this plane now!
We're clear here.
I'm just gonna pluck
the detonator out.
Tell the first responders to
stand clear of the aircraft
For the next minute or so.
Coming out.
Tv reporter: what an ordeal for
every member of this tr||e delegation.
Within a matter of hou||,they finally
find themselves ||ee of ruthless terrorists
With a mission to kill.
Some observers say
it is remarkable,
Perhaps miraculous,
that only 3 hostages-
Where's our 737
with the rest of the team?
Still half an hour out.
As far as washington's
concerned,
This was one hell of an
operatioop by the national guard.
Yes,sir.
They have witnessed
what can only be described
As one horrific day
For a group of visiting
businessmen and women.
And it||ppears,
as you can see behind me,||
That all the hostages
are safe.
It's not much
to look at,
But it's ours.
You kidding? Get to shoot
guns,jump out of airplanes,
Come home to your family.
That's damn near perfect.
This is my house here,
Which means
that's your house there.
I don't even
have a key.
Welldone.
Tv reporter: the reaction of the
fbi was,in the president's words,
A perfect example of coordinated
interagency cooperation.
How'd you know
i was comi|| home?
I figured they'd
have you back for debriefing.
How are things
