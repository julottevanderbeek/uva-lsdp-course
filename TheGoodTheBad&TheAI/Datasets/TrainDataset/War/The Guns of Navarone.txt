Greece and the islands
of the Aegean Sea...
have given birth to many myths
and legends of war and adventure.
These once-proud stones...
these ruined and shattered temples...
bear witness to the civilization
that flourished and then died here...
and to the demigods and heroes
who inspired those legends...
on this sea and these islands.
But, though the stage is the same,
ours is a legend of our own times...
and its heroes are not demigods,
but ordinary people.
In 1943, so the story goes...
on the tiny island of Kheros...
exhausted and helpless.
They had exactly
one week to live...
for the Axis high command
had determined...
on a show of strength
in the Aegean Sea...
The scene of that demonstration
was to be Kheros...
itself of no military value, but only
a few miles off the coast of Turkey.
The cream of the German war machine,
rested and ready...
was to spearhead the attack...
and the men on Kheros were doomed...
unless they could be evacuated
before the blitz.
But the only passage to and from Kheros
was guarded and blocked...
by two great, newly designed,
radar-controlled guns...
on the nearby island of Navarone.
Guns too powerful and accurate for any
Allied ship in the Aegean to challenge.
Allied intelligence learned
of the projected blitz...
only one week
before the appointed date.
What took place in the next six days
became the legend of Navarone.
Yes?
Sorry. I'm looking
for Commodore Jensen.
I'm Jensen.
Come in, Mallory.
You're late.
Well, I'm sorry.
My plane was attacked outside of Crete
and we got into Alex on one engine, sir.
The Germans have raised the price on you
and Andrea Stavrou to £10,000 apiece.
- Are you flattered?
- No, sir. How did you know that?
I should do.
I'm your boss.
You've been working for me
for the past 18 months.
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance
at long last.
- They told you you were going on leave?
- Yes, sir, they did.
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that's not true.
Not yet, at any rate.
Well, here's your old chum.
Come say hello.
Keith, you haven't changed
since Athens.
Hello, Roy.
Come along, gentlemen, will you.
Barnsby, these gentlemen have
a special interest in Navarone.
We picked you up on radio, of course,
but you can be more specific now.
I'll be specific.
As you can plainly see,
it was bloody awful.
Squadron Leader Barnsby
is Australian.
But we'd love to go back.
Wouldn't we, boys?
- Sure!
- Just as soon as we can, but...
only on one condition.
We want the joker who thought
this one up to come along with us.
And when we get there...
we're gonna shove him out
at 10,000 feet...
without a parachute.
- It was as bad as that?
- Bad?
It can't be done.
Not from the air, anyway.
You're quite sure about that,
Squadron Leader?
- This is important.
- So's my life.
To me, anyway.
And the lives of these jokers here,
and the 18 men we lost tonight.
Look, sir...
first...
you've got that bloody old fortress
on top of that bloody cliff.
Then you got
the bloody cliff overhang.
You can't even see the bloody cave,
let alone the bloody guns.
And anyway, we haven't got
a bloody bomb big enough...
to smash that bloody rock.
And that's the bloody truth, sir.
- I know how to hit those guns, sir.
- Yes?
Yes, sir.
You fill a plane full ofTNT...
and then you do a suicide dive
right into that cave.
There's just one problem, sir.
Getting someone to pilot the plane.
I see.
Perhaps you might
consider it yourself.
Thank you, Squadron Leader,
and all of you.
I know you've done your best,
and nobody could have done more...
and I'm sorry.
As you've probably surmised,
Mallory...
I'm the bloody joker
they'd like to heave out at 10,000 feet.
I can't say I blame them.
I knew it was hopeless from the start,
but it had to be tried.
Anyway, this is why
you were hauled out of Crete.
And don't mislay this, will you?
No, sir.
Well, we're pressed for time.
Let's go, gentlemen, shall we?
- Any questions?
- Well, only one.
Why me?
What you want
is a seagoing taxi driver.
There must be a dozen men
who know these waters as well as I do.
Yes, but you've got
special qualifications.
Franklin will explain it to you.
It's all his idea anyway.
First, you speak Greek like a Greek
and German like a German.
Second, you've kept alive in occupied
territory for a year and a half.
But most important...
before the war you were the greatest
mountain climber in the world.
Keith Mallory, the human fly.
Come to the point.
The point is,
our Resistance contacts on Navarone...
say there's only one spot on the entire
coast the Germans don't bother watching.
That's the south cliff...
because it's 400 feet straight up
and it can't be climbed by man or beast.
That's where you come in.
- Oh, that was your idea too, was it?
- That's right.
I want you to get me and my team
over there and on top of that cliff.
After that, you can put your ship about
and take a richly deserved leave...
and a long-overdue promotion.
I see.
Can you do it?
With all due respect to Major Franklin,
I think the operation is insane.
But that's none of my business.
My business is the climb, and I haven't
done any climbing in five years.
That's a long time.
Too long for this cliff.
And you're asking me
to do it at night.
I wouldn't try it in broad daylight.
I'll have a go at it myself, then.
Don't be a fool.
Even with your luck, you'll
get yourself and your team killed.
Then it's scrubbed?
No, it's not scrubbed.
It can't be.
Not now.
This is our last hope.
The Germans won't expect us to throw in
a team of saboteurs at this late date.
Those 2,000 men on Kheros are
going to die next Wednesday morning...
unless somebody climbs that cliff.
There's nobody else we can get
in time.
If there were,
you wouldn't be here now.
I suppose it's too late to get
Andrea Stavrou out of Crete to help me.
On the contrary.
You'll find him waiting for you
in your hotel at this very moment.
You think of everything,
don't you, sir?
I have to.
It's part of my job.
- Thanks, Keith.
- It's my pleasure.
Nothing I like better
than a well-organized setup.
Now, you'll want to know some more
about the team.
Sidney, would you get us
some more coffee, please?
Franklin here considers it the best team
in the business; I'm inclined to agree.
He himself is ideal for the job.
He's experienced and extremely capable.
Don't blush, Roy.
And best of all, he's lucky.
Aren't you?
- If you say so, sir.
- I do indeed.
It was Napoleon who said, when somebody
was being promoted to general...
"Yes, yes, I know he's brilliant,
but is he lucky?"
The emperor knew the value of luck,
and our Roy seems to have it.
This is our Corporal Miller...
a professor of chemistry
in private life...
and an absolute genius
with high explosives.
He blew up Rommel's headquarters
in Tobruk...
without damaging a single window
of the orphanage next door.
They don't come any better. We tried to
promote him, but he just won't wear it.
This is Butcher Brown,
our mechanical marvel.
He's a genius with engines,
machinery, radios, et cetera.
He's also the best man with a knife
that I've ever met.
He got trained in the Spanish Civil War.
They call him the Butcher of Barcelona.
Private Spiro Pappadimos.
What's his particular genius?
He's a born killer, an extremely useful
man to have along on a job like this.
His father happens to be our
chief Resistance contact on Navarone.
The family sent him to America
ten years ago to get an education...
and I'm afraid
he got the wrong kind.
Well, there's the team.
Pirates and cutthroats,
every one of them.
And of course there's Lucky here,
and the redoubtable Mr. Stavrou...
and yourself.
With every one of us a genius,
how can we fail?
You can't.
We're sending six destroyers through
Navarone Channel Tuesday at midnight...
to take the men off Kheros.
If those guns aren't spiked by then...
there'll be six more ships
at the bottom of the Aegean.
There's your car, gentlemen.
Surprised?
I did not think
I would see you again so soon.
You thought
you'd have to look for me?
When the time came,
I would find you.
What is it?
We have to ferry some operators
to an island called Navarone.
- Do you know it?
- I know it.
I also know
I have work to do on Crete.
- Who's responsible for this?
- A major that I used to know.
Name of Franklin.
He's a man who still has
to prove to himself that he's a hero.
I will speak to this Franklin.
Where do I find him?
That's the man.
You can speak with him on the way.
Do you think they've got
any chance at all, sir?
Frankly, no.
Not a chance in the world.
I should be very surprised
if they get even halfway to Navarone.
It's just a waste of six good men.
However,
I suppose that doesn't matter...
considering how many
have been wasted already.
I'm glad it's not my decision.
I'm only the middle man.
Still, they may get there
and they may pull it off.
Anything can happen in a war.
Slap in the middle
of absolute insanity...
people pull out
the most extraordinary resources...
ingenuity, courage, self-sacrifice.
Pity we can't beat the problems of peace
in the same way.
It would be so much cheaper
for everybody.
I never thought of it
in just that way, sir.
- You're a philosopher, sir.
- No.
I'm just the man who has to send people
out on jobs like this one.
Must've been delayed, sir.
I'm sure he'll be here in a moment.
- Major Franklin?
- That's right.
My name's Baker. Sorry I was delayed.
Come along with me.
It's been so comfortable,
I hate to leave.
When you're all quite ready.
Charming.
Just like an English country hotel.
Where does everybody else sleep?
Nobody sleeps. On your feet.
We've got homework to do.
Well, if you insist, Major.
What are you doing, friend?
Looking for dust?
No, friend, microphones.
This is the British army post.
Don't you trust anyone?
No. That is why
I have lived so long.
Mr. Stavrou is Colonel Stavrou
of the Greek 19th Motorized Regiment.
He outranks us all.
The 19th Regiment no longer exists...
for the time being.
- I beg your pardon, Colonel.
- Andrea.
- Oh, please continue.
- Right.
If you're ready, Corporal.
Oh, yes, sir. Ready, sir.
Ready, willing and able, sir.
Champing at the very bit.
Captain Mallory and, uh, Andrea...
are responsible for getting us
to where we're going.
I'm going to tell you where we're going
and why we're going there.
That is, if you really
want to know, Professor.
I'm all ears, sir.
All ears.
We have to avoid the coast road.
That means a 12-mile trek across the
mountain to these ruins... St. Alexis...
where some of the Resistance people
from the town of Mandrakos...
will come and meet us,
if and when they can make it.
Any questions?
I have an alternate route to that place.
May I borrow your pencil, please?
Does the major
think this is possible?
I see.
That's a thought, isn't it?
Let's reexamine the plan...
and see if we have any alternative.
Watch out!
How long do you think
he's been out there?
I imagined I heard something
about ten minutes ago.
I thought my ears were playing tricks.
Then I heard it again.
Ten minutes, eh?
Brown, go and get Major Baker.
Well? What's your name?
What are you doing here?
The major asked you a question.
Answer the major.
Sounds like Kurdish.
I don't understand it.
I'll try Greek.
Translation, sir, please.
- He doesn't speak English.
- Then why was he listening?
- What are you doing to that man?
- Do you know him?
That's Nikolai, our laundry boy.
Is he the reason I've been disturbed?
Look, Franklin,
I've had a hard day.
Does his job involve
listening at keyholes?
- I don't believe it.
- We caught him.
Just idle curiosity, I'm sure.
He doesn't speak English.
Then why does he listen? Why carry a
knife? Why did he try and stab this man?
I presume he was trying
to defend himself.
In this part of the world, carrying a
knife doesn't mark a man as a criminal.
- You there, let him go.
- Major Baker.
Arrest this man and hold him
incommunicado for at least a week.
After that I don't care, but my advice
is you kick him out of Castelrosso.
Just who the hell are you
to give me advice, Major?
Then I'm asking you as a favor.
I'll consider it.
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.
I said, let him go!
Pappadimos, have you got your silencer?
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Then use it.
- Shoot the laundry boy.
- Are you crazy?
And if the major gets in your way,
shoot him too. That's an order.
Captain, this man's insane.
Surely you won't let him do this.
I can't stop him. He's in charge.
Anyway, I agree with him.
Of course,
he doesn't have to shoot you.
All he has to do is call our HQ
and you'll be on the first ship home...
as a private...
unless you give him your word
that you'll do exactly as he says.
All right. If it means that much to you,
you have my word.
Take him, Sergeant.
Stupid theatricals.
Well, you're entitled
to your opinion...
but I just saved your life.
I'm desperately sorry, gentlemen.
I mean, it's embarrassing.
Just look at it.
No, it's exactly what we want.
I know you wanted a boat that no one
would notice, but that's a disgrace.
Just give me 36 hours.
I know where I can lay my hands on
a German E-boat in perfect condition.
Only one careful owner. Say the word,
I'll pop over to Rhodes and get it.
Rhodes? Won't the Germans
have something to say about that?
I suppose they would if they knew, but
I've got some good connections there.
- What do you say?
- No, thanks.
- We can't wait.
- Pity.
Well, I'll get a couple of my chaps
to give yours a hand with your gear.
No, that's all right, thank you.
Right. I get it.
Special cargo and all that, what?
Well, good luck to you.
Brown?
- Yes, sir?
- What do you think?
She's a bit of a monster, sir,
but I think I've got her worried.
Comfortable, Professor?
Yes, thank you.
The boys have almost finished.
- Permission to speak?
- What about?
Well, the condition of this vessel.
Talk to Captain Mallory about that.
He's in charge of transportation.
Very good, sir.
I've inspected this boat,
and you ought to know that...
I can't swim.
I'll keep it in mind.
Dead on ten, sir.
Hello, Lucky.
Hello, Lucky.
Report by signal.
Report by signal.
Hello, George Mike William.
Hello, George Mike William.
Strength three.
Strength three. Over.
Hello, Lucky.
High Flight reports Indians on warpath
in your territory...
so please be careful.
Also, severe storms expected
throughout your area tonight.
Repeat...
Ship ahoy!
Go on working.
They'll have glasses.
Lower your sails!
Lower your sails!
We are coming aboard!
It's knee-deep in the hold,
but I should think we'll manage.
- You want a breather?
- Wouldn't mind.
Funny the way that German officer
kept speaking English to us back there.
Almost as if he knew who we were.
Yes, I had the same thought.
I think our friend Baker
may have some explaining to do.
- I shouldn't have done it.
- What's that?
Dragged you into this.
I'm sorry.
Forget it. I was getting tired
of Crete food anyway.
No, I'm stupid sometimes.
Even as a kid, I took it for granted
people wanted to play the games I liked.
I'd get furious when they didn't.
And now they have to.
So why worry?
- Hot coffee.
- Oh, that's good.
Sorry, Captain. There's a serious
shortage of cups aboard this ship.
Remember, I did point out
certain deficiencies in this vessel.
I remember.
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.
Any time you want another chat, sir...
about this boat, I mean...
I'm available.
Right.
And I still can't swim.
Don't mind him.
He doesn't mean anything.
I don't mind him
as much as he seems to mind me.
- Have you been together long?
- Since the beginning out here.
He's the best friend I have
in this part of the world.
That's a pretty good partner
you've got there yourself.
Yes.
- We've been together a long time too.
- You're lucky.
He's going to kill me
when the war is over.
You're not serious.
Yes, I am.
So is he.
About a year ago
I gave a German patrol a safe conduct...
to get some of their wounded
into hospital.
Still had some romantic notions in those
days about fighting a civilized war.
Anyway, they wanted Andrea
pretty badly even then.
They shot their casualties,
went to his house and blew it up.
He was out on a job, but his wife
and three children were in the house.
They were all killed.
I helped him to bury them.
He didn't say a word to me.
Never looked at me.
But after it was over he turned to me
and said as far as he was concerned...
it wasn't the Germans
who were responsible, but me.
Me and my stupid Anglo-Saxon decency.
Then he told me
what he was going to do, and when.
Do you think he still means to do it?
He's from Crete.
Those people don't make idle threats.
When I thought I was getting leave...
I was going to ask for transfer
to another area.
Some time to think,
get ready for it.
And I messed that up.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
It's gonna be a long war.
What makes you sure
he's gonna wait that long?
Well, I'm not,
not if he gets the right opportunity.
What I'm banking on is that right now
all he wants to do is to kill Germans.
As long as I can be useful to him
in that department...
he'll do his best to keep me alive.
I hope.
That's nice of him.
Well, I can see his point.
The only way to win a war
is to be just as nasty as the enemy.
Only we might wake up one day and find
out we're even nastier than they are.
- I can't say that worries me.
- Well, you're lucky.
Think I'd better have a look
at the hold...
before Miller tells me to.
Help!
Well, we saved the explosives...
the guns, and most of the ammunition.
I'm afraid we've lost
the food and the medical supplies.
But if we make our rendezvous
with the Resistance at St. Alexis...
they should be able to
supply us with both.
Let's get out of this place
as quickly as we can.
Pappadimos and Miller...
you'll have the first shift
with the stretcher.
You're officially taking command
of this team, sir?
Yes, I suppose I am. Why?
Just for the record.
This afternoon on the boat...
you fumbled your job.
How did that happen?
I don't know, sir.
The man was a foot away from you with
his back turned. You only wounded him.
How could you miss?
I must have hesitated, sir.
You hesitated?
A man of your experience?
The Butcher of Barcelona?
How could you hesitate?
Then I was tired.
I'm tired and I'm fed up.
I've been fighting this war
a long time.
I've been killing Germans since 1937.
There's no end to them.
You shoot a man at 200 yards,
he's just a moving target.
You kill him with a knife,
you're close enough to smell him.
I smell them in my sleep.
After the last time,
I made a pact with myself.
I'd do my job...
but I wouldn't do
the other anymore.
Not if I could help it.
Who gave you the right
to make a private peace?
You think you're the only one
who's tired?
- I do my job, sir.
- Your job is to kill enemy soldiers.
There will, of course,
be a code word.
If we don't answer it,
there'll be a patrol up here in no time.
Let's pack the gear
and get out of here.
Let's go.
Well?
The major's leg is broken
in two places.
For all we know, he's hurt inside too.
He needs proper medical attention.
What do you suggest?
If we leave him here,
the Germans will take care of him.
They'd get him to a hospital.
If he doesn't get sulfanilamide
for his leg, he doesn't stand a chance.
Naturally, you all think a lot
of Major Franklin. So do I.
We have two choices.
Take him with us, and if
he doesn't get help soon, he'll die.
Or we can leave him here, in which case
he'll tell the Germans everything.
Roy? Never!
He might not be able to help himself.
They have other drugs besides sulfa.
All they have to do is to shoot him
full of Scopolamine...
and he'll tell them
our whole plan in detail.
There is, of course,
a third choice.
One bullet now.
Better for him,
better for us.
You take that man along,
you endanger us all.
Why don't we just drop him
off the cliff and save a bullet?
And why don't you shut up?
Yes, there's a third choice.
We'll make it if necessary...
when it's necessary...
and not before!
Now, let's get moving.
From now on, your job is
to look after Major Franklin.
I said move!
Morning.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
It's just bad luck.
What do we do now?
- Where are we?
- We're on our way.
- I'm going to hold you up.
- No, you won't.
Anyway, the professor here won the toss,
and he's just dying to carry you.
- Aren't you, Professor?
- That's right.
You're nowhere near as heavy
as I thought you were.
Now, look...
you've got to leave me.
You're out of your mind.
It's radio time.
Well, it's all on your plate now.
You'll never be able
to thank me enough, will you?
I wanted the job all the time.
Hello, Lucky.
Report by signal.
Hello, George Mike William.
Strength four. Over.
Hello, Lucky.
This is most urgent.
Paddington Station will close
at midnight x-minus-one.
Do you understand?
X-minus-one.
Over.
We've lost a full day.
Germans are going to hit Kheros
a day ahead of time.
Gives us until midnight
the day after tomorrow.
Message understood.
Over and out.
I'd like to be alone
with the major.
Roy, that was foolish.
You almost ruined everything.
We just heard from headquarters.
We're cancelled out.
- Scrubbed.
- What?
They're going for
an amphibious landing...
the day after tomorrow
on the east coast.
The Turkish side.
And they're coming in force.
As far as we're concerned,
the pressure's off.
All we have to do is
make as much trouble as we can.
By tonight, we'll have you
in the hands of the underground.
We'll have you taken care of.
You try this again,
I'll have Andrea break your other leg.
Good luck.
Do not worry.
I shall see you tonight
at St. Alexis.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Obviously, this place
has been used before.
Any food around?
I regret to say no.
Weren't you a little careless just now?
We might have been anyone.
Oh, no, no. I heard you coming
five minutes ago.
It's time to relieve Andrea.
- I'll take it.
- No.
Pappadimos, you go.
- Maybe he brought us some food.
- Hold it.
He might be faking.
Saved.
Don't move!
Raise your hands.
Raise your hands high.
All of you.
You there, with the food, speak!
You are not Germans.
Which of you is Major Franklin?
The man on the stretcher.
Who are you?
My name is Maria Pappadimos.
You may put your hands down now.
- They told us Pappadimos was a man.
- My father. He was taken two days ago.
He was taken?
He told them nothing.
He will die first.
- You have any sisters or brothers?
- I have a brother, Spiro, in America.
He's not that far away.
He's that handsome devil
right over there.
What did you do that for?
To remind you
to write letters occasionally.
- There happens to be a war on.
- I mean before the war!
I promised myself I would do this
the first time I saw you again.
Well, I'm sorry, brother.
Which of you did this?
I'm afraid it was me.
- Who is she?
- She's my friend Anna. She's one of us.
It's bad that this happened to her.
Before the Germans came,
she was a schoolteacher in Mandrakos.
Last year she was caught.
They tortured her
to make her betray us.
They whipped her
until the white of her bones showed.
Some nights,
we could hear her screaming.
Then they took her to the fortress,
and they kept her there for six months.
When they let her go...
she could not speak.
She has never spoken since,
not even in her dreams.
Even I have never been allowed
to see the scars on her back.
But she's a good fighter...
as good as any of you.
She's like a ghost.
She goes anywhere.
She got us these guns,
and she kills without mercy.
You are very lucky, brother.
No, they're friends!
Our friends!
It's gangrene, sir.
If the major's leg doesn't come off,
he's gonna die.
Does he know?
I don't think so.
Sir?
Beg pardon, sir, but this is the first
chance I've had to talk to you alone.
I don't want to be left out anymore.
I want to be part of the team again.
Please give me a chance.
You can trust me.
I'll think it over.
That's gangrene.
What choice do we have now, Captain?
- Who relieved you?
- She did.
- In future, take orders only from me.
- Yes, sir.
