Roberto!
You promised.
- Adios, Kashkin.
- Adios, Roberto.
Oh, hola, Americano.
- Hello.
- Hola, amigo.
Get back!
- Help yourself, Jordan.
- General Golz!
What an accent.
He even knows me
in the dark.
That's all we have in Spain now:
Accents. Eh, Jordan?
Yes, I was looking for you
when the lights went out.
I saw you.
How did it go? The train.
- All right.
- Mm-hmm. And, uh, Kashkin?
- He caught one.
- Huh?
- He didn't want to be taken alive.
- Oh.
- So it was like that.
- Yes. Murder.
- Orders are orders.
- I still say it was murder.
Well, in this business,
Jordan, remember nothing.
Nothing except
the next job.
- What's next?
- A bridge.
- Oh, a bridge.
- Right. To blow the bridge is nothing.
But to blow it at the stated hour
and the time set for the attack,
that's a horse of another color,
as you Americans say.
- Attack?
- Yes. At last we take the offensive.
Oh, it will be beautiful attack.
On paper it looks wonderful.
And if it succeeds...
No, I will not say "if."
This time, it must succeed,
and it will.
What I've told you,
Jordan,
is known only to
the General's staff.
Our only chance to succeed
is by a surprise attack.
Now, here's the bridge,
over a deep gorge.
It's the only way the enemy
can bring up reinforcements.
Tanks, artillery, troops...
all must come over this bridge.
I must know absolutely
it is gone.
Not before the attack.
They'd rebuild it.
It must go the minute the attack starts.
No sooner, no later.
So, the bridge is nothing.
But suppose their soldiers are sitting
on it when it's time to blow it.
You know, sentries on both ends.
What do you do then?
In our country, General, they say
never blow a bridge 'til you come to it.
Good.
That's good.
You joke. In this business,
one should joke a little.
I am so serious.
It's why I can joke.
- You think you can get through
the enemy lines tomorrow night?
- Sure.
Good. That will give you three days
to prepare for the dynamiting.
Wait for the attack at dawn,
after the third night.
Mm-hmm. How will I know
the exact time?
Well, use these. Listen.
First, we attack from the air.
When our planes fly over, you'll hear
the explosions. That's your time.
Oh, uh, I've got a good guide for you:
An old man named Anselmo.
But good. Knows the country like a fox,
and, uh, the people to help you.
Now go and find yourself
a pretty girl.
- But first, get a haircut.
- Is that an order, General?
- Why not?
- I don't like your barber.
Up the gorge to the left
is the bridge.
- Sentry boxes, huh?
- At each end, Roberto.
Always two sentries
on guard.
Where do
the sentries live?
At the roadmender's hut,
across the bridge.
You can't see it
from here.
The other post is on this side,
in that old sawmill.
- How many men at the sawmill?
- Eight and the corporal.
The other post...
how many men?
Maybe more.
We'll find out. Look!
They always spit
in the gorge.
It brings luck.
I wish I could
spit that far.
- Roberto.
- Hmm?
That sentry... He looks like
a man from my village.
He's very young.
He must die?
You couldn't do it,
Anselmo?
I would kill
the sentry, yes,
considering the necessity
of the bridge.
But if I live later,
I'll try to live in such a way,
doing no harm to anyone,
that it will be forgiven.
Come on. Let's get this dynamite
where it'll be safe.
- You wait here, Roberto.
- Oh, I can make it, Anselmo.
You want to be shot at
carrying these?
No, not even in a joke.
Go ahead.
Roberto.
He's the boss here, Roberto.
Very strong man.
- I can see.
- Foreigner.
And a friend.
Didn't the old man tell you?
I'm asking you.
I'm here for the republic.
You know those seals, don't you?
S.I.M.,
Service of Military Intelligence.
This is the seal of the General's staff.
They command for the republic.
In these mountains,
I command. No one else.
- What's that?
- Dynamite.
Good.
I can use dynamite.
- How much you bring me?
- None.
- What's your name?
- What's that to you?
Pablo.
He's Pablo.
- What for?
- A bridge.
- What bridge?
- That's my business.
- In this country, foreigner,
it's my business.
- Is that the way to talk?
- Do you want to die?
- No.
- Shut your mouth.
- But didn't you hear
what this comrade said?
- He comes for the republic!
- Anselmo.
Help us get this stuff up to your camp,
will you? The old man's tired.
Hola.
What is it that comes?
The old man
and the dynamiter.
Hey, that, that stuff.
Not in the cave.
- What are you making?
- A trap for foxes.
See? Very practical.
He catches rabbits. If a gypsy
catches rabbits, he says it's foxes.
If he catches a fox,
he would call it an elephant.
- And if I catch an elephant?
- You'd say it was a tank.
I'll get me a tank, old man.
Someday I'll get me a tank,
and you can call it what you please.
Gypsies talk much,
kill little.
- I'm going for wine.
- Bring a cup for me.
- Hey, you have wine, huh?
- And plenty of it.
- We eat like generals here.
- He eats like ten generals.
- What do gypsies do in the war?
- They keep on being gypsies.
- Well, that's a good job.
- The best.
- How do they call you?
- Roberto. And you?
Rafael. Oh, wine!
- There will be food soon.
- Food!
You have tobacco, huh?
Yeah. I know these.
Much air and little tobacco.
Ah, we eat!
- Hola.
- Hola.
That's the way I comb it.
Go ahead and eat.
Hey. Bread.
How are you called?
Maria.
And you?
Roberto.
Been here long?
This long.
Three months.
They shaved my head
in Valladolid.
I was on the train.
They were taking me south.
- The train Pablo blew at Talavera.
- Yeah.
Many of the prisoners were
caught again, but they saved me.
They and Pilar.
We found her hiding
in the rock...
where she'd run
from the train.
You should have seen her
when we brought her here.
No hair at all!
Cried all the time,
and if anyone touch her,
she'd shiver
like a wet dog.
Man, but she was ugly.
God's truth, Roberto,
though gypsies usually lie.
She looked like
a half-drowned kitten.
Hey.
- You blow trains?
- I have.
- Here?
- No, in Estremadura.
In another six months,
it'll grow out.
Are you, uh, his woman?
Pablo's?
You've seen Pablo.
- I've seen Rafael too.
- No.
No, not the gypsy.
This is a very strange woman, Roberto.
Is of no one.
But she cooks well.
Really? No one?
No one.
No one.
Nor of you, either.
No.
No, I have no time for women.
No?
Maria. Maria!
Who's that?
Pablo's woman,
Pilar.
She's something barbarous,
but brave! Wah!
- Hundred times braver than Pablo.
- Pablo was brave in the beginning.
Sure. He killed more people
than the cholera.
At the start of the movement, he killed
more people than the bubonic plague.
But Pilar...
she's something barbarous!
- Mmm!
- Gypsy's afraid of her.
Why not? She has
a strong hatred for me.
- Why?
- She treats me as a time waster.
- She doesn't like gypsies.
- What an injustice.
She has gypsy blood herself.
She knows of what she speaks.
But she has a tongue.
It bites like a bull whip!
What are you saying now,
you lazy, unspeakable son
of an unmentionable gypsy?
Answer me, gypsy.
I was telling this comrade
what a kind woman you are, Pilar.
- Liar!
- This one comes as a dynamiter.
I know that. Relieve Andres.
He's on guard at the top.
I go, Pilar. I go.
I'll see you, Roberto,
at the hour of eating.
Not even in a joke!
Three times today you've eaten.
- And I can eat twice more.
- Get out of here.
- And send me Andres.
- Eh.
- Hola, Ingles. How are you,
and how's everything in the republic?
- Good.
- Both good.
- I'm happy.
What was that gypsy
saying about me?
He said you were much woman.
And I'd say he's right.
And what were you saying
to the girl before I came out?
- Mmm, nothing.
- I saw how she was from seeing you.
- I only joked with her.
- Jokes.
Listen to me, Ingles.
She's young.
Not hardened as we are.
And she's had a bad time, the worst time
a woman can have, you understand?
- Yes, I guess so.
- I'm worried about her.
When do you leave here?
In three days...
if I'm still alive.
What made you say that?
That way of speaking never brings luck.
Let me see your hand.
Well?
Nothing.
I saw nothing.
What you come for?
Blow another train?
No, a bridge.
All the better.
Now we have causes.
Let's blow all the bridges and get out.
I'm sick of this place.
We are all rotting here
because there is no fighting.
Nothing to do but
watch Pablo get drunk.
This life is ruining him.
- Tell me, what did you see in my hand?
- I saw nothing.
Yes, you did.
I'm only curious, Pilar.
I don't believe in such things.
- In what do you believe?
- In my work.
- I saw that.
- What else?
Nothing else. A bridge
is very difficult, you said.
- No, I said it was important.
- But it can be very difficult.
Yes. I'm going back there
to look it over again.
- How many men have you got here?
- Five that are good.
The gypsy's worthless,
although his intentions are good.
Pablo I no longer trust.
Thanks. I like
your way of speaking.
I try to speak frankly.
- Then tell me what you saw in my hand.
- No.
I saw nothing else.
Go now to the bridge.
I look after your equipment.
Let me tell you again, Ingles.
I'm glad you've come.
We will understand each other.
Are they not well outside?
I don't want dynamite in here.
We have fire.
It's far from the fire.
Smoke?
How goes it, gypsy?
- Is she gonna let you eat again?
- Why not?
Is there wine?
Not much left.
Well, in that case,
I'll have a cup of water.
Maria, is there any water left?
It's too strong
or I'd give you some.
I'd offer it to you, Pablo,
but there's not much left.
- I have wine.
- What drink is that?
Medicine.
Wanna taste it?
- What's it for?
- It changes your ideas.
Yeah?
Bitter as gall!
I'd rather be sick
than have that medicine.
That's the wormwood. I'm glad you don't
like it because there's not much left.
What are you saying there?
I was explaining
the medicine.
Maria.
- What's that?
- The bridge.
Showing the construction.
Look how it seems.
Why, that's
the bridge itself.
- How do you blow up bridge?
- That's what I'm figuring out.
No!
I don't go
for the bridge.
Neither me nor my people.
Then we'll do it alone.
Old one?
Yes.
Without this coward.
Hey, you.
What did you say?
Nothing for you.
I spoke to Roberto.
My orders are
to blow the bridge.
And I say no.
In these mountains, we hide.
My business is to take care of
my people, and I-I know my business.
Live one place.
Fight somewhere else.
Fight, raid, blow trains, bridges,
but a way off.
Not here where
they will hunt us.
You'll clear out. Get away
to the Gredos. You've got horses.
I have five horses
and eight people!
You and the old man
with the loud mouth make ten.
Now if this bridge is blown,
we will be hunted.
Hunted from the earth,
from the air.
Yeah. Explosions
will fall from the sky...
on my horses.
Until you had horses,
you were one of us.
Now you're rich with horses.
You want to retire.
A lie. You no expose the horses
for the cause.
To eat well, yes.
To steal, yes.
To murder, yes.
To fight for the republic, no.
You're an old man who will
make trouble with his mouth.
I'm an old man
not afraid to fight.
I'm an old man
without horses.
You're an old man
who might not live long.
I'm an old man
who will live until I die.
You will blow
no bridge here.
- No?
- No.
No bridge.
Pilar.
- What do you say?
- I am for the bridge.
And for the republic.
What's that, woman?
I am for the bridge
and against you, nothing more.
What you say, Primitivo?
I am also for the bridge.
- Fernando?
- To me, the bridge means nothing.
I'm for the woman of Pablo.
- Andres?
- Yes, equally.
The same, Pilar.
Then we blow the bridge and retreat
to the Gredos afterwards.
You with your head of a bull
and your heart of a hog.
You think there will be
any afterwards from this bridge?
I am for the republic,
and the republic is a bridge.
It means nothing, huh? Nothing,
then, to be hunted like a beast...
after this thing
which brings no profit.
Everyone to die for it?
Don't try to
frighten us, coward.
Coward? Is it cowardly
to know what's foolish?
Or am I a leader
for nothing?
Haven't I brought you all alive
through a year of this war?
This foreigner comes here to do a thing
for the good of the foreigners.
And for his good,
you want to sacrifice us.
I'm for the good
and safety of all.
Safety. Huh!
There is no such thing
as safety.
Did I spend nine years with
the worst-paid matadors of the world...
not to learn about fear
and about safety?
Speak to me of anything
but safety.
Look at him.
How I believed in him once.
And look what he is now.
From one year of war, you've
become lazy, a drunkard and a coward.
Woman, you have no right
to speak in that way,
not before my people
and the stranger.
Do you still believe
you command here?
Yes.
Here, I command.
Here, I command.
Haven't you heard them?
Here, no one commands
but me now.
I should shoot you
and the foreigner both.
Try it and see what happens.
Listen to me, drunkard.
You understand now who commands?
- Why, I command.
- No. Listen.
Take the wax
from your ears.
Listen well.
I command.
All right.
All right!
You command.
And if you want, he...
he can command too.
Maybe I am lazy
and drink too much.
Maybe you think
I'm a coward,
though you know better.
Maybe, but I'm not stupid.
Now if you're a woman as well as
a commander, show us something to eat.
Maria.
Take the food.
- You must be careful.
- Pablo?
If you sleep, yes.
I'll keep an eye open.
What's he doing?
Only drinking. There'll be danger
if he begins to hide the sadness.
If he pretends to be friendly,
it'll mean he's made a decision.
I heard Pilar say it.
What kind of decision?
Who knows? After what's happened,
it would mean great danger for you.
I'll look after myself.
I'm thinking about the bridge.
I'm thinking
about you, Roberto.
Why, Maria?
Well, I don't know.
Did I muss it?
All day I wanted you
to do that.
I, too, Maria.
Where is Pablo?
Aha. He's gone
to the horses.
Now you have to kill him. Why don't
you kill him before he kills you?
He won't kill me.
We waited for you to kill him.
Why didn't you?
And turn Pilar against me? Without
the woman, there's no control here.
So he takes the horses and goes.
What about your bridge then?
Ah, you don't know Pablo.
Now, man, you have
tightened your garters.
You, my friend.
You know I'm not a coward.
Yeah.
You are no woman,
no fool.
No.
Nor any colt
of a girl either...
that makes a man
crazy with hunger.
You don't lie, make insults
and leave me like my people.
Yes. Yes, eat.
Eat, my friend.
Pay no attention to the woman.
You know who commands.
You and me,
we'll show them who's stupid.
Not me.
Not you, my friend.
Get out of sight!
- Ours?
- German and Italian.
- Huh? Can they see the horses?
- They're not looking for horses.
Man, I could see their faces.
I spit in their faces.
I spit in the milk
of their mothers.
I tell you... I tell you
they could see the horses.
Wipe the sweat from your face.
They could see the cigarette butts.
Huh?
- Hey, wait! They may be back!
- Coward!
Go to your horses.
- Have you seen planes like this before?
- Never, Ingles.
Get inside.
I'm going with Pilar to the camp of
El Sordo. We've got to have more horses.
You know your sentry posts.
Keep a close watch.
Anselmo,
I want you to write down everything
that passes along the road.
I can't write, Roberto.
I'll show you how to write.
Look how Roberto
can make pictures.
That... That's a truck.
See?
And here's a soldier on a horse.
Look! A tank!
I will catch me
a tank like that!
Whatever passes,
make a mark.
The man on the horse
is for cavalry.
Each mark will mean a troop
of 20 mounted men. Understand?
Each troop, a mark.
In this way,
I can write. Yes.
That's an educated pencil!
One paper is for movement up the road,
the other for movement down the road.
When you get back tonight, I'll know
what they're moving up to the front.
Better get along,
and take some food with you.
Can I write too? Huh?
I want you to watch the bridge
and the two sentry posts.
See if more soldiers are brought and
at what intervals the guard is changed.
What... What is "intervals"?
How many hours the sentries stay on
and at what time changes are made.
Yeah.
- Without a watch?
- Take mine.
Oh!
What a watch!
Look at what a complication.
- Such a watch should be able
to read and write.
- Don't fool with it.
- Can you tell time?
- Why not?
With luck.
You don't need to be a clown.
Do what I tell you
and keep out of sight.
Salud, gypsy.
Did you see the air machines?
See them?
We ate them
for breakfast.
Is there food, Pilar? I'm hungry.
It's a long walk
from La Granja.
La Granja?
Yes, Roberto.
You wish tobacco?
- You?
- Didn't you sleep here last night?
For a while, yes.
Then I thought of my woman
and children in La Granja.
- Then I went to La Granja.
- Wasn't that dangerous?
Eh, it's all a matter of
getting past their sentries.
That's why
I only go at night.
Oh, Maria.
See much movement along
the road last night?
Nothing.
A few trucks, as usual.
Cars.
A few guns, as usual.
- No troops.
- Pick up any news in town?
But nothing.
Oh...
It still goes badly in the north.
That's not news.
Oh, yes, there is talk that
the republic is preparing an attack.
- That what?
- That we are preparing an offensive.
- Where?
- Perhaps here.
Perhaps near Navacerrada.
- Have you heard of it?
- Where's that talk come from?
Where?
Surely you know how rumors fly.
The officers talk in the cafes,
and the waiters listen.
The rumors come running.
They say this is
an offensive of some size,
but, uh, it's only a rumor.
What else did you hear?
Nothing, man.
Uh, just...
there is some talk...
that the republicans will try
to blow the bridges, but...
Are you joking?
This one
doesn't joke, Ingles.
Bad luck he doesn't.
A man like me is never
alarmed by rumors, Pilar.
- Remember anything more?
- No.
Oh, they talk as usual of soldiers to be
sent to clean us out of these mountains.
There is some talk troops are on the
way, but they always talk like that.
Is not to give
any importance to.
Only rumors as usual.
Mmmm, rumors.
Everything as usual.
Things are bad
in the north, as usual.
The troops come
to hunt us out, as usual.
An offensive here,
as usual.
Man, you are a monument
to "as usual."
But the last two, Pilar,
are only rumor.
My mother!
Let's go, Pilar.
Who'll look after my things?
The man of rumors. Remain here,
Fernando, and guard the explosives.
Very well, Pilar.
Calm yourself.
There is nothing to worry about.
Only rumors.
Wait.
Hello, Maria.
Hello, Roberto.
Ingles.
- Hola, Pilar.
- Hola.
- Hola, Joaquin.
- Hola, Maria.
Tell El Sordo
I am coming with Ingles.
A good boy, Ingles.
El Sordo saved him
when his family was killed,
and now they are like
father and son.
Ingles, tell me.
Have you known many women?
- They meant nothing.
- I think you lie.
Well, maybe, a little.
And for this one?
For Maria, you care much?
Let's get on.
What is the reason
for the bridge, Ingles?
Is there gonna be an attack?
And the airplanes this morning.
Does that mean the enemy's found out?
They're preparing a counterattack?
- I only know one thing for certain.
- What's that?
- You have to shout.
- I only know one thing for certain.
The bridge has got to go
when the attack starts.
To do that, we've got to have more
horses and more men, if we can get them.
When do we blow it?
Day after...
Day after tomorrow.
- Why not tonight?
- Orders.
- How do you get whiskey?
- Make it.
No, no, no. I joke.
This is good whiskey.
We got it on a raid.
No ice.
Plenty ice up there.
Too far.
Easier blow the bridge
tonight.
I'd be shot for it.
Do it in daylight
and we may all be shot for it.
- Not if we have horses.
- Hmm?
Not if we have enough horses.
We'll get out of here quickly
before the soldiers come after us.
I have five horses
and four men.
Five men, Sordo.
So it is.
Five with the boy.
Five men
and five horses.
- That's ten horses for 15 people.
- Mmm.
We've got to have
five more horses.
For the retreat, yes. No one
will get out alive without a horse.
- How can you get horses?
- Steal 'em.
Only soldiers
have horses now.
Soldiers and thieves like us.
- Can you get five more tonight?
- When?
Tonight.
We can try.
- Good.
- Maybe not so good.
Not good if it snows.
Horses make tracks,
and soldiers follow tracks.
- It is too late for snow, Sordo.
- Hmm?
It's the month of May.
And the sun is shining.
Look at the young general.
Already he's stealing horses.
He's always talking, Pilar, how
he's carried the girl from the train.
- Yeah.
- Let's see you carry her...
down the hill, my boy.
Now you make fun of me.
Wait, Joaquin!
I'll carry you on my shoulders!
