- Here's your truck back.
Oh, hell, I hope
he didn't break an axle.
I wouldn't want
to take advantage of you.

- I'm not gonna wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.
-
- You tryin' to look like a prince ?
- What do you mean "trying" ?
You should've done that
a long time ago.
- That way, it would've set.
- I know.
- Then why didn't you do it ?
- 'Cause I forgot.
-
-  Oh, man.
Steven's gettin' married
in a couple of hours.
We're talkin' about huntin'
the last time before the army.
The whole thing, it's crazy.
I'll tell ya one thing.
If I found out my life
had to end up in the mountains,
I'd be all right.
But it has to be
in your mind.
What ?
One shot ?
Two is pussy.
I don't think about one shot
that much anymore, Mike.
You have to think about one shot.
One shot is what it's all about.
A deer has to be taken
with one shot.
I try to tell people that.
They don't listen.
- You really think about Vietnam ?
- Yeah.
I don't know. I guess.
I'm thinkin' about the deer.
Going to Nam.
I like the trees, you know ?
I like the way the trees
are in the mountains,
all the different--
The way the trees are.
I sound like
some asshole, right ?
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy
I go huntin' with, you know ?
I like a guy with quick moves and speed.
I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes.
- Well, who's an asshole ?
- Who's an asshole ?
Who do you think's
an asshole ?
They're all a bunch of assholes.
I mean, I love 'em. They're great guys,
but without you, I'd hunt alone.
- Seriously, that's what I'd do.
- Well, you're a fuckin' nut.
You know that, Mike.
You're a maniac, control freak.
I just don't like
no surprises.
- Damn thing won't open.
- Well, give it a kick.
Hey, man, hey, hey,
not like that. Not--
Here, here, here.
- See that ?
- Fuckin' A.
Unreal.
Axel, now I know why you're not
still kicking for the Steelers.
You know, I love Mike's car.
Yeah, some cars, they just sit.
You never know with a car like this
where the hell it's gonna take you.
Yeah.
It makes me feel safe.
- **
-

- Oh, what is he doing ?
Axel's humping
Mike's Coupe de Ville.
- Axel, get out of there.
- Let's get the carnations.
Get up. Get up.
What are you doing ?
Come on. Sit up.
Oh, God, you're impossible.
- Here, put this on.
You have to have that on.
- Crummy tuxedo.
-
- Tuxedo's been stuck a million times.
- Where'd you get this thing ?
It's not funny.
- Fuckin' A.
- I'm beautiful, right ? I'm beautiful.
- No, you're not.
- All set.
- Thanks, Amy.
You can't even
sit up, Axel. Oh !
- Axel, come on. Sit up.
You can't even sit up.

Linda, what's the matter ?
I was gonna pick you up.
Hi.
- What's the matter ?
- He hit me.
Hey, come here, come here.
I wanna ask you something.
Hey, wait a minute,

- Nick ?
- You don't walk away from me.
What is that on your face ?
Nicky, you and Michael,
you're goin' away in a couple of days.
I was just wonderin'
if I could use this place to stay.
- Oh, sure.
- I'd wanna pay you both.
- And I was thinking--
- What are you talkin' about ?
I would wanna
pay you, Nick.
-
- Hey, Kochatka,

- You know, how long
have you known me for ?

it's good luck
for the rest of your life.

Great. That's great.
That's my last one true secret.
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Just forget about it.
