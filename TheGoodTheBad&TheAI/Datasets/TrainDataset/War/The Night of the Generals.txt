MAN:
Take cover!
There's some more, over there!
Back up, around the other way.
What's the odd smell
in this house, inspector?
The smell of war,
Major Grau.
Good morning, inspector.
Major.
I'm sorry to call you
at such an ungodly hour.
Not very nice, I'm afraid.
The work of an amateur
butcher, I should say.
Why have you called me?
The dead woman's Polish,
isn't she?
This is not a case
for the German authorities.
Her name was Kupiecka.
Maria Kupiecka.
Kupiecka?
Oh, yes, she was a prostitute
and a good friend to us.
She was also a German agent.
Killed by a Polish patriot?
Providing the Polish patriot
was also a sexual degenerate.
Patriotism has been known
to have its vicious side.
One hundred knife wounds
goes beyond normal patriotic zeal.
One hundred?
That's just my guess, sir.
It would be impossible
to count.
As you can see, the focus
of the murderer's attack
was on the woman's
sexual organs,
using what appears to have been
a large clasp knife...
Thank you, doctor,
there's no need to be vivid.
Find anything?
No, not yet.
Who reported the murder?
A voice on the telephone.
A man. He heard screams
at about 11: 10.
Identify himself?
No.
Who lives in this house?
One of you...
One of you heard a scream
and telephoned the police.
One of you knows something about
the way in which this woman died.
If that person does not tell us
everything he knows,
we shall assume
that her death was political.
That she was killed by a member
of the Polish underground
and that you are all
accomplices.
In which case,
it will be my sad duty
to turn the whole lot of you
over to the Gestapo.
The man who
telephoned the police
has one minute in which
to make himself known.
I heard the scream.
This one terrible scream.
And then, well, I...
I hid in the lavatory.
Then later,
perhaps 10 minutes later,
I telephoned the police.
That's all.
You did not give
the police your name.
That means that there was something
you didn't want them to know.
What could that something be?
Well, there's a...
There's this crack in the door
to the lavatory.
And naturally, you put your eye
to the crack and you saw...?
I saw a man
coming down the stairs.
Describe him, please.
Well, it... It was dark.
Describe him, please.
I couldn't see all of him.
Just the lower part,
the trousers.
Why are you so frightened
by what you saw?
Because it was a uniform, sir.
Like yours.
Like mine?
A German officer?
The man's a liar.
German officers can commit
murders like anyone else.
Is that all you noticed?
That the trousers were like mine?
Exactly like mine?
No.
Not exactly, sir. No.
There was a...
There was a red stripe
running down the leg.
He's lying.
Are you aware that only German
generals wear the red stripe?
Yes, sir. That's why I was afraid.
I see.
It's impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
A German general.
Well, well.
I don't think we need to take
this testimony too seriously.
After all, it was dark on the stairs.
Sir, I swear...
I swear, I'm telling the truth.
And I believe you, until
there's evidence to the contrary.
Why would he tell a dangerous lie?
I want a complete investigation.
But what happens if
the murderer really is a general?
What happens? Well, justice
is blind, my dear inspector.
Justice cannot see
the red stripe or the gold braid,
but justice can sometimes
hear the cry of a murdered woman.
If a general is responsible,
why, we shall have to hang him.
Don't worry, Liesowski,
the responsibility is mine.
Good night.
LIESOWSKI: Well, Inspector
Morand, you can't blame me
for not quite remembering a case that
occurred almost a generation ago.
But as they say,
it's the long arm of the law.
It's... It's 23 years ago.
My God, how time passes.
When I left the police,
right after the war
I managed to keep
some of my files.
Always glad to help a colleague.
Ah, here we are, inspector.
"Kupiecka, Maria.
Murdered. Unsolved. "
The suspects were...
Oh, yes. Yes, now I remember.
A German general was seen
allegedly leaving her room.
And of all the generals in Warsaw,
only three had no alibis
for the night in question.
SOLDIER:
Ready for inspection, sir.
General Gabler, a message.
Yes?
A message from General Tanz, sir.
Thank you, Fräulein Neumaier.
It seems we have failed
to keep proper order in the city.
You have read it?
Oh, yes.
And because
of our notorious incompetence...
Incompetence?
They don't realize that
this is a garrison post,
that I am given only the
dregs of the army, the misfits.
Well, that was General Tanz's word.
"Incompetence. "
Not to mention subordinates
who shirk responsibility.
And because of our failure, the Führer has ordered
General Tanz to solve the problem of Warsaw.
How?
Meticulously.
In three phases.
Using the most
drastic means, I suppose.
Drastic?
Monstrous.
LIESOWSKI:
First roadblock, set up there.
Yes, sir.
The sniping last night came
from a street two blocks away.
The entire quarter
is to be sealed off.
We shall take a leaf
from the fisherman's book.
First, we'll mark out a wide perimeter, then
we'll start combing the outlying streets.
That should set the fish in motion.
Of course, they'll try to make off
in the opposite direction,
but we'll have roadblocks there
to cut them off.
By the time we've closed the net,
we'll have them exactly
where we want them.
With their backs to the ghetto wall.
Excuse me, general, what about
the civilian population?
The latest estimate, this section of the
city contains about 80,000 inhabitants.
One can hardly talk of a normal
civilian population in this place.
I regard the experience to
be gained from this operation
as absolutely indispensable.
Hold it at 20.
Now, about those
flamethrowers, sir,
to be on the safe side, I've requested
three times as many as needed.
What are you scared of,
children?
I think they're hungry.
What food do we have?
Some sandwiches, sir.
Bring them to me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, you're quite right,
they do look hungry.
Poor little devils.
Your lunch, sir.
Open.
Yes, sir.
Filth.
Your hands.
Look at those nails.
Not even Polish children
should be given such muck.
Make a note.
Food and sweets to be carried
at all times for the children.
It does no harm
to win their confidence.
As for him, he's relieved as my
orderly. Home leave cancelled.
Filthy pig. Last week
he offered me an unwashed glass.
Now he enters my sight looking as though he
just exhumed his grandmother with his bare hands.
Absolute cleanliness, that's what
I demand from the people around me.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
As for our immediate requirements,
see they're fully met.
Once they are,
I shall seal off the district
and put the inhabitants
through a sieve.
All 80,000?
General Tanz,
forgive me,
but just as a matter
of curiosity,
what do you feel is the exact
purpose of this exercise?
You've read the memorandum.
Oh, yes. Yes, I have...
And what does
the memorandum say?
That phase one is intended
to intimidate the population
to search houses,
to find and arrest resistance.
Then that is the exact purpose
of the exercise.
An excellent plan, by the way. Much
like my own when I first came here,
only I was never given the
ultimate authority to implement it.
But am I to understand that if there
is resistance during phase one,
you would then go to phase two
and even to phase three,
which would mean
the destruction of the entire city?
You are to understand
exactly that.
Well, uh, isn't that
somewhat excessive?
Excessive.
You will be aware that we are
We are moving ahead
on a 5000-mile front.
Every available soldier is needed
if we are to conquer Russia.
Yet here in Warsaw,
three divisions are rotting,
because of a few thousand criminal
Poles and Jews hiding in slums.
It is excessive to permit
this state of affairs.
Who is it?
You have my full list of requirements.
Eleanore, come in. Come in, my dear.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
My wife arrived early
this morning from Berlin.
How was Berlin?
Eager to hear the good news
that always follows in the wake
of a good soldier.
When I heard you were with my
husband, I came straight here.
I wanted to tell you myself what an
inspiration you've been to us all at home.
I am flattered, ma'am.
Oh, no, I'm not flattering you.
I'm honoring you
as you deserve.
If you're not too busy,
I shall need your help
with the arrangements
for the soiree tonight.
In your honor, General Tanz.
I'll look forward to it, ma'am.
Oh, incidentally, our daughter,
Ulrike, is here in Warsaw.
She'll be at the soiree too.
Yes?
Well, you remember her,
don't you?
In Berlin, at the garden party
at General Jodl's house.
Oh, yes, I do remember her.
My compliments, ma'am.
Sorry. I suppose
that was obvious.
But you know how mothers are.
Anxious to become
mothers-in-law, I should think.
A splendid officer,
no doubt of that.
A mother would be proud
to see her daughter...
Married to a war memorial?
Excuse me, ma'am.
I shall continue to study
General Tanz's plan.
With sinking heart.
I detest that man.
What does he mean,
"with sinking heart"?
Oh, the black book.
What were you saying, my dear?
I don't dare say anything
when you've got your book out.
One must protect
one's reputation.
Another mess like the one
you've made here in Warsaw
and you won't have
a reputation to protect.
What's the date?
The 13th.
Fortunately, I still have some
influence at Supreme Headquarters.
Indeed you have,
for which I am grateful.
How nice that you are here at last.
I want to talk to you about Ulrike.
And I want to talk to you
about the soiree tonight.
I think you should know that this
morning Ulrike was extremely rude to me.
Considering where you are
sending her, I'm not surprised.
Excuse me, general, but there
is a Major Grau from Intelligence.
He would like to see you.
What does he want?
He said it was personal.
He's most persistent.
Tell him, some other time.
Yes, sir.
By the way, what did you do
to your uniform last night?
Do? To my uniform?
Yes, there was a stain
on the jacket. A red stain.
But since you obviously
didn't cut yourself shaving,
it could only have been lipstick.
Shall I match the color with the
seductive shade Fräulein Neumaier wears?
Don't be absurd.
Anyway, the evidence is destroyed.
I've sent everything to be cleaned.
Aren't you glad that I am
here now to look after you?
Of course I am,
dear Eleanore.
We are well-suited, aren't we?
I wish you'd remember to knock.
Sorry, sir.
Major Grau of Intelligence just rang
from downstairs, sir. He asked to see you.
What about?
He wouldn't say, sir.
Tell him I'm busy.
I already told him, sir.
I took the liberty.
Good.
Well?
Apparently, he rang
the motor pool this morning.
Wanted to see the log for last night
to see if anyone had used the car.
I told the officer in charge that
no information could be released
without clearing it first with us.
Good. Yes, that's very good.
Thank you, sergeant.
Yes?
Sir, um, about my cousin Hartmann.
Your cousin Hartmann?
Yes, sir.
You have his record, sir.
On your desk, sir.
Oh, yes.
He's just out of hospital, sir.
He was wounded at Voronezh.
He's on temporary duty in Warsaw.
I had hoped that we could make
his duty with us permanent.
And by some extraordinary
coincidence,
he's waiting in your office
to see me.
Yes, sir.
Show him in.
Thank you, sir.
Come in.
Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal.
Reporting as ordered, sir.
At ease.
Well, it's a distinguished record,
corporal.
I see from your
press clippings,
Otto is obviously keeping
a scrapbook for you.
I see that you are
"the reincarnation of Siegfried,
a German hero
from the golden age. "
Do you feel like Siegfried?
Well, I'm not at all certain, sir,
how Siegfried felt.
Well, that's a sensible answer. I
see they've given you the Iron Cross.
He killed 40 Russians
single-handed, sir.
Splendid.
Well, now, as to your future,
I imagine that, as a university man,
you'd want to become an officer.
Therefore, I shall be happy
to send you to...
Erm...
You don't want to go
to officers school?
I should prefer to remain
a corporal, sir.
Actually, general,
he doesn't mean that.
What he means is...
What do you mean?
I mean, I don't want
to become an officer. That's all, sir.
I'm shattered.
My world is toppling.
What is the point of being a general
when corporals prefer to be corporals?
He's still a bit shaky,
after the hospital.
Yes, apparently.
Now, your cousin suggested
that you join us here at headquarters,
but I should think you'd be anxious
to get back to the fighting.
No?
No, sir.
General, what he really means is...
Leave us, sergeant.
I, um...
I don't seem
to understand you, corporal.
I want to survive, sir.
I want to live through the war.
Well, naturally. We all do.
But we are soldiers, we must fight.
Yes, sir. And I have.
And you don't want to go back.
Is this the " reincarnation
of Siegfried"?
I'm sorry, sir,
but I have a horror of death.
Even in a good cause?
Let me see now...
According to your papers,
in civilian life you were
a student at Dresden?
Music conservatory,
yes, sir. I studied piano.
Music, piano, yes. Yes.
Yes. I think I have
an assignment for you.
But one which requires great courage.
Only a man who has killed...
How many was it? Let me see.
Yes, 40 Russians single-handed,
would be equal to the task.
Now, what about Chopin,
wasn't he Polish?
Didn't he write the ?
Can you play them?
Yes, madam.
You don't sound
very enthusiastic.
Well, madam,
they were patriotic pieces,
celebrating the glory
of Poland.
Well, the glory of Poland isn't
precisely what we're here to celebrate.
No, madam. So I thought
that perhaps we might play...
Wagner.
I remember the Führer saying to me
after a performance of ,
"There's no such thing
as too much Wagner. "
After ?
I must say, it's unusual
to find a fighting man
who also knows about music.
Thank you, madam.
Oh, no, don't thank me,
wait until I've thanked you.
And I won't until
after the soiree.
I dislike being a bore, major.
You never bore me, Engel.
But I can't help wondering
what you're trying to prove.
Just what do you think you're doing?
My job.
But if you say anything to
any of them, he'll know...
The murderer will know
that you're after him.
That's the point of the exercise.
Good evening, sergeant.
Sir.
But look, sir, why do you care
who killed that bitch?
She's better off dead anyway.
Have you ever heard
of the Eumenides?
The what?
Greek mythology.
A number of disagreeable ladies,
sometimes known as the Furies.
They believe that spilled blood
calls out for vengeance.
That's how justice began.
Well, we don't want it to end,
do we, just because there's a war on?
Wait for me here.
I'm afraid I won't be long.
Mad.
MAN:
Grau.
Colonel Mannheim.
What on earth are you doing here?
You must be out of your mind.
If the generals won't see me,
I must come here to see them.
Well, God help you, Grau.
I won't.
Better have some champagne.
You'll need it.
You may be right, sir.
General Tanz, to my mind
you're a model man in every respect.
Except one.
You've not married.
May I ask why not?
No opportunity. Greatly regret it.
Well, perhaps you've allowed
opportunities to slip by.
My dear, General Tanz is a young man
whose life has been spent as a soldier.
His generation has been denied
the pleasures of domesticity.
We live in a period which makes
great demands upon us.
Consequently, there is little time for
what is commonly known as private life.
Quite right. Champagne, general?
Water.
Water?
A glass of water for General Tanz.
Ah. Here comes Ulrike.
You remember her from Berlin.
Good evening, general.
She's been with me over
a year now, as a soldier.
An excellent soldier.
Thank you, Father.
I must say, I still find it hard to get
used to the idea of young girls in the army.
We're building a new world order, and women
should not be exempt from playing their part.
I knew you would understand,
general.
Ulrike has now decided
to become a nurse
in a military hospital run
by an order of nuns in Bavaria.
We're very proud of our girl.
Tell me, general, is it true
that in the battle of Leningrad
you used frozen bodies instead
of sandbags for your artillery?
The story is exaggerated.
Oh, I am sorry.
Some soldiers lie and rot
in the battlefield.
I thought it most imaginative, putting
the dead to work, you might say.
Nobody rots with me.
Your water, general.
Thank you.
My compliments. I liked the bit
about the frozen bodies.
Oh, thank you, general.
Be careful.
Ulrike has a most original
way of expressing herself.
Needless to say, I shall
miss not having her with me.
Then why let her go?
Come along, general,
let's have some supper.
You'll join us, too,
Kahlenberge?
Courage.
Is not enough.
How dare you speak like that
to General Tanz?
It serves you right, Mother,
for what you're doing to me.
Whatever I do is for your own good.
I think only of you.
Only of me?
You have changed.
When did I begin
to interest you so much?
Good evening.
You've become vicious.
Yes, it's the war, Mother.
Well, the nuns will soon
improve your manners.
Suppose I refuse to go?
You will be ordered to go. I have seen
to that already. You have no choice.
You really are a terrible
woman, Mother.
I suppose we deserve
each other.
Colonel Mannheim!
Good evening.
Yes, I'd love to dance with you.
In my memoirs,
I keep a record of everything.
Yours will be the place of honor
in the Warsaw chapter.
GRAU:
General von Seidlitz-Gabler?
Sir.
Oh, yes, you are Major...?
Grau, Intelligence.
Under Colonel Mannheim.
I tried to see you today.
In fact, I tried to see each of you,
without much success, I'm afraid.
I'm sorry, major, but general
officers are sometimes busy, you know?
Of course.
What was it you wanted
to see us about?
Last night,
a prostitute was murdered.
A prostitute? That's an
occupational hazard, isn't it?
When you hear the details, I'm sure
you'll agree it's a unique case.
Unique?
You can't be serious.
We live in an age in which bodies lie
around streets like cobblestones.
What's so unique
about this case?
All right, all right,
come to the point, major.
Last night, a woman
was murdered.
Yes, general, in Bulkowa Street,
number 27, fourth-floor apartment,
Maria Kupiecka, a prostitute,
also one of our agents.
She was stabbed to death most
brutally. Cut to pieces, in fact.
A charming story.
But what has that to do with us?
Preliminary investigation has
established that each of you was...
well, unaccounted
for last night.
To whom should we be
accountable, major?
I fail to see what my...
What our movements should have to do
with you or with this woman's death.
Well, the murderer was seen
leaving the woman's room.
In that case,
you must know who he is.
Not exactly. The face was not
visible, but the uniform was.
It was the uniform
of a German officer.
In fact, a German general.
This is a serious charge.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Oh, yes, sir, my duty.
Then consider your duty
done, major. Good night.
Are you, by any chance,
using perfume?
I occasionally use a strong
eau de cologne after shaving.
Good night, sir.
I will, of course, want to see each of
you tomorrow, if I may, in line of duty.
It is quite possible
we've been misled,
but we don't want to leave
any loose ends dangling, do we?
Until tomorrow.
Good night, generals.
Astonishing behavior!
Who invited him?
Not I.
Socially, Major Grau
has not been a success.
I'm sorry, general.
I should have had him arrested.
Why? He was merely
doing his duty.
Yes.
Well...
Now, there are some officers
I should like to present to you.
Some sauerbraten, general?
Make yourself comfortable,
inspector.
This is my third restaurant
in Berlin.
That's if you count the sausage shop I had
down by the station right after the war.
We were really on our arse then.
Now look, Germany is booming.
We made it.
Well, come along, inspector,
do sit down.
One large Munchen, please.
Now, then, you asked me
about General Kahlenberge.
Well, I don't suppose there was
anyone who knew him better than me.
Hartmann's doing
a good job, isn't he, sir?
Yes. What?
Oh, yes! Apparently.
OTTO:
got together
almost from
the
damned Allies would drop
Nice.
I'd forgotten how nice.
Would you say there
were no girls in Russia?
Girls? I was too scared.
I'm hopeless when I'm scared.
Well, it's a good thing
I don't scare you, isn't it?
Yes, it's just that this room
makes me nervous.
Nervous?
Mm.
Oh, you have no sense of history.
Do you realize this used to be
the bed of the king of Poland.
Did it really?
Mm-hm.
It's like sleeping on the floor.
It's freezing in here.
Ah, but the king and the queen
never slept. They just made love.
They were never cold.
Do you like the war?
Do I like the war?
Good God, no. Do you?
If it weren't for the war, I'd be on the
marriage circuit now, living on some army post,
making conversation
with dreary young officers.
Instead of making love
with dreary young corporals.
Oh, not dreary. Not at all.
In fact, the best so far.
Oh?
Do you specialize in corporals?
No.
Only heroes like you.
Just think, all this bravery
in my arms.
It must be very inspiring.
What's the matter?
You know, we mustn't like
each other too much.
Why? Because I'm a corporal
and you're a general's daughter?
No. It's because...
It's a man, a girl, a war.
Two boys I knew
are already dead in Russia.
It's funny.
In the dark,
you feel just like them to me.
And you like this war?
No. I like this.
No, no!
What's wrong?
Nothing. I thought
they were firing at me.
You're shaking like a leaf.
I'm all right now.
What's it like having people
try to kill you?
Noisy bastards.
Good morning.
Good morning,
king of Poland.
What's it like having people
try to kill you?
Well, what do you think it's like?
Terrible.
Yes.
I'm glad...
Well, I'm glad that you're here.
So am I.
But you'll be going back soon,
I suppose?
Not if I can help it, I won't.
Can you bear the truth?
Probably not.
I'm a fraud.
Impossible.
When they opened fire on us
at Voronezh, I ran away.
It's as simple as that.
Then, I've no idea how, I was hit.
It was like a door slamming in
my head, and I thought I was dead.
Next thing I remember
waking up in the hospital
and there was this general
congratulating me
on having killed 40 Russians
single-handed.
You see, they were all killed
that day, the whole company.
Everyone was killed except me,
and I suppose
it didn't look too good in dispatches,
a whole company being wiped out,
so they decided
to make a hero of the survivor.
The one who ran away.
So now what do you think
of all that bravery?
Well, that's a lovely story.
I think it's marvelous.
Marvelous?
Yes.
For once, the joke's on them.
Come, make love
to the queen of Poland.
I must say you are,
well, unexpected.
It's lucky we met.
What's lucky is right now.
You know, when this war is over...
Mm-mm. It will never end.
Well, what happened?
Did you see them?
Generals Gabler and Kahlenberge are
in conference and cannot be disturbed.
I told you they wouldn't see you.
Where's General Tanz?
Look, why don't
we forget about this?
It's not as if we don't have
other things to do.
Where's General Tanz?
In the old city, conducting
a tactical exercise.
I don't trust him.
Naturally, in the field,
he must use his discretion.
He has no discretion.
He is ruthless.
Now, now, you exaggerate.
He will only go to phase two if phase
one should prove to be a failure.
What is a failure?
Well, if the Poles, the Jews
try to retaliate.
What constitutes retaliation,
a rock thrown at his golden head?
Is that sufficient warrant
for the demolition of the city?
You always overstate things,
Kahlenberge.
General Tanz
is a responsible officer...
Come in.
Sorry, sir. Colonel Mannheim
to see General Kahlenberge, sir.
We'll discuss this later.
And don't worry about Tanz.
I'll take care of him.
Colonel Mannheim, sir.
You wanted to see me, general.
Yes, yes.
Yes, I did, colonel.
I wanted to see you about...
Damn it, what was it about?
Yes.
Yes, I remember now.
You have an officer on
your staff, a Major Grau.
Halt! Halt!
Major Grau to see General Tanz.
Major Grau?
Just a minute, sir.
Get me CP,
Colonel Sandauer, urgent.
Roadblock 4 calling CP.
Roadblock 4 calling CP.
Can you hear me? Over.
Get your hands up.
Hands up.
SOLDIER 1: Colonel Sandauer
on the line, sergeant.
Colonel Sandauer,
there's a Major Grau here.
Wants to see the general.
My orders were...
What? Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
You may pass, major.
Stop!
Go ahead.
Well, at least you have one friend.
So it would seem.
Hands up!
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Have them over here.
Over here. Over here.
Get back!
Name?
First name?
Profession?
Halt!
Major Grau.
Go ahead, sir.
Wait for me here.
This is Wehrmacht's radio unit
assigned to the Reich's general
government of Poland.
This broadcast is coming to you
directly from Warsaw.
A few yards from where I am, I see
General Tanz, the hero of Leningrad.
He is conducting maneuvers
in the streets of the city.
An entire area is being temporarily evacuated
in the interest of public order and safety.
Sector one reports
phase one successful.
Sector three,
no resistance encountered.
Thank you, Sandauer.
ANNOUNCER: The soldiers, of course,
are dedicated to their commander.
He is a superb craftsman of war
and his presence alone inspires
men to extraordinary valor.
The exercise is being carried out with
meticulous precision according to plan.
The population is extremely
cooperative and friendly.
SANDAUER: Sector four
reports phase one operative.
Sector two,
flamethrowers ready to action.
Phase one to continue
until further orders.
Yes, sir.
All sectors, from commanding general,
phase one to continue until further orders.
Main sector, flamethrowers ready, sir.
Go ahead.
Forward march.
General Tanz?
A few more minutes.
SOLDIER 2: Halt!
SOLDIER 3: Stop!
Get him!
Stop! Fire!
Sandauer!
SANDAUER: Sir?
Stand by for phase two.
Phase two, sir?
Stand by for phase two.
Yes, sir.
Notify all units.
Phase one completed.
Stand by for phase two.
Yes, sir.
CP to all sectors,
stand by for phase two.
Phase two!
Phase two.
Yes, sir. Phase two.
Phase two.
Fire!
Fire!
Now the major
may put his questions.
He's gone, sir.
That maniac is blowing up
half the city.
Let's go.
Did you say there was
no real resistance?
No, I was there.
One shot from one sniper, that
was all, and he blows up the city!
Now, now,
we're not the generals.
It is their business,
you know, not ours.
We're here just
to keep the papers moving.
And yours have arrived.
Congratulations.
For what?
You've been promoted
to lieutenant colonel.
Promoted?
And transferred to Paris
as of this date.
Lucky fellow.
Transferred, but why?
Who signed the transfer?
General Gabler, naturally.
What are you doing?
I'm going to find out
where the order originated.
On whose recommendation here.
Calm down. I've already checked.
General Kahlenberge.
He recommended your transfer.
Did he indeed?
You must have made
quite an impression last night.
It would seem so.
Thank you, colonel.
It's just as well, you know.
That's a matter of opinion.
Above all, Major Grau,
not too much zeal.
I have a zealous nature,
sir. I can't help it.
Yes, inspector, I was
in Warsaw with General Tanz.
And I resent those
cheap journalists
who try to make him out to be some
sort of inhuman monster. He was not.
Forgive me, inspector. We hire
a lot of foreigners nowadays.
We can't get Germans
any more, not for real work.
I've seen General Tanz in the field,
with the wounded, the dying.
He was extraordinary.
Compassionate, gentle.
Do you know that after Leningrad,
Hitler ordered the general
not to expose himself to enemy fire.
Of course, he found this a great
hardship. He was only happy in battle.
Yes?
Ah, .
I'm also learning Spanish.
Well, soon everything
will be automated.
Except the manager, of course.
And then in July 1944,
we were transferred to Paris.
The Allies were
in Normandy by then
and Hitler ordered us to stop them
in front of Paris.
We nearly did too, except that
the army was betrayed, as usual.
But we mustn't talk politics.
It's bad for business, isn't it?
You asked me about Paris.
Thank you, that will be all.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Oh, I shall be with General Gabler
in the War Room.
What about my pass?
Is it all right?
For God's sake, relax!
Operation Hartmann, phase one,
will begin tomorrow, 18 July, at 0915
when the lance corporal
reports to the railway station.
With a car.
With a car duly requisitioned
from the motor pool.
Phase two, the lance corporal will then
meet the secret consignment from Berlin.
Then?
Then phase three.
A 24-hour pass for the lance corporal
will begin tomorrow at noon.
You've got it?
Here.
A corporal and
a general's daughter.
You know, you really are
asking for trouble.
But it's your funeral, not mine!
OFFICER: The British second army
has been advancing towards the left,
trying to cut off two of our panzer
divisions from our main supply route.
During the last 48 hours,
the enemy has succeeded
in crossing the Ohm River,
here and here.
However, we were able
to stop them here,
with help from the
which is counterattacking
at the moment.
Well?
Now what do we do?
To be precise, what do you do?
We. You're in this too.
General Gabler.
The field marshal will see you at 4:00.
Thank you, major.
I admit that
it's inconvenient for you.
It's a good deal more
than that. Why?
Just why is General Tanz arriving
three days earlier than was planned?
You suspect something odd?
He comes straight from Hitler.
Isn't that odd enough?
I want to hear this.
The American 1st Army
occupied the town of Saint-Claude.
Our troops are withdrawing to
new positions south and southeast.
GRAU: General Gabler,
General Kahlenberge.
I never had the opportunity
to thank you for my promotion.
I'm sorry. Grau,
Intelligence, Warsaw 1942.
Oh, yes, yes.
Good to see you again, colonel.
You once had the vision
to transfer me to Paris.
We do our best to give pleasure,
colonel. Good day.
I understand we're soon
to be joined by General Tanz.
Quite like old times.
Excuse me.
I just wanted to greet you.
General.
Tiresome fellow.
Strange, isn't it?
Everybody seems to be aware
that Tanz is coming here.
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.
Obviously not.
It's always disagreeable
when the cat gets back
to find the mice
have been playing.
We could, of course,
distract the cat
by suggesting that he take
a few days off to play a little too.
Particularly after all...
After all that you've been through, my dear
general, these past few months in Russia,
I know it must have been
perfect hell for you.
I want 4,000 men
by the end of the week.
And you shall have them.
Your Colonel Sandauer has been working
closely with General Kahlenberge.
We are scraping the sides of
the barrel, but you'll have 4,000.
Meanwhile, why don't you
take a few days off?
Rest a bit, see the sights
of Paris. It's your first visit.
I want only combat troops,
no decaying old men or children.
Yes, sir. We are making good
progress, General Kahlenberge and I.
After all, it may be your
last chance to see Paris.
It may be anyone's
last chance. Such a pity.
A necessity.
But of course.
Of course it's necessary.
Stern measures, the only thing
people respect.
All I'm suggesting is that
you leave everything to us.
A commander does not...
And your excellent Colonel Sandauer.
We've arranged a suite
for you at the... Kahlenberge?
At your hotel.
At the Excelsior.
You'll have a car, a driver and
whatever else strikes your fancy.
One must relax occasionally, general.
I can't afford to.
You give me no alternative
but to compel you to enjoy yourself.
Must I order you?
Because if I must,
I'm afraid I shall have to.
Yes, sir.
Evidently, you are not
ready for me.
Very well.
I shall devote one day
to seeing the city.
I shall return to headquarters at
Heil, Hitler.
GABLER:
Heil Hitler.
Well, that wasn't so bad.
You now have one day's grace.
We need two, until the 20th.
Come and have dinner with
me and Eleanore tomorrow.
Ulrike's arriving.
This is bad luck.
Naturally, she forgot to say
which train she'd be on.
I assume you are with us now.
In spirit, of course, but...
You'll have to make up
your mind. Soon.
Making up one's mind is one
thing, speaking it is another.
You worry too much.
Patience is one of
the few virtues that I possess.
At ease.
Sergeant, get me the military
governor's office on the telephone.
Corporal?
Sir.
I have an assignment for you.
Come in.
Get me the military
governor's office.
For General Kahlenberge.
You're to stay with him
every minute of the day.
Yes, sir.
He may want to go out at night.
Do you know anything which
might interest General Tanz?
Nightclubs or girls,
that sort of thing.
A few, sir.
But I don't really know
what the general's taste is, sir.
Let us hope that whatever it is,
it is not you, corporal.
However, if it should be, remember
that you're serving the fatherland.
I'll try to remember, sir.
Should he ask you to take him to his
headquarters, you are to telephone me.
Either here or at my hotel.
Yes, sir.
You'll report to Colonel Sandauer
for specific instructions.
Sir?
What is it, corporal?
I'm sorry, but I was supposed to have
a 24-hour leave starting tomorrow.
That's impossible.
Could I have one hour free
in the morning, sir?
No.
Sir.
Hartmann?
Sir?
This is important.
All right.
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes. Childhood diseases?
Measles.
I can't remember.
Nothing serious, I think.
Chickenpox.
Bed-wetting?
No, sir.
Fear of the dark?
No, not particularly.
Venereal disease?
No, sir.
Good.
Now, what about books?
Books?
Do you read books?
Yes, sir, I read books.
What?
Nietzsche,
.
Books on psychology,
pathology?
No, not much.
Show me your hands.
All right. Now, you'll have a room
assigned to you in the general's hotel.
He'll want to see
the principal sights of Paris.
You will prepare an itinerary
and submit it to me.
When not in the field,
the general goes to bed at 11:45.
He seldom drinks or smokes,
so you will probably have
an early evening.
Now, this is my private number,
in case you should need me.
Need you, sir?
If anything out of the ordinary
should happen, ring me immediately.
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Incidentally, avoid all cemeteries,
tombs, any mention of death.
Yes, sir.
Sir?
Inspector Morand, please.
Third floor, room 158.
Who shall I say is here?
Thank you. I can find my own way.
Welcome, Colonel Grau,
to the spider's web.
How did you know it was me?
What other German colonel
would enter unannounced?
Almost any SS colonel would.
Actually, I saw you reflected
in the window.
Impossible, it's too dirty.
I hope you're not allergic to dust.
Old crimes, colonel.
They generate
a good deal of dust.
Unsolved crimes.
The dust has settled.
We can always unsettle it.
Is that why you came?
Do sit down, colonel.
I must apologize for the heat,
but it's nearly August,
when most Parisians
leave Paris.
Let's hope Germans have
the good sense to do the same.
Saint-Lô fell to the Allies
this morning.
BBC?
Coffee?
No, thank you.
You have dossiers
on everyone, don't you?
On everyone interesting.
German as well as French?
At the specific request
of German Intelligence,
we keep an occasional eye
on interesting Germans.
Like me?
I have always found you interesting.
Thank you.
What about German generals?
Well, what about them?
Generals are interesting?
Then, to the degree that they are
interesting, we keep an eye on them too.
Good. Here are the names of three generals.
I want to know everything about them.
Everything may be too much.
What specifically
are you looking for?
One of them is a murderer.
Only one?
But murder is the occupation
of generals.
Let's say what is admirable on the
large scale is monstrous on the small.
Since we must give medals
to mass murderers,
let us try to give justice
to the small entrepreneur.
Nicely put. I shall be glad
to help you if I can.
I realize that nothing is free in
this world, even between colleagues.
Especially between colleagues.
In exchange
for your information,
I shall arrange for the release from
prison of three French resistance.
Thank you.
Have you a favorite suspect?
Not really, no.
You see, on the night
of the murder,
each general
had something to conceal.
The night of the murder was...?
December the 12th,
And just as I started my investigation,
I was transferred to Paris.
By the murderer?
Possibly.
For two years, I've wanted
to reopen the case.
Now I can. As of today,
all three are in Paris.
General Gabler.
He's partial to the sort
of girl who was killed.
Oh, a girl. A crime
of passion, as we say.
Passion, yes, but only in the sense
of your distinguished Marquis de Sade.
Oh, a sex crime, I see.
Is that why this case excites you?
The girl was also
a German agent.
She may have been killed
because of something she knew.
That's why Kahlenberge
intrigues me the most.
He seems to have no private life
and yet he disappears
from time to time.
No one knows where or why.
And General Tanz?
A perfect maniac.
an entire quarter of
Warsaw
Hartmann?
Yes.
I'm Sergeant Kopatski,
the general's orderly.
For the time being, that is.
I forgot to take his laces out before
cleaning his shoes this morning.
For God's sake,
where are your gloves?
You'll get finger marks on it.
I haven't got gloves.
They never told me.
Take mine.
These are the general's
holiday rations.
One bottle of cognac, one Thermos
of coffee at 40 degrees centigrade,
two hundred cigarettes.
Does the general drink?
Like a sponge,
only he never shows it.
Put the briefcase
on the back seat.
On the right side.
Whenever he leaves the car,
clean out the ashtrays.
He smokes like a chimney.
Clean everything in sight.
Clean everything out of sight,
including the engine.
If you don't, he'll tear
your head off.
It's now one second to 9:00.
Here he comes.
I've given him full
instructions, sir.
Name?
Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal, sir.
Show the general your hands.
Well, don't stand there like a fool.
Put your gloves on.
He seems to know Paris.
He's prepared an itinerary of the
sights of the city. I have endorsed it.
I shall see you tomorrow morning
at headquarters.
Yes, general.
Sergeant Kopatski
is relieved as my orderly.
This morning he smeared
polish on my shoelaces.
Fourteen days confined to barracks.
Yes, general.
We've just passed
the Place Vendôme, sir.
The column is 142 feet high
and was erected in 1810.
It's made of bronze from 1200 cannon
captured at Austerlitz.
There's a statue of Napoleon
on the top.
In front of us, sir,
the Tuileries Gardens.
The Tuileries Palace used to be
in the middle of the gardens.
In 1792, at the time
of the French Revolution,
the Paris mob attacked
the palace,
forcing the king and queen
to escape.
It was burnt down in...
in 1871.
We are now coming
into Place de la Concorde.
One of the most beautiful squares
in Paris.
It was here, in the middle
of the square
that Louis XVI
and Marie Antoinette
were beheaded
during the revolution.
The guillotine was there, in the
centre, where the obelisk is now.
Keep your eye
on the road, corporal.
Yes, sir.
Fräulein Gabler?
Yes.
I'm Sergeant Kopke
from your father's headquarters.
How did they know
which train I was on?
They didn't.
May I?
You see, I'm Hartmann's cousin.
We got no secrets, Hartmann and me.
More like brothers, really.
He's all right, isn't he?
All right? Never better.
No, it's just at the last moment he
was assigned to drive General Tanz.
Only for today. That's
why he couldn't meet you.
Well, how are things
in the fatherland?
Any cities left
after all the bombing?
A few, yes, here and there.
There's one good thing about Paris.
It's an open city, no bombs.
I hate bombs.
This way, Fräulein Gabler.
I have a car for you just outside.
I'll take you
to your father's hotel.
Hartmann's staying there too.
With General Tanz,
just for tonight.
So I suppose you'll run
into him sooner or later,
in the lobby or something.
The gallery is shut
to the public, sir.
But special permission has been
granted for you to see the paintings.
Most of them have been
confiscated and assembled here
before being sent to Germany.
General Tanz.
You've been notified.
Yes, corporal.
Here's all the information.
On your right, sir,
paintings by Boucher,
the 18th-century
French master.
All these paintings
have been selected
for  Goering.
What's in there?
Paintings requisitioned from private
collections by the
What kind of paintings?
Modern, sir,
and some impressionists.
Decadent?
I suppose so, sir.
HARTMANN:
Light.
Toulouse-Lautrec, .
Renoir,  painted in 1910.
Gauguin, ,
from his Tahitian period.
Another  by Renoir.
Soutine, .
Degas, , painted in 1886.
Van Gogh, Vincent,
Sometimes called
painted while in an insane asylum
during the last years of his life.
Here, sir, a painting by Cézanne.
How dare you touch me?
Excuse me, sir, but...
Never do that again!
