We are calling to varify
a soldier killer in action.
Yes, you will be contacted right away.
Who was in charge of
No. 238 Jin Seok Lee?
Jin Seok Lee? It was me.
Why? I checked the hole and
pictures of the scene.
Killed In Action...
He's not listed in the
Missing In Action list either.
Did you try the
Army Recruitment list?
Jin Seok Lee...
Army Recruitment List...
Alive?
Grandpa, grandpa.
You have a call.
It's from the Army.
Hello?
Hello, sir. I'm from the
Korea War Excavation Team.
We wanted to varify a person
we found while excavating.
Yes...
Are you Jin Seok Lee
from the 12th infantry
who participated in the
battle of Doom Il Yung?
Yes, yes I am.
We found a remain with the
same name of Jin Seok Lee.
Oh, really?
I'm Jin Seok Lee.
Isn't it Jin Tae Lee
that you found?
No. We're positive it's
Jin Seok Lee.
We just wanted to double check.
We apologize for the inconviniece.
It seems that the name was
ommited from our list
or may have just made an
error in our part.
What did they say?
Wasn't it about your brother?
I thought because they said that
they were from the military
that they found your brother.
Grandpa, should I help
with the garden?
I need you to drive
somewhere with me.
I tried to stop him but
he wouldn't listen.
Of course, I'm driving.
Don't worry, mom.
Mom's very worried.
The is a rough mountain road
and your leg isn't well.
I'll call her later.
You went to look for your
brother last year in Yong Byong
and you were very exhausted.
Yes, you're right.
You go on and pull out the car.
O.K.
Do you have your ID with you?
They'll probably check you
when we get there.
Yes, drivers license, student ID,
citizen ID, I have everything
so don't worry.
Ok, Ok.
Grandpa, you're not
wearing sneakers, are you?
I'll shine your shoes for you.
Shoe shine!
Shoe shine!
Shoe shine!
Shoe shine!
Shoe shine...
Shoe shine...
Shoe shine.
Shoe shine.
Shoe shine!
That middle one there
is made with Italian leather
that just came in.
Looks nice.
It's really nicely made.
Heels are high and
nicely sewed.
But I like low heels better.
It looks more comfortable.
Really?
But you'll make much
better shoes than that.
I still have a long way to go.
In a few years, imagining you
making shoes in a shop like this
makes me feel so proud of you.
You shouldn't have.
It's too expensive.
You always wanted one, right?
Looks great!
Thanks...
Hey! Ice cream!
Give me one big one.
There are two of you, why not 2?
Just give me one.
O.K. Let's see, nicely frozen...
Here.
You don't have to...
Go on.
What about you?
My teeth will hurt so
I don't want it.
How much?
Thank you.
Sell a lot.
- You take the first bite.
- I'm OK.
- Have a bite.
- I said you eat it.
Here, bite it.
The trolly!
Shoe shine!
Jin Seok, where are you going?
I have to go home.
I did all my studies.
I'll teach them to you tomorrow.
You have to teach me tomorrow. OK?
Mom.
What are you still doing?
Can't you see?
We still have customers.
How are you, Jin Seok?
Hi.
Hold on!
I'll put some in a bowl.
It's alright.
I told you not to wipe on your shirt.
Come here.
Hey, I'm alright.
- I said come here.
- I said I'm alright!
Thank you.
Good bye.
Where did you get this wheat?
Oh, that?
They said if I joined some
group I'll get some.
Really?
What group gives 2 sacks of wheat
just for signing up?
If I knew it sooner
I could have taken mother, too.
There are no free lunches.
Don't worry so much.
Let's hurry. Dad must be hungry.
Hey, stop it!
Dad, Jin Seok got 1st in his
exam again at school.
Isn't he great?
Jin Seok will do all the things
you wanted to do.
Please help him get into
Seoul Univerisity next year...
and watch over his health.
Last spring was terrible.
It wasn't that bad, dad.
I'm fine now.
Mom says come in
and pay your respects.
Dad, you know Young Shin, right?
Young Shin and Jin Tae
will marry in the fall.
Mom's already worried
and feels sorry that
her daughter-in-law
may have hard times.
I'm sure you would have liked
her if you were here.
Mom, kids must be hungry.
Jin Seok, let's clean up.
Go and help mom.
OK.
Open the top.
Alright.
There you go again.
Use this from now on.
I made it from an old dress.
And don't lose it.
Young Min, what was
most tasty today?
I liked meat.
I liked cookies.
I liked dried persimon.
After we finish dinner,
let's go to the stream.
It's too late to go.
We have to go home and sleep soon.
It's Sunday tomorrow and no school.
And it's too hot to sleep.
- Come on... let's go.
- Where?
You look so happy.
I wish everyday was like today.
Yes, I know Jin Tae is like
this on the outside,
but I know that he's
very kind deep inside.
It's ok, mom, let's go.
No, I don't want to!
Why are you cutting it off?
I think high heels are much cooler.
Wow, it really looks like
a shoe from the store.
Are you going to sell it?
Why? If I sell it,
will you buy it?
If the price is right, why not?
You think that just anyone
can wear these fancy shoes?
Your toes will laugh at you.
Can you tell me why this
word is spelled this way?
I told you not to ask me
these kinds of questions!
You don't even know this?
It's a second grader question.
Just go and shine shoes.
Forget it!
Oh, hi Jin Seok.
You're going to tutor me, right?
Jin Seok, you're still here?
Didn't you hear the news?
War broke out.
This early morning, North Koreans
passed the 38th parallel and attacked...
What is all this?
Are you moving?
Can't you see?
These are the things we need.
I said just take food and clothes.
I won't ask you to carry them
so don't worry.
You think uncle's house is
just around the corner?
Put them back.
Leave them alone!
I'm taking them.
How are you going to take them all?
I'm going to take them!
I'll take every single one of them!
Don't be stupid!
I'm taking them!
I said I'm taking them!
I said we'll come back soon.
You think all will turn out
the way you think?
We don't even know when
we'll be able to come back.
Noodle business was just
about to get better...
We're going to lose our
business spot too.
What about all the
kimchee and the soy sauce?
And what about the
potatoes we just planted?
They'll all still be here
so don't worry.
What if you get drafted to the military?
What are they going to do
with someone like me?
We'd better hurry.
Most have left already and
the refugees are packed everywhere.
Hurry, Young Ja.
Let's go.
Mother.
She said not to get separated
so watch the kids well.
Put Young Min up here.
Young Min, get up there.
Hold on tight.
Wait here for us. We'll be back.
Jin Seok, let's go.
Jin Seok.
Hold hands tight!
Young-ja!
What the hell is that train
sitting over there for?
I told you
trains for civilians are not running!
Where's a pharmacy?
I don't know
Let's go to the war front
And destroy the communists!
We must protect our country!
I think we have to
give up the train
- What about that one?
- It's leaving for the front
- Is Jin-tae back?
- Not yet
Jin-tae will bring you
some medicine in a minute
Salute!
Excuse us, but we're
on official business
Men between 18 and 30

Between 18 and 30!
It's nothing serious
Just step forward

Everything will be fine
I'm still a student

You aren't allowed to go

We'll win!

Brave volunteer student soldiers

Where are you going?
I'm looking for my brother
You're not permitted in here
You'll have to leave
- Jin-seok! Jin-seok!
- Stop right there!
Jin-tae!
Let's go!
This isn't the train to uncle's house
We're leaving soon
Sit down
My brother got on the wrong train
We're getting off
I said sit down
You must be mistaken
We're refugees
not soldiers
You've just been drafted, too
Then who's gonna look
after my mother? You?
Sit down!
That is an order
You order your soldiers
We are leaving
I told you to sit down!
You must be mistaken
Why can't you understand
Jin-seok
get off now!
Jin-seok
go, now!
Stay still!
Jin-tae!
Jin-tae!
Jin-tae!
My brother has a problem
with his heart
He can't even run
Tell that at the
training camp
Only those without arms or legs
or who can't talk or hear
At war, they're
called patients
Jin-seok, Jin-tae!
Jin-tae!
What are you doing, you bastard!
Mom!
- Mom!
- Mom
Jin-seok, Jin-tae!
Mom, Young-shin!

I'll take care of Jin-seok
Don't worry!
- What happened to your face?
- Take care of mom
Don't worry about us
You take care of yourselves
You must come home!
You must come home!
Jin-tae...
Mom!

Jin-tae! Jin-seok!
Mom!

- KANG Yong-jin!
- Yes sir!
- KIM Ki-tae
- Yes, sir!
- LEE Jin-seok!
- Yes, sir!
Excuse me, sir
- May I have a word with you sir?
- Go ahead
This is my younger brother
Please let us stay close
He's just a student and
knows nothing about war
I'll teach him
Please
Alright
Here, Nakdong River
is our last line of defense
If this place is taken
the next is Busan, and then...
we've got nowhere to go
but into the sea
If you retreat
I'll kill you myself
This is where we
live or die
Write your wills and
whatever you wanna leave
put it in here, Got it?
- Attention, salute!
- Sir!
Damn young punk
What does he know about
death and wills?
Okay, let's say hello
- I am GO Yong-man
- I am LEE Jin-tae
Let me ask you something
Are you two related?
- He's my older brother
- You're brothers? Damn!
I thought they were only supposed
to take one per family!
Who's going to carry on
the family name?
Is the country going to?
Those bastards
Forget the will!
Forget it!
You never know when
the next meal will come
Eat this shit
Just call me Uncle Yang
He's the eldest
in our platoon
He's a self-proclaimed fortuneteller
but he's never right
Welcome
Don't ever take your helmet off
Many get their heads
blown off while sleeping
I'm Sergeant LEEM
I hate anything red
especially the reds!
I am Tae-soo, I escaped
from North Korea
But don't mistake me as a commie
I'm Seung-chul
I was a student but
I volunteered to fight
Say 'Hello', PFC Jo
Whatever for, We'll all be
dead soon anyway
- I'm PFC Jo
- I am Yong-goo
Just call me radio man
I am KIM Cheol-soo
I go by Ban
They are asking me
to fight, eating this?
No water or soup at all?
And mine's so damn small!
You don't want it?
Give it to me
Eat it
Jin-seok!
Jin-seok, are you okay?
Jin-seok, you okay?
Stay right there
Stay put
Jin-tae
I told you to
stay there!
Jin-seok, Jin-seok!
Hang on, Jin-seok!
Please keep breathing!
Jin-seok, You can do it
Jin-seok, breathe in!
Now breathe out
More, more!
Spit it out!
Now breathe in!
Jin-seok, You can do it
Deeper, deeper, Jin-seok!
You're okay!
Okay, okay
You're fine
Please send my brother
to the hospital
I'll blow up their tanks or
bring you their commanders
I'll even carry a bomb
- into their camp
- There is one with an epileptic
Another has pulmonary tuberculosis
One in 3rd platoon has rheumatism
Another with heart disease
And one with pulmonary tuberculosis
Need more?
Should I send them all?
Who'll fight then?
Life and death crosses
here every second
If you do
what you've said
and I can even send
your brother home!
I'll do whatever I can do
if I can send him home
That's the spirit we need
You have to give to
your country
before asking for something
Just for your information
it's been done before
There, a father and son
were in the same unit
who could send his son home
Wanna know how?
Wills are for dying people
You've got to be strong
I wish all this
would just be a dream
I want to wake up in my room
I'd tell you about this
over breakfast
I would tell you that
I had a strange dream
Then I would go to school
and you and mom would go to work
Don't worry
We will be just fine
Urgent call from
the battalion bunker, sir!
What is it?
The 2nd and 3rd have
lost their positions
Damn it!
- Wake them up!
- Yes, sir!
Everybody, wake up!
Everybody up! Up!
Area 721 and
area 734 have
fallen into the enemy's hands
Additionally, our supply route
has been cut off
This means
we're isolated
Remove all the rocks
They're shrapnel
waiting to happen
Area 731 and 732 are gone
We're next!
The bastards are gonna
hit us hard, like dogs
There won't be anyone
left to bury us
Let the commies come!
I'll kill everyone I can!
Attention!
Sergeant HUH, KOH Yong-man
LIM Tae-soo, KANG Hyo-Yul
YANG, JANG, LEE Seung-chul
Get armed and come with me
What's going on?
There's an order to plant mines
on the defense line
Shit, that's right
under their noses
So what?
I have to go there?
I'm going, too
Yong-man is out
Jin-tae is going, instead
Rest of you get back to
what you were doing
Yes, sir!
- Damn, I always get the shit
- Jin-tae!
- Jin-tae!
- Hurry up!
Those commies will
take over anytime
They slaughter the families
of soldiers and cops
That's why we've got to
win this war!
If we lose, the commies
will kill us all!
Win to live
Win how?
Eating mud?
Get back to work!
Aimed fire!
Hide yourselves quick!
- Get down!
- Seung-chul! Don't move!
Be careful of the land mine
Seung-chul!
Yang and I will
go get him!
Cover us!
Seung-chul, hang on
hang on there!
I'll be there soon
so don't move!
Crazy bastards, don't shoot
don't shoot!
The kid's gonna die!
We have to go quick!
Let's go!
Where's private LEE
you bastard!
I don't know sergeant
- Jin-tae!
- Only a few left
Let's finish them!
Jin-tae!
No, retreat! Now!
Jin-tae! Are you
out of your mind?
Hey! LEE Jin-tae
Quick, you bastard
He was shot in the stomach
and on his leg
Hold on
- Hurry up!
- Hold him tight!
Hold tight, you bastard
Take it easy
Seung-chul!
We must take him
to the hospital
Hey, you bastard! There's
no way to carry him out!
Sew him up right now!
- Hurry up
- Sew him up!
- What should I do with this?
- Hold on, bastard!
You okay?
LEE Jin-tae
I'll kill you if you
do that again
I mean it
One more minute
he would have died
Got it?
Why the hell did you
go for that mission?
Tell me
You weren't on the list
but you volunteered for it
Why is that?
I don't understand
why you did that
Just forget it
What if it was you
laying there
with your guts open!
Promise me
you won't do that again
Promise!
Alright
All I need is
just water
Why the hell are they
playing that music?
They know we're isolated
They're gonna drive us crazy
Remember the ice cream?
It was so good
Back home, you can eat it
till your teeth go numb
I wonder what mom
and Young-shin are doing...
I bet... Mom is really
worried about us
Uncle would be taking
good care of them
I miss them all
Young-guk, Young-ja
Young-min...
I should've...
set the dog free
- Seung-chul
- What's wrong?
Okay there?
Make him lie down
Uncle Yang...
my stomach hurts
Don't worry
You'll be okay
Where's my leg?
You call yourself doctor?
Don't see the maggots?
What are you good for?
Food?
Why no more?
Damn! It's about time!
Give us more!
Stop, you bastards!
My ears are exploding!
Are you gonna make us
go through hell?
You want to give up
Nak-dong River?
Seung-chul!
Seung-chul
Put it down
Seung-chul
Why couldn't you wait
just a little longer?
Dismiss
- Go back to the trench
- Shit!
We're going to die
here like dogs?
Starve to death
or shot to death
Who says we're gonna die?
They haven't given us food
or water for days!
We'll die
an honorable death
Soldiers are human, too!
What's the honor when
starving to death?
- Shut up!
- You crazy bastard
You'd go to them for
a piece of bread
It's better than
starving to death
Okay then, go on!
Go join the commies
I'll kill you before you get there
Surrendering is better than
starving to death like animals!
Who gives a shit who wins!
Is that ideology
important enough
to kill each other over?
You finished?
This is totally different from
our fight against Japan!
You damn communist!
Fuck, give back your badge!
You crazy fuck!
Stop it, son of a bitch
- Let go, let go!
- You son of a bitch!
Stop it, son of a bitch
Okay, let's die, you bastard
today, okay?
We're gonna die anyway
- Die, fucking bastard!
- Take it easy!
The communists slaughtered
- his entire family
- I didn't do it!
This ain't circus!
Go back to the bunker!
This is it?
Let's attack them
We're so weak we can
- barely lift our guns
- One more day
and we'll be eating corpses
Or surrender to
the commies
They wouldn't expect us
to attack them
We've got nothing to lose
haven't we?
Let's go in and
wipe them out
I will fight!
I will, too!
I will follow too
- I will go too
- I will go along
- I will go
- Hey, count me in
- I'll go too
- Me too
One mistake can
- kill us all
- Let's go and kill 'em all!
Sir!
I don't understand
why I'm out of the mission
You're not qualified
I am!
Let me join them!
- I have to be with my brother
- It's too late
I'm begging you, I want to
fight with others
Your brother begged me to sit you out
and now you wanna go?
What are you risking
your life for?
- You need a medal, too?
- What medal, sir?
Attack!
Attack!
Fucking bastard!
Fuck, kill 'em all!
Die all of you...
die!
Please... don't kill me
I'm only 15
I just got drafted
Please don't kill me
Please...
Die...
