I think,
always been good with words.
In my work is just as important,
to describe what I do,
as to do what I do.
When what to say,
what words to choose.
Some men hate certain statements.
They can not stand certain movements
and can not do without some other.
It is part of my work,
to know where I should place my hand.
My lips, my tongue, my leg
even my thoughts.
How much pressure, how long, when to stop.
I can be your first kiss.
Or a torn out picture from a Playboy,
you found your ninth.
I am your secretary,
or am I your daughter.
Maybe I'm your math teacher
from the seventh grade, you always hated.
I know that if I do well,
I am your living, breathing dream can be.
and then I can disappear.
Dr. Stewart?
Your last appointment is waiting.
- Okay, thank you Julie.
When was your first period?
On my fourteenth.
- And what is your profession?
I am a dancer.
- Oh yes, what kind of dancer?
Classical ballet.
Do you use contraception?
And would like a baby?
- No, definitely not, no.
Do you work on safe sex?
I've never had an orgasm.
You have ever slept with someone?
We are ready, thank you.
I have so far rarely had sex.
There is something that I do not understand.
An orgasm is simply
the contraction of certain muscles.
This is by manipulating the clitoris.
There is no mystery or magic about it.
I give you some literature about it, okay?
You may get dressed.
And this is the second scene in which Leporello
Giovanni's conquests opnoemt Thurs.
By country, by age, per figure.
Is she nice or mean,
a woman or a princess,
single or married,
eventually he says, it does not matter,
but if they wear skirts.
If we look at the title of this aria,
which is called...?
U.
- Madamina, il catalogo и questo.
What does he mean?
- Sir?
In Italy, 640, 231 in Germany,
Spain in 1003.
Beloved, that Don Giovanni alone
Spain conquered.
A very busy man.
A few of us would ask you to eat,
you have time?
I would like,
I am honored, but...
Today is my birthday
and a half hours I fly home.
Hello, how are you,
have you anything to drink?
Gifts to my office, okay?
You understand that I should murder,
if you would do this to me.
You're a very courageous wife.
I've changed my clothes 25 times,
is it good?
You look great.
- What time is it?
He has landed 40 minutes ago, so so.
Please.
- Thank you.
Michael, your dad is so,
Come with us.
Where is that boy stayed
in his mother's arms flew.
His girlfriend takes him down to graze
at this time.
That is terrible,
against a mother to say.
He does a lot better.
- Yes, that's right.
Trina, This is Catherine.
Our hostess and my colleagues in practice.
- Hi, nice.
What you have a beautiful home.
- Thank you.
That will be him.
Quiet everybody.
Hello darling, are you home?
- I'm a little late.
The airline said,
that your plane has landed.
I've just missed him.
And you said,
you could not pick me, so...
You know when you get home?
The next flight leaves in two hours,
You probably already asleep when I get back.
I am sorry
Catherine, dear.
Then we see each other when you return.
It seems that we who are surprised,
He has missed his flight.
Then we charter a plane
and we surprised him.
This was not part of the plan,
but that's no reason to stop, do you?
Michael, your girlfriend should go home
it's getting late.
I am sorry
- I had to tell you.
Yes, that's what you should do.
But it was no surprise been.
At my age, I try my birthdays
to ignore, it's so damn...
embarrassing?
The gifts are in my office,
The bottle of Scotch is mine.
I'm late again tonight,
a boring curriculum meeting.
Yes, but now you're not late.
- I'll go have a coffee.
Good morning.
Michael,
your mom is in the hall and she saw me naked.
Jesus Michael, this is not good.
I just came.
- You're lying.
I better go home.
Dad knows.
- Your father knows here?
It was all night in my house
and nobody tells me anything?
Anna, her name is Anna.
Do you use for contraception?
- We use condoms.
This does not happen every night,
Understand?
"Thanks for last night
Miranda.
See you guys later.
- Hey sweetheart, days.
Over here.
Hello.
Do your hair differently?
- Yes, David has not even noticed.
Because he has long preferred.
- How do you know?
That's what all men,
they imagine that their...
Frank that's enough.
- Sit down.
Sorry honey.
Hi David.
- Hello Frank.
I Dehlia, your waitress tonight,
what can I bring you a drink?
What would you like to drink Dehlia?
- I?
I like the Maybach Vineyard
with a deep intense pure flavor.
Then we take it.
A good choice.
- And you?
The same love.
Where is the toilet?
Frank?
Oh, there.
Is everything okay?
- Yes, everything is fine, thank you
Can I help you?
There is no toilet paper.
- Here's something.
Please.
Men are assholes.
- Yes.
Thank you.
- No thanks.
I think you've dropped.
That is not mine.
Take it anyway.
Why?
I want you to have it.
I must return to my husband.
Frank has discovered a whore.
- Great.
This is a nice hotel with lots of horny
and wealthy businessmen from outside,
This is a sexy situation.
They mingle among the ordinary people.
- They are normal people.
I do not know how normal they are.
- Have you ever had d'r?
I?
- What do I do.
It's not a habit.
I like to pay.
- Stop it.
If you have some dusting and want to be purged
without emotional consequences
To prevent rejection and women
sitting behind you, then you pay for it.
Loved that sexy waitress?
- What?
That you're flirting.
- Come on, I was just friendly.
The people are always so rude
against the staff.
And then you're extra nice,
to make it good.
Got to run to get the plane?
- What?
You said you just missed him,
so you should have run.
It was close a few minutes.
Did you intentionally missed the flight?
What does it matter whether I accidentally,
or intentionally missed.
Because you said it was accidental,
and your birthday was.
A birthday surprise.
It was not intentional and not accidental,
it just happened.
Are you being a little drink?
What would you drink?
; - A glass of Chardonnay please.
Of course.
Give me something to drink?
What do you want?
What do you drink?
Please.
- Another chardonnay for her, please.
I normally do not more women.
Couples, but...
women only...
Thank you.
I think my husband you should.
Looking for his wife before him?
Can not he come?
Why not?
What's your name?
My husband cheating on me.
At least I think so.
I want to know what he does,
if you present yourself to him.
Most of my clients are married.
He is not a customer.
How does he look like?
He is big,
strong, he has brown hair.
He is very handsome.
David lunch usually
in the Cafй Diplomatico.
He usually reads the newspaper.
If he asks what I do for work,
what do you want me to say?
Say you are a student
studying and interpreting.
Do you speak other languages?
- A little Japanese.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Sorry, can I borrow your sugar?
- Of course.
Thank you.
Recognized not you take me?
I was not sure.
I met him.
Like you said, he read the newspaper
and I'm going to ask him sugar.
And he pretended to read the newspaper and...
He stood up and came towards me
and asked if I was a student
and I said I studied languages,
like you said, Japanese.
And he said,
or I could say something in Japanese,
so I blushed
and I said;
'Konnichiwa'
And then he asked my name
and I said Chloe.
Well, that's okay.
Nothing happened.
- Except that he appealed to you.
A beautiful girl in a cafe.
He flirted scarcely
He was just friendly.
He's cute.
How can you do this?
I try to find something fun everyone.
If only something small.
How someone smiles.
There's always something,
it should be.
I try to be generous
and I do things I do not want to do.
I concentrate on things
who do not bother
It happened to me unusual things.
- Like what?
You.
I?
Yes, people like you
who walk into my life.
The money is in the envelope.
I want to do it again,
to see what he does.
And then we stop it, okay?
Okay.
Listen, we're not engaged or anything, okay?
If other guys are
has nothing to do with you.
I gotta see, this is...
This is strange.
- You see me.
I mean personally,
This is all nonsense.
We still talk to each other personally,
let's...
When people break up,
there must be someone else.
I do not think...
The exams are coming
and I would not feel bound by you,
or whatever.
Damn it, Mom.
Who are you online?
- With one of my students,
We have just finished anyway.
Our son was dumped.
How do you know?
I do not know what bothers me more,
he sleeps on her, or not exactly.
Have you talked to him?
- He is not talking to me.
Catherine, this is okay.
I do not know,
how his mother must be.
It'll be all right.
He gets therapy
He...
- Did you know that his girlfriend sleep over?
Come on, you know what it was?
Shall we go and test?
No, I have a headache.
- Take one tablet.
I already did.
- Take two.
Nectar Oh, here.
Thank you for the Scotch
and thank you for the small party.
I love your smile.
- That's not true.
Why do not we get more
from the airport?
No idea.
And together waiting at the gate.
I try to remember
when that happened.
After the tightening of security.
- Really?
No idea.
We just got busier and busier.
What?
I still read papers
and correct for tomorrow.
Yes, you better get to work.
- Is everything okay?
Yes, of course.
Yes Dad, it's rather odd do you know
When Anne and I met was the...
I've never felt for someone...
did you feel the same with Mom, Dad?
When you met?
I always asked you to tell that story.
That they are the most beautiful woman,
you've ever seen
and that it was all that was not what you...
"Meet me at Rivoli.
Chloe.
There you are.
- Hey, they are great.
I'm sorry, I did think I
a weird phase of uncertainty
or a midlife crisis or something,
let us forget.
But I've already done.
- The password?
No, I've already met him.
- You've met him? Where?
I was in the cafe and I approached him,
as you asked and we had lunch.
Wait, you have lunch with my husband?
- Yes, it was kind of a picnic...
We bought sandwiches
and I asked about his teaching.
And he started talking about his music.
And he stared at me.
And then?
Then he asked if he could kiss me.
I have not asked you.
But he said he could not kiss me,
because he is married.
He hesitated at first.
- First...
And then...
he asked where we could kiss
no one would see us and...
And I said we at Allan Gardens
could go, the park across the street,
with that big greenhouse.
Should I quit?
We walked through those big long corridor
with exotic flowers.
There was nobody else.
I love Allan Gardens.
It's always so hot
and the air feels so good to.
It's like suddenly
in another country.
I know there is a back place,
where they store equipment.
There is no one.
It's like a secret hiding place.
He brought his mouth to my lips,
We have stayed quite long.
I could feel his excitement through his pants.
- That's enough.
You had to take my husband,
and see what he was doing and then report.
I do not know what you want.
I told you not to be involved,
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry, I wanted to pull away,
all is well with your bumper?
I'm sorry, you just move forward?
Did you this bag around with you in the car?
You never know when you need it.
Let him not destroy cut.
I put him off.
Hold this, it stops the bleeding.
I am sorry
Is that a scar?
- No, I do not expect.
We were deep in the forest
of exotic plants and trees.
And we heard voices in the distance,
but we were confident that nobody could see us.
And I pushed with my hand in his pants
and felt him.
And then I moved my hand up and down.
Exactly.
And I kept working on my hand
in his pants and...
He said he could not come,
because he had his job.
But I did not stop.
And when I bite his tongue.
And when he finished in my hand.
And then?
Then he had to his work,
and he walked away.
I do not mean to be rude...
I want to be sure that you are healthy.
I have a national test.
All, including HIV, venereal diseases
and let me see the results.
Okay, yeah.
Can I help you?
I am looking for Catherine.
Dr Stewart now has a patient,
What time did you meet?
I have an appointment, we are friends.
Okay, so they will be coming.
Would you sit?
- Okay.
Hi Michael.
Your mother is still in with a patient.
- I just want to pick up my tuxedo.
Who is in her office.
An exciting recital tonight eh?
Yes, I need some music to copy.
Dr Stewart's your mom?
My mother is your obstetrician?
You look like her.
I?
I think not.
- Yes, you have the same look in your eyes.
Not the color or shape, but...
The look.
And your lips too.
I'm Chloe Sweeny.
I'm Michael Stewart.
- Nice.
Are you a musician?
No, for me just to hear, I think.
Study music.
I wish I had attended.
Me love music.
Classic?
Raised by Swans.
Do you know the band Raised by Swans not?
You'll find them well.
You'll really like them.
Those were my appointments huh?
Manny's motors called,
your car is ready.
Alicia and rang for lunch to two hours.
- Exactly.
And your son is behind the copy.
Hello doctor.
Please, everything complete.
Okay, thank you for bringing long.
Can I talk to you?
No, it does not work, I'm stuck,
when you call...
Yes, briefly then.
That's my son.
You did not speak to him?
- I came to tell you about this afternoon.
That's today.
Today?
- Yes, after lunch.
Got my tuxedo?
Thank you.
I'm excited.
- Why?
Because tonight, to see you play.
I have a lucky charm in your pocket.
Okay.
Thank you Mom.
- What you said.
She lies every night to propose
she sees her children every week
and she says she can not handle.
- So she stays with him.
She tries to present
just to survive.
"Windsor Arms, room 211.
Chloe.
Who was that?
- A patient.
What happened to you on?
- Nothing.
Listen, I understand.
Especially if David will miss flights.
David is okay, we have spoken.
He missed his flight, that's all.
He is not the most organized man.
No, I'm talking about you.
- Who did you meet?
I?
No, oh God no.
It is written on your forehead.
Who got pregnant patient in panic,
when a spade or a krampje feel
because she is afraid to become a mother.
I have decided to support it.
I have to call back, it's important.
We were done anyway, right?
Thanks for lunch,
Goodbye.
No, no.
Go sit in that chair.
Okay, but far.
We met again in the park affected.
This time he did not take sandwiches,
We took this room.
He took the news
and pretended he was interested.
I sat down beside him.
He turned and looked at me
and kissed me.
And whispered, let's fuck.
Jesus.
He got him up.
He has tried several times.
He was ashamed,
but I said it did not matter.
I thought it was good,
because then we could wait a bit.
He was fully dressed
and I completely naked.
Are you excited about here?
He wanted to stay dressed.
He sat on the bench.
I had to come between his legs.
I put it in my mouth
and he was stiff.
Is everything okay?
I think I know what the members have.
Have you been to a doctor?
No, it's nothing,
me take zinc.
He finished in your mouth?
I pulled him out,
did a condom
and sat on him.
He was almost ready.
After he pushed me inside.
I pushed my breasts against his face.
Want tallying?
No, it's okay.
That zinc does it?
If you start early with it.
What perfume is that?
It is a lotion.
Here.
We always did everything together.
We could not prevent
to not be together.
Not even hours.
We wait together,
if the other had an appointment.
We loved the moments of waiting,
because we saw each other again.
Could touch each other.
I loved his hands.
They took me everywhere.
So it was.
I was younger.
Did you ever lived with someone?
Do you still love him?
I do not know.
One more thing.
He said he was doing this for the first time.
- That's a lie.
Jesus.
I do not know whether I should have been relieved,
or to go hang myself.
Damn.
I can not.
Congratulations.
- What?
With your wonderful son.
He looks at you.
- No, it looks like you, that you know.
What is that?
Do you wear perfume?
It is a lotion.
- It smells good.
Professor Stewart.
Madeleine,
how are you?
How does he do it?
What?
You touch them.
Oh God.
But stop here.
Do you live here?
Which house is yours?
- Over there.
This is her journey home.
Meet my husband anymore, please.
Wait...
I got something for you.
You must take.
- I told you it is yours.
No, this was my mother.
I want you to have.
Did you intentionally drop?
I wanted to talk to you.
I gotta go.
Do you want me not see?
I do not know, we work in the same neighborhood,
we will meet down in the street.
Will you see me in the street?
- So not what I meant-I mean...
that came out wrong.
I am exhausted.
Who is it?
Are you in love?
If so, it makes any difference?
- Of course it makes a difference.
Are you love?
You were the whole night away
and now I am questioned?
Right, I forgot,
you are discreet with your women
You will not leave home.
You know how.
I love women,
I appreciate their beauty, their intelligence,
that does not mean I fuck them.
How do you feel that your office if I
you come in and chat with a student?
I ask myself available to my students,
if I win their confidence, as I teach.
You will not agree to.
- What in?
You flirt with every woman you meet,
may you ever fuck with everybody.
I have no option.
- Stop it.
Go to your room.
- Should I go to my room?
Leave us alone.
- You can not order me.
Michael, that's enough.
I can not wait,
here to escape.
I was detained in hospital.
- Is it?
Is it?
There was an urgent call from Mrs. Beatrice
because her hormone treatment.
Mrs. Carmical again has a fungal infection.
And these are just before you come
and there is an urgent e-mail.
I'll be there.
Oh my God.
Chloe.
- Where are you?
I'm in your waiting room,
you saw me when you came?
Smell.
What are you doing?
I am sorry
I am sorry.
Why?
You're amazing.
You are so beautiful.
We're so far gone as I wanted.
I liked it.
Yesterday night.
I,
I can not say that it is not.
I would not think it's over.
And I think you will not.
- Do you want money?
This is not about money.
You took money from me,
So since when is not about money?
That should be enough for everything.
This is not business,
this is real and you know it.
And then last night, I got you and...
- How do I do this to make sense?
This business transaction,
what this was, is over.
And now you outta here.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm so sorry.
Over here.
- Shoot.
Come on.
- Stewart, two minutes penalty box.
I have the CD which we spoke,
Raised by Swans brought in.
Thank you.
What?
I've already downloaded their albums.
The box you have not downloaded
or cover
and the CD you can keep forever
and can hold in your hands.
I hate the internet.
Nothing is private,
nothing is real, like you and me
who meet in the penalty area.
Do you have a homepage?
I knew it, I saw him,
I knew that you had to play today.
A beautiful picture.
- I'm not that photogenic.
Yes.
I think that picture of your beautiful mother.
It says there is no picture of my mother.
She is not in the background,
if you receive that price?
Yes, but she is not keen on.
- Yes, that's right.
I notice everything.
Goodbye.
Mom.
- Jesus.
How did you get that music?
- From the shop.
Have you talked with that girl?
- What girl?
Those in my office?
- What are you talking about?
Is she here?
Where is she?
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
"I just left him.
Chloe.
I do not know.
I am sorry
I said you had to call my husband.
I have not called,
He has called me.
I still do not contact him.
When he rang, it was not about sex.
It was about feelings
and vulnerability.
He says that if he touches you,
it feels as if he deceives me.
Is not that weird?
Did you hear me?
Take me about one hour,
in the Cafй Diplomatico.
What's going on?
- You want some order?
I have oral tests.
- This will not last long.
Coffee please.
- I take cognac.
And one for my wife Hennessy.
What is this over?
I wanted to give us the opportunity,
the cards on the table.
I want us to tell each other everything,
the truth.
Is there something you want to tell me?
I?
- Say it plain.
About New York?
- Okay.
I lied.
I did not want birthday
another day closer to my retirement,
So I left, I had a drink,
even three.
By Miranda.
No.
- Yes, you.
You listen my message.
- What have you done to her?
You spying on me.
- I have your party planned for months.
I have secretly called our friends,
I've spent thousands of dollars
the cake, the catering and flowers.
I play the super housewife
and you fucks a 18jarige, I'm an idiot.
I fucked her,
I flirted with her.
Damn.
What?
What?
What, Who is that girl?
Nobody.
She nobody.
It's over.
That was it?
Wait, you came here,
all cards on the table.
I am the only one who has admitted something.
, I can not explain it,
it was so sudden, so unexpected
and it's over now.
- And now I rejoice,
small affair with your midlife crisis?
- There was no affair.
Please Catherine,
How often did I not tempted
and I've never done anything, ever.
No, but you wanted it.
- I am a man.
You're saying you are different?
- I never want to be with someone else.
You lie to me.
You fucking lying.
You pulled me away from my work,
You asked me to be honest
and you have not told me.
Wait, David.
Sorry friend.
I tell you,
she said that her name was Chloe.
That girl, I asked her to seduce you.
I want to know what you would do,
because I thought you had an affair.
I do not cheat.
- I know.
But she said that she had slept with you.
- What? This is ridiculous.
She took my money
and lied about sex with you.
I found her and she told me every detail.
What then?
- Stories.
She said it started
with a picnic in the park.
And Allan Gardens, greenhouse.
She said she had kissed you
and she felt that you got excited.
It was...
confusing.
I felt so close to you.
You're prettier every year.
Every gray hair, every wrinkle,
everything happens to you
makes you covet worthy
and I feel I solution,
if you against me blows. I disappear.
I felt so invisible and so old.
I've slept with her.
We previously had sex three times a day.
and then every day
and then once a week and then
Michael was born and we became parents
and we were best friends and I knew
not how I had to be your lover.
You hit me anymore.
- David, I could not respect myself.
I did not know who I was.
I think I'm 19
and I look in the mirror and I...
am someone who does not know
how to seduce you should.
Show me the house once.
I want not only leave, but I'm late
and they murder me in school.
I'll be there, I wait at home for you.
I'm sorry,
I do not trust.
Come home soon.
Where is the room of your parents?
- It's over.
What are you doing?
Look at me.
Damn.
Come on.
Michael, get out.
Come, let's go.
Think you can buy me
and then I go?
Do you think if you give me money,
I pretend that nothing has been?
Michael, I do not want you hear this,
Go away. Please go.
Leave my son alone.
He is not yours, your man is not yours,
I am not yours.
We do not know what you're saying, if you pay us
and if you want us
and if you want to go.
Yes, I understand that it was a mistake,
to get you involved in my marriage,
but you should stay away from his.
- I felt you in him, in his eyes
and the little things he does.
I think he's a good friend
for me can be, for going out.
My husband can come home anytime.
- Is everything okay with David?
Are you all right between you?
I have my job well done?
I make sure you dress,
I take you home and then we talk further.
You liked it.
I'm sorry,
I have given you false hope.
No, that's not true.
Pardon?
- Sorry your not.
You shared your secrets with me.
- Okay.
We created our own world.
You said no no, you let me fall in love.
I did not want that, I felt something,
but that was for my husband.
You would not have recovered your husband,
If I had not been there.
Let's go home.
- How can you inflict it,
I mean nothing to you?
God, I did not want.
Please, let me take you home.
Stop.
You're beautiful
that you know.
That you are real.
Tell me what you want.
I want you to kiss me.
No.
- Oh my God.
