There was a boy
A very strange
enchanted boy
They say he wandered
very far
Very far
Overland and sea
A little shy
- Turn away from this village of sin,
-And sad of eye
for it is a veritable
Sodom and Gomorrah.
But very wise
Was he
And then one day
A magic day
He passed my way
And while we spoke
of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
The greatest thing
You'll ever learn
Is just to love
The Moulin Rouge.
A nightclub.
A dancehall and a bordello...
- The Moulin Rouge!
-ruled over by Harold Zidler.
A kingdom
of nighttimepleasures,
where the rich and powerful
came to play with the young
and beautiful creatures...
of the underworld.
The most beautiful
of all these...
was the woman I loved.
Satine.
A courtesan,
she sold herlove to men.
They called her
''the sparkling diamond, ''
and she was the star...
of the Moulin Rouge.
The woman I loved...
is...
dead.
-
- I first came to Paris...
one year ago.
It was 1899,
the summer of love.
I knew nothing of the Moulin Rouge,
Harold Zidler...
or Satine.
The world had been swept up
in bohemian revolution,
and I had traveled from London
to be a part of it.
On the hill near Paris
was the village of Montmartre.
- It was not, as my father had said--
- A village of sin!
But the center
of the bohemian world.
-  Of the revolution
- Musicians, painters, writers.
They were known as
''the children of the revolution. ''
and that which I believed in
above all things--love.
Always this ridiculous
obsession with love!
There was only one problem--
I'd never been in love.
-
- Luckily, right at that moment,
an unconscious Argentinean
fell through my roof.
He was quickly joined
by a dwarf dressed as a nun.
How do you do?
My name is Henri Marie Raymond
Toulouse-Lautrec Monfa.
- What?
- I'm terribly sorry about all this.
- We were just upstairs
rehearsing a play.
- What?
A play, something very modern
called Spectacular Spectacular.
- And it's set in Switzerland.
- Unfortunately,
the unconscious Argentinean...
suffered from a sickness
called narcolepsy.
Perfectly fine one moment,
then suddenly--
unconscious the next.
-
-How is he?
Wonderful. Now the narcoleptic
Argentinean is now unconscious.
Therefore, the scenario will not
be finished in time to present
to the financier tomorrow.
He's right, Toulouse.
I still have to finish the music.
- Find someone to read the part.
- Where in heaven's name are we
going to find someone...
to read the role of a young,
sensitive Swiss poet/goatherder?
Before I knew it, I was upstairs,
standing in for
the unconscious Argentinean.
The hills animate
With the euphonious symphonies
of descant
Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha
Oh, stop, stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Stop that insufferable droning.
It's drowning out my words.
Can we please just stick
to a little decorative piano?
There seemed to be artistic differences
over Audrey's lyrics to Satie's songs.
I don't think a nun
would say that about a hill.
What if he sings, ''The hills are vital,
intoning the descant''?
- No, no. The hills quake and shake.
- No, no, no, no. The hills--
The hills are incarnate
with symphonic melodies!
- No.
- No. The hills--
- The hills--
- The hills--
Are chanting
the eternal mantra.
Frank is living in my foot.
The hills are alive
With the sound
Of music
Whoa!
The hills are alive with
the sound of music! I love it!
- The hills are alive--
- With the sound--
Of music
It fits perfectly.
With songs
they have sung
For a thousand years
-
- Incandiferous!
-Audrey, you two should
write the show together.
- I beg your pardon?
But Toulouse's suggestion that Audrey
and I write the show together...
- was not what Audrey wanted to hear.
- Good-bye!
Here's toyour first job
in Paris.
Toulouse, Zidler
will never agree.
No offense, but have you ever
written anything like this before?
- No.
- Ahh!
- The boy has talent!
-
I like him! Nothing funny.
I just like talent.
The hills are alive
with the sound of music.
See, Satie, with Christian
we can write...
the truly bohemian revolutionary show
that we've always dreamt of.
- But how will we convince Zidler?
- But Toulouse had a plan.
- Satine.
- They would dress me in
the Argentinean's best suit...
and pass me off
as a famous English writer.
Once Satine heard my modern poetry,
she would be astounded...
and insist to Zidler that I
write Spectacular Spectacular.
The only problem was, I kept hearing
my father's voice in my head.
You'll end up wasting your life
at the Moulin Rouge...
with a cancan dancer!
- No, I can't write the show
for the Moulin Rouge!
- Why not?
- I don't even know if I am
a true bohemian revolutionary.
- What?
- Do you believe in beauty?
- Yes.
- Freedom?
- Yes, ofcourse.
- Truth?
- Yes.
- Love?
Love? Love.
Above all things,
I believe in love.
Love is like oxygen.
Love is a many-splendored thing.
Love lifts us up where we belong.
All you need is love.
See, you can't fool us.
You're the voice of the children
of the revolution!
We can't be fooled!
Let's drink to the new writer
of the world's first bohemian
revolutionary show!
It was the perfect plan.
I was to audition for Satine,
and I would taste my first
glass of... absinthe.
There was a boy
I'm the green fairy.
The hills are alive
With the sound ofmusic
A very strange
enchanted boy
Yeah, freedom, beauty
Truth and love
- The hills are alive
-  No, you won't fool the
children of the revolution
-  No, you won't fool the children
- With the sound ofmusic
-  Of the revolution
- We were off to the Moulin Rouge.
And I was to perform
my poetry for Satine.
Yaaah!
Harold Zidler
and his infamous girls.
- They called them his ''Diamond Dogs. ''

Psst, psst.
Mission accomplished.
We successfully
evaded Zidler.
Cancan, cancan
Cancan, cancan
It's her,
the sparkling diamond.
The French are glad
To die
For love
They delight
In fighting duels
But someone else
was to meet Satine that night.
But I prefer a man
Who lives
Zidler's investor.
And gives expensive jewels
The Duke.
A kiss on the hand
- Oh, my!
-  May be quite continental
But diamonds are
a girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand, but it
- Wow!
- Won't pay the rental
on your humble flat
Or help you feed
your pussycat
Men grow cold
as girls grow old
And we all lose our charms
in the end
But square-cut
or pear-shaped
These rocks
don't lose their shape
Diamonds are
a girl's best friend
- When am I going to meet the girl?
- Tiffany's!
After her number,
I've arranged a special meeting,
just you
and Mademoiselle Satine.
- Totally alone.
- Cartier.
After her number,
I have arranged a private meeting,
just you and Mademoiselle Satine
totally alone.
- Alone?
-
- Yes, totally alone.
- Totally alone.
'Cause we are living
In a material world
And I am a material girl
Come and get me, boys.
- Ow!
- Oh, my.
Excuse me.
- Black Star, Roscor.
-
Talk to me, Harry Zidler.
Tell me all about it.
There may come a time
- When a lass needs a lawyer
- Ohh!
But diamonds are
a girl's best friend
There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer
- Thinks you're-- Aah!
- Awfully nice
Don't worry, don't worry.
I'll sally forth and tee things up.
-
- Ohh!
- Is the Duke here, Harold?
- Liebchen, would Daddy let you down?
-
- Terribly sorry!
- Where is he?
- He's the one Toulouse
is shaking a hanky at.
Excuse me, Christian.
May I borrow?
Diamonds are a girl's best
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
- Are you sure?
- Let me peek.
Let me finish. I'm ever so sorry!
It's so embarrassing.
- That's the one, chickpea.
-
I hope that demonic little loon
doesn't frighten him off.
Clean yourself off, you bourgeois pig!
Sorry. Sorry.
- Will he invest?
- Pigeon!
After spending the night with you,
how could he refuse?
What's his type?
Wilting flower, hmm?
Bright and bubbly?Ah!
Or smoldering temptress?
I'd say smoldering temptress.
We're all relying on you, gosling.
-
- Ole!
Remember, a real show
in a real theater,
with a real audience.
- And you'll be--
- A real actress.
-  'Cause that's when those louses
- Ooh!
- Go back to their spouses
- Be jeweled vision!
- Amazonian goddess!
-Diamonds
- Are a
- I've got some exciting news!
Girl's
Best
Friend
- I believe you are expecting me.
- Yes. Yes.
I'm afraid
it's lady's choice!
-
-  Aw!
-
Satine!Satine!Satine!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Satine! Satine! Satine! Satine!
-
I see you've already met
my English friend.
I'll take care of it, Toulouse.
Let's dance.
Hit her with your most
modern poem!
-
-Feel the beat
of the rhythm of the night
-  Dance until the morning light
- Ow!
You can leave them
all behind
Feel the beat
of the rhythm of the night
-Dance until the morning light
-
- You can leave them all behind
- That seemed to go well.
- Incredible.
- He has a gift with the women.
I told you,
he's a genius.
Whoo! Whoo!
That Duke
certainly can dance.
So wonderful of you to take
an interest in our little show.
It sounds very exciting.
I'd be delighted to be involved.
- Really?
- Assuming you like
what I do, of course.
I'm sure I will.
- Oh-ho!
- Toulouse thought
we might be able to, um,
do it in private.
- Did he?
- Yes, you know, uh, a private...
-
- poetry reading.
Ohh!
Mmm, a poetry reading.
Oh, I love a little poetry
after supper.
Entertain us
Here we are now
entertain us
-  'Cause we're stupid
- Hang on to your hat!
Diamonds
Hah! Hah!
Diamonds
Square-cut
or pear-shaped
These rocks won't lose
Their shape
Diamonds
- Fantastic!
- Are a girl's
Best--
No!
Satine!Satine!Satine!Satine!
Don't know if that Duke's gonna get
his money's worth tonight.
Don't be unkind, Nini.
She fainted,just fainted.
Satine!Satine!
Satine!Satine!Satine!Satine!
Satine! Satine!
Satine! Satine!
- You frightened her away!
-
But I can see some lonely
Moulin Rouge dancers...
looking for
a partner or two!
-
- So if you can Hunk-Hunk,
youcan Hunkadola with them!
-All together, now!
- Out of my way. Quickly.
Oh, Marie.
Oh, these silly costumes.
-Just a little fainting spell.
- All right, you girls.
Get back out front and make
those gents thirsty. Problems?
- Nothing for you to be worrying about.
- Don't just stand around.
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death
in the fog
Young girls
- They call them the Diamond Dogs
- Yaah!
Find Zidler.
The girl's waiting for me.
-
- That twinkle-toes Duke
has really taken the bait, girl.
With a patron like him,
you could be the next Sarah Bernhardt.
Oh, Marie, do you really think
I could be like the great Sarah?
Why not?
You've got the talent.
You hook that Duke, and you'll be
lighting up the great stages of Europe.
I'm gonna be a real actress, Marie.
A great actress.
I'm gonna fly away from here.
Oh, yes, we can fly, fly away from here!
- Duckling, is everything all right?
- Oh, yes.
- Ofcourse, Harold.
- Oh, thank goodness.
You certainly weaved your magic
with that duke on the dance floor.
- How do I look?
-
- Smoldering temptress.
- Oh, my little strawberry!
How could he possibly resist
from gobbling you up?
Everything's going so well!
I'll meet you
in the red room
- Close the door and dim the lights
- Unbelievable!
Straight to the elephant!
This is a wonderful place
for a poetry reading.
Don't you think?
Hmm?
- Poetic enough for you?
- Yes.
A little, uh, supper?
Maybe some champagne?
I'd rather just, um,
get it over and done with.
Oh.
Very well.
Then why don'tyou...
come down here?
Let's get it
over and done with.
I-I prefer
to do it standing.
- Oh.
- You don't have to stand.
It's sometimes
that it's quite long,
and I'd like you
to be comfortable.
It's quite modern what I do, and it
may feel a little strange at first,
but I think if you're open,
then you might enjoy it.
- I'm sure I will.
- Excuse me.
The--
The sky is-- is--
with thebluebirds.
I know. Come on.
Come on.
-
- I think--
There might be some shaking.
Oh, riki-tiki-tiki-tiki.
Um, is everything allright?
Um, I'm a little nervous.
- It's just sometimes
it takes a while for,
- Oh!
you know,
inspiration to come.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Let Mummy help, hmm?
- Does that inspire you?
-
-
- Let's make love.
- Make love?
- You want to, don't you?
- Well, I came to--
- No, tell the truth.
- Can't you feel the poetry?
- What?
Whoa!
Oh, come on.
- Feel it.
-
- Free the tiger!
- Oh!
Big boy.
He's got a huge talent!
Yes, I need your poetry now!
- All right.
-
- It's a little bit funny.
- What?
This f-feeling inside.
I'm not one of those who can--
who can easily hide.
Is this-- Is this okay?
Is this what you want?
Oh, poetry. Yes.
Yes. Yes, this is whatI want,
naughty words.
Oh!
- I-- I don't have much money,
- Oh, naughty!
-but, boy, if I did,
- Oh, yes!
- I'd buy a big house
where we both could live.
- Oh, I love them.
- Oh, it's so good!
- IfI were a sculptor--
- Wonderful.
- But then again, no.
- Wonderful.
- Or a man who makes potions
at a traveling show.
Oh, don't! Don't!
- No, no, no. Don't stop.
- I know it's not much.
Give me more!
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Oh!
- But it's the best I can do.
- Oh, naughty! Don't stop!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
My gift is my song
And this one's for you
And you can tell
everybody
That this is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
Hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down
in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world
Sat on the roof
And I kicked off the moss
Well, some of these verses
Well, they
they got me quite cross
But the sun's been kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you
That keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see, I've forgotten
If they're green
or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are
the sweetest eyes
I've ever seen
And you can tell
everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down
in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're
in the world
Looks like he got the job!
World
Oh.
I can't believe it.
I'm in love.
I'm in love with a young,
handsome, talented duke.
-
- Duke?
Not that the title's
important, ofcourse.
I'm not a duke.
- Not a duke?
- I'm a writer.
- A writer?
- Yes, a writer.
-No!
- Toulouse?
- Toulouse?
Oh, no. You're not another of Toulouse's
oh-so-talented, charmingly bohemian,
- tragically impover is hedproteges?
- You might say that, yes.
Oh, no!
- I'm going to kill him!
I'm going to kill him!
- There might be a small hitch.
- Toulouse told me--
- What about the Duke?
- My dear Duke!
-  The Duke!
- The Duke?
- Hide! Out the back!
My dear, are you decent
for the Duke?
Where were you?
Mmm. I, uh--
- I was waiting.
- Dearest Duke.
Allow me to introduce
Mademoiselle Satine.
Mmm, monsieur, how wonderful
of you to take time out of
your busy schedule to visit.
The pleasure, I fear,
will be entirely mine, my dear.
I'll leave you two squirrels
to get better acquainted. Ta-ta.
A kiss on the hand
maybe quite continental--
But diamonds are a girl's best friend.
- Mmm.
- Woof.
Oh. Well.
After tonight's
pretty exertions on the stage,
you must surely be in need
of refreshment, my dear.
Don't! You...
just...
love the view, hmm?
Charming.
Oh! Oh.
I feel like dancing!
Yoo! Whoo-whoo!
-
-
Uh-- Uh-- Um-- Um--
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoo!
- You see, I should like
a glass of champagne.
- No!
It's--
It's a little bit funny.
- What is?
- This...
- Feeling.
- feeling...
- Inside.
- inside.
-  I'm not one of those--
- I'm not one of those...
- who can easily... hide!
-
No!
I don't have much money,
but if I did,
oh, I'd buy a big house...
where we both could live.
-
-  I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down
in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in
The world
That's very beautiful.
It's from
Spectacular Spectacular.
Suddenly, with you here,
I finally understood
the true meaning of those words.
''How wonderful life is
now you're in the world. ''
What meaning is that,
my dear?
No, no!
Duke!
Don't you toy
with my emotions.
You-- You must know the effect
you have on women.
Let's make love!
You want to make love,
don't you?
- Make love?
- Mmm!
I knew you felt the same way!
Oh! Oh, Duke!
Get out of here or he'll kill you.
Yes, you're right.
We should wait until opening night.
Wait? Wait?Uh--
There's a power in you
that scares me.
- You should go.
- I just got here.
Yes, but we'll see each other
every day during rehearsal.
We-We must wait.
We must wait until opening night.
Get out.
Do you have any idea--
any idea what would have happened...
if you were found--
Oh! Oh, my G--
Satine.
-
- Let's have a little peekaboo.
Oh, right on target.
Right. I'll put her in bed.
I'll put you in bed.
Oh!
I forgot my hat.
- Foul play?
- She--
- Oh, Duke.
- It's a little bit funny,
this feeling inside.
Beautifully spoken, Duke.
Yes, let me introduce you. The writer.
- The writer?
- Yes, we were rehearsing.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
You expect me to believe that scantily
clad, in the arms of another man,
in the middle of the night,
inside an elephant, you were rehearsing?
How's the rehearsal going?
- Shall we take it from the top, eh?
- I hope the piano's in tune.
-Sorry. Got held up.
- Can I offer you a drink?
Oh, my goodness!
When I spoke those words to you
before, you--you filled me
with such inspiration.
Yes, I realized how much work we
had to do, so I called everyone
for an emergency rehearsal.
If you're rehearsing,
where's Zidler?
- We didn't bother Harold.
- My dear Duke, I'm most terribly sorry.
Harold, you made it. It's all right.
The Duke knows about
the emergency rehearsal.
- Emergency rehearsal?
- Mmm, to incorporate
the Duke's artistic idea.
- Hmm?
- I'm sure Audrey will be
only too delighted--
- Audrey's left.
- He's what?
- The cat's out of the bag.
Yes, the Duke's already a big fan
of our new writer's work.
- That's why he's so keen to invest.
- Invest?
Invest!
Oh, yes, well, invest!
You can hardly blame me
for trying to hide, uh--
- Christian.
- Christian away.
- I'm way ahead of you, Zidler.
- My dear Duke.
Why don't you and I go to my office
to peruse the paperwork?
- What's the story?
- The story?
Well, if I'm to invest,
I'll need to know the story.
Ah, yes.
Well, the story's about--
Toulouse?
Well, the story's-- the story's about--
- Well, it's-it's about--
- It's about love.
- Love?
- It's about love
overcoming all obstacles.
And it's set in Switzerland!
- Switzerland?
- Exotic Switzerland!
India. India!
It's set in India!
And there's a courtesan.
The most beautiful courtesan
in all the world.
But her kingdom's invaded
by an evil maharajah!
In order to save her kingdom,
she has to seduce the evil maharajah.
But on the night
of the seduction,
she mistakes a penniless--
a penni--
pennilesssitarplayer...
for the evil maharajah,
and she falls in love with him.
He wasn't trying to trick her
or anything, but he was
dressed as a maharajah...
because he's appearing
in a play.
I will play penniless
tango-dancing sitar player.
He will sing like an angel,
but dance like the devil.
Yes. Yes, all right.
And what happens next?
Well, the penniless sitar player
and the courtesan,
they have to hide their love
from the evil maharajah.
The penniless sitar player's sitar is
magical. It can only speak the truth.
And-And I will play
the magical sitar.
-
-  You are beautiful.
You are ugly.
-And you are--
-
- And he gives the game away?
- Yes!
- Tell him about the cancan.
- The-The tantric cancan--
It's an erotic spectacular scene
that captures the thrusting,
violent, vibrant,
wild bohemian spirit...
that this whole production
embodies, Duke.
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean the show will be...
a magnificent, opulent,
tremendous, stupendous,
gargantuan bedazzlement,
a sensual ravishment.
- It will be...
-
Spectacular Spectacular!

- No one'sgoing to.
-  So exciting, we'll make them
laugh, we'll make them cry
-  So delighting
- And in the end, should someone die?
So exciting, the audience
will stomp and cheer
So delighting
it will run for 50
Years
Generally, I like it.
Zidler had an investor,
and the bohemians
had a show.
The end of the century!
The bohemian revolution
is here!
-
- You won't fool the children
of the revolution
-No, you won't fool
the children of the revolution
- You're a beautiful woman.
- I love sex.
-No, no
While the celebration
party raged upstairs, I tried to write.
But all I could
think about was her.
How wonderful life is
Was she thinking about me?
Now you're in
The world
Duke?I'm not a duke.
I'm a writer.
He wasn't trying to trick her
or anything. It's about love.
It's aboutlove...
over coming all obstacles.
I
Follow
The night
Can't stand
The light
When will I begin
To live again
One day I'll fly away
Leave all this
to yesterday
What more could yourlove
do for me
When will love
Be through with me
Why live life
From dream to dream
And dread the day
When dreaming
Ends
How wonderful life is
Now you're
In the world
One day I'll fly away
Leave all this
to yesterday
Why live life
From dream to dream
And dread the day
When dreaming
-  Ends
-
One day
I'll fly away
Fly
Fly
Away
- Sorry!
-
- I didn't mean to--
I saw-- I saw
your light on, and...
- I climbed up the--
- What?
I couldn't sleep, and I wanted to
thank you for helping me get the job.
Oh. Ofcourse.
Yes, Toulouse--
Toulouse was right.
You're--
- You're very talented.
- Oh.
It's going to be
a wonderful show.
Anyway, I-I'd better go
because we, uh--
we both have
a big day tomorrow.
Wait. No, please, wait.
Before, when we were--
when we were--
when you thought
I was the Duke,
you said that you loved me,
a-and I wondered if--
- I fit was just an act?
- Yes.
- Ofcourse.
- Oh.
It just felt real.
Christian,
I'm a courtesan.
I'm paid to make men believe
what they want to believe.
Yes.
Silly of me, to think y-you could
fall in love with someone like me.
- I can't fall in love with anyone.
- Can't fall in love?
But a life with out love,
that's terrible.
No, being on the street,
that's terrible.
- No, love is like oxygen.
- What?
- A girl has got to eat.
- All you need is love
- She'll end up on the street.
- All you need is love
Love is just a game
I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
The only way
of loving me, baby
Is to pay a lovely fee
Just one night
Give me just one night
There's no way
'cause you can't pay
-  In the name oflove
-
One night
in the name oflove
You crazy fool
I won't give in to you
Don't--
Leave me this way
I can't survive
with out your sweet love
Oh, baby
Don't leave me this way
You'd think that people
would have had enough
Of silly love songs
I look around me
and I see
It isn't so
Oh, no.
Some people want to
fill the world
With silly love songs
Well, what's wrong
with that
I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again
Oh, no!
Love lifts us up
where we belong
- Get down! Get down!
- Where eagles fly
On a mountain high
Love makes us act
like we are fools
Throw our lives away
For one happy day
We could be heroes
Just for one day
You
You will be mean
No, I won't.
And I
I'll drink all the time.
We should be lovers
We can't do that
We should be lovers
And that's a fact
Though nothing
Will keep us together
We could steal time
Just for one day
We could be heroes
Forever and ever
We could be heroes
Forever and ever
We could be heroes
Just because
I
Will always love you
I
Can't help loving
You
How wonderful
life is
Now you're in
The world
You're gonna be bad for business.
I can tell.
How wonderful
Life is
Now you're in
The world
How wonderful
life was, now Satine was in the world.
But in the Duke,
Zidler had gotten much more
than he had bargained for.
The conversion ofthe
Moulin Rouge into a theater will
cost a fantastic sum of money.
So in return,
I would require a contract...
that, um, uh,
binds Satine to me...
exclusively.
Naturally, I shall require
some security.
I shall require the deeds
to the Moulin Rouge.
My dear Duke, I--
Please! Don't think
that I'm naive, Zidler.
I shall hold the deeds
to the Moulin Rouge.
- And if there are any she nanigans,
- I--
my manservant Warner...
will deal with it
in the only language...
that you underworld
show folk understand.
Satine will be mine.
It's not that I'm
a jealous man.
I just don't like...
other people
touching my things!
I... understand...
completely, Duke.
Good. Now that we have
an understanding,
it would appear that, uh,
you have the means...
to transform
your beloved Moulin Rouge--
Into a theater!
I shall woo Satine
over supper tonight.
We will have created...
the world's first
completely modern,
entirely electric,
totally bohemian,
all-singing, all-dancing...
stage spectacular!
The show must go on!
Yes, the show would go on,
but Satine would not attend the supper
that night or the following night.
You have betrayed me!
Mad with jealousy, the evil maharajah
forces the courtesan...
to make the penniless sitarplayer
believe she doesn't love him.
Oh, yes! Ofcourse!
''Thank you for curing me of
my ridiculous obsession with love,''
says the penniless sitarplayer,
throwing money at her feet
and leaving the kingdom forever.
- No! No!
- No!
-
-Brilliant!Brilliant!
Oh, but a life without love,
that's terrible.
- Yes, but the sitar player...
- Wait, wait, wait!
with the magical sitar--
That's my part, Christian!
Th-That's my part!
- Don't you dare. No.
-
His magic sitar, who can
only speak the truth, says--
''The greatest thing
you'll ever learn is just to love...
and be loved in return. ''
-
- A picnic, sweet lady?
Oh, well, we have so much to do,
so much work.
Well, if the young writer
can carry a blanket and basket,
I don't why see why you both
can't do it in my presence.
- So the magical sitar player
falls from the roof--
- Yes, I know. Don't tell me.
The greatest thing
you'll ever--
-
- Still at it, my sweet?
- Master...
- Alley-oop!
make... contract.
Oh, my dear, sweet Duke.
So many lines to learn.
Been trilling them
over and over.
For try as the Duke may,
it was almost too easy for
the young writer and the lead actress...
to invent perfectly legitimate reasons
to avoid him.
Mademoiselle Satine, I haven't quite
finished writing that new scene.
The ''Will the Lovers Be Meeting at
the Sitar Player's Humble Abode'' scene.
I wondered if I could work on it
with you later tonight.
But, my dear, I've arranged
a magnificent supper for us
in the gothic tower.
It's not important.
We could work on it tomorrow.
Oh, how dare you!
It cannot wait until tomorrow.
The ''Lovers Will Be Meeting in the
SitarPlayer's HumbleAbode''scene...
is the most important
in the production.
We will work on it tonight
until I am completely satisfied.
- B-B-But, my dear--
- Dear Duke, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Nice work!Splendid!
Bright and early tomorrow morning,
we begin on act two--
the lovers are discovered.
- Zidler.
- My dear Duke.
Everything is arranged for that special
supper in the gothic tower tonight.
You might as well eat it yourself,
Zidler. Her affections are waning.
- Impossible.
- I understand how important
her work is to her,
but she's always at it
with that damned writer!
If I don't see her tonight,
I'm ballywell leaving!
No, dear Duke!
I'll insist Satine takes the night off.
All right. All right.
-
- You will come? Tonight?
Yes.
-  What time?
- 8:00.
- Promise?
- Yes.
Go!
-
- Are you mad?
The Duke holds the deeds
to the Moulin Rouge.
He's spending
a fortune on you.
He's given you a beautiful new dressing
room. He wants to make you a star.
- And you're dallying with the writer.
- Oh!
Harold, don't be ridicu--
I sawyou together!
It's nothing.
It's just an infatuation.
It's-- It's nothing.
The ''infatuation'' will end.
Go to the boy.
Tell him it's over.
The Duke is expecting you
in the tower at 8:00.
If I should die
This very moment
I wouldn't fear
For I've never known
Completeness
Like being here
Wrapped in
the warmth of you
Loving
Every breath of you
Why live life
From dream
To dream
And dread the day
-How  could I know,
-
-in those last, fatal days,
-
that a force
darker than jealousy...
and stronger than love...
had begun to take hold
of Satine.
Where is she?
-Do you think she'll
be up and about by tonight?
- Tomorrow morning.
Confessing? What kind of imbecile
do you take me for, Zidler?
She suddenly had
a terrible desire...
to go to a priest and--
and confess her sins.
- What?
- She wanted to be cleansed
ofher former life.
She looked upon tonight
as her wedding night.
She looked upon tonight
as her wedding night.
- Her wedding night?
- She's like a blushing bride.
She says you make her
feel like a...
virgin.
Virgin?
You know. Touched...
for the very first time.
The first--
She says it feels
so good inside...
when you hold her...
and you touch her.
Like a virgin.
She's made it through the wilderness
somehow. She's made it through.
She didn't know
how lost she was--
Until she found you
She was beat, incomplete
She had been had
She was sad and blue
But you made her feel
Yes, you ma-a-a-de her feel
Shiny and new, ohhh
Like a virgin
Touched for
the very first time
Like a vir-ir-ir-irgin
Your hearts beat
close in time
- Gonna give you all her love
- Give you all her love
-  Her fear is fading fast
-  Her fear is gone
-  She's saving it all for you
-  For you
-  Only love can last
-  Love, love, love, love
-  She's so fine and she's thine
- And she's thine
-  She'll be yours
-  She'll be yours
Till the end of time
'Cause you made her feel
Yes, you ma-a-a-a-ade
her feel
She has nothing to hide
-  Like a virgin
- Like a virgin
- Touched for the very first time
- Aaaaaah!
- Touched for the very first
ti-i-i-i-ime
-  Like a vir-ir-ir-irgin
- When your hearts beat both in time
- Oooh!
-  Like a virgin
-  Ooh-oooh
-  Feels so good inside
when you hold her
-  Feels so good inside
And you touch her
Ohh!
- Ohhh!
- A-Aaah!
Ohh-ohhh!
She's so fine
and she's mine
Makes me strong
Yes, she makes me bold
Now, her love thawed out
Yes, her lo-o-o-o-ove
thawed out
What was scared and cold
- Like a virgin!
-   Ooh, like a virgin
Touched for
the very first time
Like a vir-ir-ir-irgin
When your hearts beat
both in time
- Like a virgin!
-  Vir-Vir-Virgin
Feels so good inside
-  Feels so good inside
-Like a virgin, when you touch her
When you hold her
and you touch her
- Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
- Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
- Ahhhhhh
- Ahhhhhh
Like a virgin
La la la
La-la la-la
La la la
La-la la-la-la
Harold Zidler's brilliant
lies had once again averted disaster.
But no lie,
however brilliant,
could save Satine.
Monsieur Zidler,
Mademoiselle Satineis dying.
She has consumption.
My little sparrow is dying?
She mustn't know, Marie.
The show must go on.
Allnight
the penniless sitarplayer had waited,
and now,
forthe first time,
he felt the cold stab
of jealousy.
Where were you last night?
I told you.
I was sick.
You don't have to
lie to me.
We have to end it.
Everyone knows.
Harold knows.
Sooner or later
the Duke will find out too.
On opening night,
I have to sleep with the Duke.
And the jealousy
will drive you mad.
-  Christian.
- Then I'll write a song.
We'll put it in the show, and no matter
how bad things get or whatever happens,
whenever you hear it or when you sing it
or whistle it or hum it,
then you'll know it'll mean
that we love one another.
- I won't get jealous.
- Things don't work that way, Christian.
We have to end it.
We have to end it.
Never knew
I could feel like this
Like I've never
seen the sky
Before
Want to vanish
Inside your kiss
Now, uh, this new scene
is the scene where the sitar player...
writes a secret song
for the courtesan...
so that whatever is happening,
however bad things are,
th-they remember their love,
and, um--
We could take it
from your line, Satine.
So let's take it--
-  We must be careful.
- Fear not.
We will conduct our love affair
right under the maharajah.
Seasons may change
Winter to spring
Honestly, amigo,
this is impossible!
But I love you
Until the end
Of time
Come what may
Come what may
I will love you
Until my dying
Day
Suddenly the world
Seems such
a perfect place
- My dear! A little frog!
-
Suddenly it moves
With such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life
doesn't seem
Such a waste
It all revolves
Around you
And there's no mountain too high
No river too wide
Sing out this song
And I'll be there
by your side
Storm clouds may gather
And stars may collide
-  But I love you
-  I love you
-  Until the end
-  Until the end
Of time
Come what may
Come what may
I will love
You
The magical sitar player
falls from the roof and says,
''The greatest thing
you'll ever learn...
is just to love
and be loved in return.''
This ending's silly.
Why would the courtesan
go for the penniless writer?
Whoops!
I mean sitar player.
Come what may
Come
Come what may
- Yes, I will love you
-
Come what may
For I will love you
Until my dying
Day
I don't like this ending.
Don't like the ending,
my dear Duke?
Why would the courtesan choose
a penniless sitarplayer...
over the maharajah,
who is offering
a lifetime of security?
That's real love.
Once the sitarplayer
has satisfied his lust,
he will leave the courtesan
with nothing.
I suggest that in the end
the courtesan choose the maharajah.
B-But, sorry--
Sorry, but that ending
does not uphold the bohemian
ideals of truth, beauty, freedom--
I don't care about
your ridiculous dogma!
Why shouldn't the courtesan
choose the maharajah?
Because she doesn't love you!
H-Him.
H-Him. Sh-She doesn't love h--
She doesn't love him.
Oh, I see.
Monsieur Zidler,
this ending will be rewritten...
with the courtesan
choosing the maharajah...
and without
the lovers' secret song.
It will be rehearsed
in the morning,
ready for the opening
tomorrow night.
M-My dear Duke,
th-that'll be quite impossible.
Harold! Oh!
The poor Duke is
being treated appallingly.
These silly writers let their
imaginations run away with them.
Now, why don't you and I...
have a little supper,
and then afterwards...
we canlet
Monsieur Zidler know...
how we would prefer
the story to end.
Hmm?
Thank you, Elizabeth.
I don't want you
to sleep with him.
He could destroy everything.
It's for us.
You promised.
You promised to me you wouldn't
be jealous.
It will be all right.
Yes, it will.
- He's waiting.
- No. No.
Come
What may
Come what may.
She had gone
to the tower to save us all,
and for our part...
we could do nothing
but wait.
My dear Duke, I hope
I have not kept you waiting.
-
-
Don't worry, Shakespeare.
You'll get your ending
once the Duke gets his...
end in.
- Hey, hey! Nini! No!
- You keep your hands off me!
Never fall in love with a woman
who sells herself.
It always ends bad!
The boy has a ridiculous
obsession with me.
I mean, I indulge his fantasy
because he's talented.
We need him,
but only until
tomorrow night.
We have a dance...
in the brothels
of Buenos Aires.
It tells the story...
- of a prostitute...
-
and a man...
who falls in love...
with her.
First there is desire.
Then passion.
Then suspicion.
Jealousy! Anger!
Betrayal!
Where love is for the highest bidder,
there can be no trust.
Without trust,
there is no love!
Jealousy.
Yes,jealousy...
will drive you mad!
Roxanne
You don't have to
put on that red light
Walk the streets
for money
You don't care if it's wrong
or if it is right
Roxanne
You don't have to
wear that dress tonight
Roxanne
You don't have to
sell your body to the night
His eyes upon your face
-His hand
-
Upon your hand
His lips
Caress your skin
It's more than I can stand
Oh
-Roxanne
- Why does
My heart cry
Roxanne
Feelings I can't fight
-
- You're free
To leave me
But just don't
deceive me
And please
Believe me when I say
I love you
When this production succeeds,
you will no longer
be a cancan dancer,
but an actress.
I will make you...
a star.
Accept it...
as a gift
from this maharajah...
to his courtesan.
Oh, and--
and the ending?
Let Zidler keep...
his fairy tale ending.
-  Roxanne
- Why
-  Does my heart cry
- You don't have to
put on that red light
-Roxanne
-Feelings
-  I can't fight
- You don't have to
do your hair tonight
-Roxanne
- You're free
To leave me
But just don't
deceive me
And please
Believe me when I say
I love you
Come what
May
I will love you
Till my dying
Day
No.
No?
Oh, I see.
It's our very own
penniless sitar player.
My dear Duke--
Silence!
-
-
You made me believe
that you loved me.
No.
-  Roxanne
- Why
-Does my heart
- No!
Cry
Feelings
I can't hide
-
- Why
Does my heart cry
-  Roxanne
-Feelings
- You don't have to
wear that dress tonight
-I can't fight
Why
Does my heart
Cry
Roxanne
Feelings
I can't
Hide
Roxanne
-
-
I couldn't.
I couldn't.
-
- I couldn't go through with it.
I saw you there and I--
I felt differently,
and I couldn't pretend.
And the Duke, he saw.
He saw, and he--
Christian, I love you.
It's okay.
I couldn't deal with it.
I didn't want to pretend anymore.
I didn't want to lie.
I don't--
And he knows.
- He knows, and he saw you.
- That's all right.
You don't have to pretend anymore.
We'll leave.
We'll leave tonight.
Leave? Wh--
Wh-- The show? Wh--
I don't care.
I don't care about the show.
We have each other,
and that's all that matters.
Yes.
As long as
we have each other.
- Wehave each other.
- Chocolat.
Take Miss Satine to her dressing room
and get the things she needs.
- Noone must see you.
Do you understand?
- I understand.
- Darling, you go and pack,
and I'll be waiting.
-
It's the boy. He--
He has bewitched her with words.
I want her back, Zidler.
Find her--
Tell her...
that the show
will end my way...
and she will come to me
when the curtain falls,
or I'll have the boy killed.
Killed?
Killed.
Forgive the intrusion,
cherub.
You're wasting your time,
Harold.
Stop it.
You don't understand.
The Duke
is going to kill Christian.
No.
The Duke
is insanely jealous.
Unless you do his ending
and sleep with him tomorrow night,
the Duke
will have Christian killed.
He can't scare us.
He's a powerful man.
You know he can do it.
-
- What are you doing?
I don't need you anymore!
All my life you've made me
believe I was only worth
what someone would pay for me!
But Christian loves me.
He loves me, Harold.
He loves me,
and that is
worth everything.
We're going away
from you,
away from the Duke,
away from the Moulin Rouge!
Good-bye, Harold.
You're dying, Satine.
You're dying.
Another trick, Harold?
No, my love.
The doctor told us.
Marie?
I'm dying.
I was a fool
To
Believe
A fool
To
Believe
It all ends
Today
Yes, it all
Ends
Today
Send Christian away.
Only you can save him.
He'll fight for me.
Yes, unless he believes
you don't love him.
What?
You're a great actress,
Satine.
Make him believe
you don't love him.
No.
Use your talent
to save him.
Hurt him.
Hurt him to save him.
There is no other way.
The show must go on,
Satine.
We're creatures
of the underworld.
We can't afford to love.
Today's
The day
When dreaming
Ends
Another hero,
another mindless crime...
behind the curtain...
in the pantomime.
On and on
Does anybody know
what we are living for
What ever happened
We leave it all
to chance
Another heartache
Another failed romance
On and on
Does anybody know
What we are living for
The show must go on
The show must go on
Outside
the dawn is breaking
On the stage
That holds
our final destiny
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside
my heart is breaking
My makeup
May be flaking
But my smile
Still stays on
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll top the bill
I'll earn the kill
I have to find the will
to carry on
On with the
On with the
On with the
Show
On with the show!
On with the show!
The show
-Must go on
- The show
Must go
On
What's wrong?
I'm staying with the Duke.
After I left you,
the Duke came to see me...
and he offered me
everything.
Everything that I've
ever dreamed of.
He has one condition.
I must never see you again.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?
- You knew who I was.
- What about last night, what we said?
I don't expect you
to understand.
The difference between you and I is
that you can leave any time you choose.
But this is my home.
- The Moulin Rouge is my home.
- No.
There must be something else.
This can't be real.
There's something the matter. Tell me
what it is. Tell me what's wrong!
- Tell me the truth! Tell me the truth!
-
The truth?
The truth is,
I am the Hindu courtesan...
and I choose the maharajah.
That's how the story
really ends.
Jealousy has driven him mad!
Satine!
Satine!
Satine!
Things aren't always
as they seem.
Things are exactly
the way they seem.
Christian, you may see me only as
a drunken, vice-ridden gnome...
whose friends are just pimps
and girls from the brothels,
but I know
about art and love...
if only because I long for it
with every fiber of my being.
She loves you. I know it.
I know she loves you.
Go away, Toulouse.
Leave me alone.
Go away.
Go away!
I wanted to shut out
what Toulouse had said,
but he had filled me
with doubt.
And there was only one way
to be sure.
I had to know.
So I returned...
to the Moulin Rouge...
one...
last...
time.
time.
She's mine!
I only speak the truth
I only speak the truth
I only speak the truth
I only speak the truth
I only speak the truth!

I know she still loves him.
There's got to be a reason.
How about one of them

Then you agree something is wrong.
But what? But what?
I raise high
my ceremonial wedding sword...
and welcome my loyal subjects
to join with us...
in celebration...

- of our sacred--
What a magnificent
performance.
A little bit more for me.
Come on, lovey. That's a girl.
The boy's here.
I told Satine that if Christian were
to come near her, he would be killed!
He very soon will be.
-
- He will be killed.
That's it. That's why she's
pushing him away-- to save him.
That's it, that's it.
Christian!
No! Aah!
Aaah! God!
Oh, God, this is high up!
- I've come to pay my bill.
-
You shouldn't be here,
Christian.
Just leave.
Killed. Killed?
Killed!
-
- I must warn him!
-
- You made me believe that you loved me.
Why shouldn't I pay you?
- Please, Christian.
-
She's got to get on the stage!
Jealousy has driven
the sitarplayer into hiding!
- You did your job so very well.
- Persian army, go!
The boy's taken Satine.
Quick.
Why can't I pay you
like everyone else does?
Don't, Christian.
There's no point.Just leave.
-
- They'll kill him! The poor boy!
But I have found them!
- Stop him, stop him, stop him!
-
-
-Get up, boy!
Go!
- If it wasn't real,
then why can't I pay you?
- Let the palace doors be opened.
Christian! Christian!
Open the doors!
Let me pay!
Let me pay!
- Open the doors!
- Tell me it wasn't real!
- Tell me you don't love me!
- Open the doors!
- Tell me you don't love me!
- Christian!
Tell me you don't love me!
What's going on?
Ha ha ha!
I am not fooled!
Though he has shaved off his beard
and adopts a disguise,
mine eyes do not lie.
For it is he,
the same
penniless sitar player!
-
- Driven mad by jealousy!
Oh, Lord. No!
-
-
This woman is yours now.
- I've paid my whore.
-
I owe you nothing.
And you are nothing to me.
Thank you for curing me ofmy
ridiculous obsession with love.
I can't remember my line.
This sitar player...
doesn't love you.
See, he flees the kingdom!
Pumpkin, it's for the best.
You know it is.
The show must go on.
And now, my bride,
it is time foryou to raise
your voice to the heavens...
and say your wedding vows.
-Sing to our gods your--
- I've got it. I've got it! Christian!

-
The greatest thing
you'll ever learn...
is just to love
and be loved...
in return!

- Guards, seize them!
- He's a mad man!
Vive la vie de boheme!

Are you all right?

You've got to go on,

Can't go on without you,
though.
You've got
so much to give.
Tell--
Tell our story, Christian.
No.
Yes.
Promise me.
Promise me.
Yes.
Yes.
That way I'll--
I'll always be with you.
There was
A boy
A very strange
Enchanted
Boy
Days turned into weeks.
Weeks turned into months.
And then one
not so very special day,
I went to my typewriter,
I sat down...
and I wrote our story.
A story about a time,
a story about a place,
a story about the people.
But above all things,
a story about love.
A love...
that will live...
forever.
The...
end.
The greatest thing
You'll ever learn
Is just to love
And be loved
In return
