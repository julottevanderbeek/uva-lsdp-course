For Nick ...
I need you to town ...
Ituango.
We're right here.
Fifteen Tomas, you're on here.
And right here is the people. Ituango.
When you get to the Main Plaza,
park opposite the church.
A local farmer will go through you.
Be your guide.
It will ask what is the number?
And you say "seventy-two".
- Seventy-two.
- Yes.
- Do not forget this number.
- Okay.
Then it will take you to the cave ...
and you shall put all
inside. In that cave.
Once all this insurance.
The peasant fly entry.
When the sealed cave,
You can return to the mountain.
Now ...
When you see the people of Ituango ...
and you know you can
return by yourself,
will stop the car ...
And say to the farmer who
Have a problem with a wheel.
Ask him to exit the car,
and then you walk up to him ...
and you shoot in
head with this ...
Is a 9 mm.
It is loaded right?
Insurance is placed ...
Uninsured ... With insurance ...
Now, let me put this
here right under your thigh.
You get to always take it.
Then you drive up to the main square.
Opposite the church, there is a restaurant.
Inside the restaurant, there is a phone.
I want you to call me ...
this number.
And you confirm that everything went well.
Now ...
When you fire the peasant,
be sure to put the ...
gun very close to
his head, okay?
Now, Nick, listen.
It will be easy to kill ...
if you know nothing about it.
So do not make conversation.
Are you okay?

We are all making sacrifices Nico,
and I am very proud of you.
You're like a son to me.
It will end soon.

Are not you happy with me?
Would I want to leave?
No, Mary ...
I can not imagine a life without you.
So what happens?
Everyone here loves you.
You're part of my family.
Nico, come and stand next to your fiancee.
The Minister of Justice
wants to take the pattern ...
to a prison in the United States.
As you can see, move to
all outside the hacienda.
Yes.
For long.
You and Mary can
stay with your brother.
Until we find
place in Medellin.
Drago will show you how to use all
what's inside this bag.
OK.
Nick ...
What's this?
It is for self-defense, Dylan.
Are you kidding?
I do not want a gun in my house.
What's up?
Is it money? Is that it?
Is it worth it to be like them?
I'm not like them.
I break my heart man.
Anne knows I do not want any of this.
Then you invent something,
pack your bags.
And you go.
Do not make a scene.
Guys?
Guys, come to the radio.
They killed the Minister of Justice.
They say it was Pablo.
They say he stated
war on the government.
This is your room.
Linda.
This is the kitchen.
And this is the room
Pablo and Pablo bath.
And this is the money of Pablo.
Do not touch it.
Needs to move these days.
But do not worry, this
war will end soon.

Hi Nico, I only see the
game and then I'll go.
Drink a beer.

How does it feel Mary?
She is fine.
Is it only right?
Yes. All right.
Maybe pregnant.
No, definitely not.
What do you expect, Nico?
Attacks, attacks Nico, attacks ...
I'm working on it.
He's working on it.
It should not be working, Nick ...

Your brother has a son, okay?
If, and are expecting another.
You can do it.
In fact think of returning to Canada.
She misses her home
and want to return there.
I wanted to ask ...
but I think it would be good for
Maria and my back also ...
at least for a while until
everything gets cold around here.
That's not a good idea Nico, not now.
Did Mary know that?
Yes, we talked about it.
Why do you want to return your brother?
Have you had problems at the beach?
No, that was over, thank God.
Thank God?
How to "thank God"?
It's nothing, it's figuratively.
OK ...
Because God had nothing to do,
Nick was you, was your
intervention that killed those people.
You're as guilty as I am.
Ve ...
Sorry.
¿Dylan?

almost impossible to escape.
