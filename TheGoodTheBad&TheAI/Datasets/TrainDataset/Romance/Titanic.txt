All of Philadelphia society
will be there
and all the while
I feel I'm...
standing in the middle
of a crowded room
screaming at the top of my lungs
and no one even looks up.
Do you love him?
- Pardon me?
- Do you love him?
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.
Well ,  it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?
This is not
a suitable conversation.
-Why can't you just answer the question?
-
This is absurd. You don't know me ,
and I don't know you
and we are not having
this conversation at all.
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous and I am leaving now.
Jack. Mr. Dawson ,
it's been a pleasure.
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you...
- And you've insulted me.
- Well ,  you deserved it.
- Right.
- Right.
- I thought you were leaving.
- I am.
You are so annoying.
-
- Wait.
I don't have to leave.
This is my part of the ship. You leave.
Oh-ho-ho ,
well ,  well ,  well.
Now who's being rude?
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?
So what are you ,
an artist or something?
Well ,  these are rather good.
They're ,  uh--
They're very good actually.
Jack ,  this is exquisite work.
They didn't think too much
of them in old Paree.
Paris! You do get around
for a poor--
Well ,  uh ,  uh ,  a person
of limited means.
Go on ,  a poor guy ,
you can say it.
Well ,  well ,  well.
And these were drawn from life?
Well ,  that's one
of the good things about Paris--
Lots of girls willing
to take their clothes off.
You liked this woman.
You used her several times.
Well ,  she had beautiful hands ,
you see?
I think you must have had
a love affair with her.
No ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no.
Just with her hands.
She was a one-legged prostitute.
See?
- : Oh!
-
Ah ,  she had a good sense
of humor ,  though.
Oh ,  and this lady...
she used to sit
at this bar every night
wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned
just waiting
for her long-lost love.
Called her Madame Bijou.
See how her clothes
are all moth-eaten?
Well ,  you have a gift ,  Jack.
You do. You see people.
I see you.
And?
You wouldn't have jumped.
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.
Rose has already done that.
Look ,  here comes
that vulgar Brown woman.
Quickly ,  get up
before she sits with us.
Hello ,  girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.
We're awfully sorry
you missed it.
The countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.
Molly:
Countess.
So you've not yet
lit the last four boilers?
No ,  I don't see the need.
We are making excellent time.
The press knows
the size of Titanic.
Now I want them to marvel
at her speed.
We must give them
something new to print.
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.
Mr. Ismay ,  I would prefer
not to push the engines
until they've been
properly run in.
Of course
I'm just a passenger.
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.
Retire with a bang ,  eh ,  E.J.?
Good man.
Well ,  after that I worked on
a squid boat in Monterey.
Then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica
and started doing portraits there
for ten cents a piece.
Why can't I be like you ,  Jack--
just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it?
Say we'll go there
sometime to that pier
even if we only
ever just talk about it.
No ,  we'll do it.
We'll drink cheap beer. We'll ride
on the roller coaster till we throw up.
Then we'll ride horses on the beach
right in the surf.
But you'll have to do it like a real
cowboy. None of that sidesaddle stuff.
- You mean ,  one leg on each side?
- Yeah.
- Can you show me?
- Sure... if you like.
- Teach me to ride like a man.
- And chew tobacco like a man.
And spit like a man.
They didn't teach you that
in finishing school?
- No.
- Well ,  come on ,  I'll show you.
Let's do it.
I'll show you how. Come on.
Jack ,  no! Jack ,  no!
Wait ,  Jack. No ,  Jack.
I couldn't possibly ,  Jack.
Watch closely.
- That's disgusting!
- All right ,  your turn.
That was pitiful!
Come on ,  you really got
to hawk it back ,  you know?
Get some leverage to it.
Use your arms ,  arc your neck.
- See the range on that thing?
- Mm-hmm.
-
-Jack: Okay ,  go.
-That was better. You got to work on it.
-Really?
Really try and hawk it up
and get some body to it ,  you know?
You got to...
Mother.
May I introduce Jack Dawson?
Charmed ,  I'm sure.
The others were gracious
and curious
about the man
who had saved my life
but m ymother looked at him
like an insect--
a dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.
Well ,  Jack ,  sounds like you're a good
man to have around in a sticky spot.
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?
-
- Shall we go to dress ,  Mother?
See you at dinner ,  Jack.
Uh ,  son? Son!
Do you have the slightest comprehension
what you're doing?
Not really.
Well ,  you're about to go
into the snake pit.
What are you planning to wear?
I figured. Come on.
I was right.
You and my son
are just about the same size.
-
- You shine up like a new penny.
Good evening ,  sir.
Good evening.
Man:
Hello.
Cal: Do you know that there are
several thousand tons
of Hockley steel
in this very ship?
- Ruth: Hmm. Which part?
- Cal: All the right ones ,  of course.
Then we'll know who to hold
accountable if there's a problem.
- Where's my daughter?
- Oh ,  she'll be along.
- There is the countess.
- Hello ,  my dear.
- Good evening ,  Cal.
- Cal: So good to see you.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.
Ruth:
I'll see you at dinner.
Darling? Surely
you remember Mr. Dawson.
Dawson?
Well ,  it's amazing.
You could almost pass for a gentleman.
- Almost.
- Extraordinary.
Ruth:
My dear ,  it's delightful to see you.
What a remarkable
voyage this is.
- It's mad ,  isn't it?
- Ruth: I love your perfume.
There's the Countess of Rothes.
And ,  um ,  that's John Jacob Astor--
the richest man on the ship.
His little wife there ,  Madeleine ,
is my age and in delicate condition.
See how she's
trying to hide it?
- Quite the scandal.
- Hmm.
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress Madame Aubert.
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children ,  of course.
And over here we have
Sir Cosmo and Lucille Lady Duff-Gordon.
She designs naughty lingerie ,
among her many talents.
Very popular with the royals.
Congratulations ,  Hockley.
She's splendid.
Why ,  thank you.
- Care to escort a lady to dinner?
- Certainly.
-
- Sweat pea?
- Cal: Sweet pea.
- Ain't nothin' to it ,  is there ,  Jack?
Remember ,  they love money ,  so just
pretend like you own a gold mine...
and you're in the club.
- Hey ,  Astor!
- Well ,  hello ,  Molly. Nice to see you.
J.J. Madeleine ,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.
- How Do you do?
- Pleasure.
Hello ,  Jack.
Are you of the Boston Dawsons?
No-- the Chippewa Falls Dawsons ,
actually.
Oh ,  yes. Yes.
He must have been nervous ,
but he never faltered.
They assumed
he was one of them--
Heir to a rail road fortune ,
perhaps.
New money ,  obviously ,
but still a member of the club.
Mother ,  of course ,
could always be counted upon.
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage ,  Mr. Dawson.
I hear they're quite good
on this ship.
The best I've seen ,  ma'am.
Hardly any rats.
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition off art.
Not to impugn your work ,  sir.
Ismay:
She may be mine on paper
but in the eyes of God ,
she belongs to Thomas Andrews.
:
Are these all for me?
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.
He knows every rivet
in her ,  don't you ,  Thomas?
- Your ship is a wonder ,  truly.
- Thank you ,  Rose.
- And how Do you take your caviar ,  sir?
- No caviar for me ,  thanks.
Never did like it much.
And where ,  exactly ,
Do you live ,  Mr. Dawson?
Well ,  right now ,  my address
is the R.M.S. Titanic.
After that ,
I'm on God's good humor.
And how is it
you have means to travel?
I work my way
from place to place--
You know ,
tramp steamers and such.
But I won my ticket
on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.
A very lucky hand.
- All life is a game of luck.
- Mmm.
A real man makes
his own luck ,  Archie.
- Right ,  Dawson?
- Mmm.
And you find that sort of
rootless existence appealing ,  Do you?
Well ,  yes ,  ma'am ,  I do.
I mean ,  got everything I need
right here with me.
Got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.
I mean ,  I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's going to happen
or who I'm going to meet ,
where I'm going to wind up.
Just the other night ,  I was sleeping
under a bridge ,  and now here I am
on the grandest ship in the world
having champagne with you fine people.
-
- I'll take some more of that.
I figure life's a gift ,
and I don't intend on wasting it.
You never know what hand
you're going to get dealt next.
You learn to take life
as it comes at you. Here you go ,  Cal.
To make each day count.
- Well said ,  Jack.
- Hear ,  hear!
To making it count.
- All: To making it count.
- Archie: Bravo.
Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.
So he comes home drunk as a pig ,
celebrating and he lights a fire.
: Next it'll be
brandies in the smoking room.
Archie:
Well ,  join me in a brandy ,  gentlemen?
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke
and congratulate each other
on being masters of the universe.
Ladies ,  thank you for
the pleasure of your company.
Rose ,  may I escort you
back to the cabin?
- No ,  I'll stay here.
- Here you go ,  Molly.
Archie:
Joining us ,  Dawson?
You don't want to stay out here
with the women ,  Do you?
No ,  thanks.
I've got to be heading back.
- Ah.
- Probably best.
It'll be all business
and politics ,  that sort of thing--
Wouldn't interest you.
But Dawson ,  good of you to come.
Jack ,  must you go?
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.
Good night ,  Rose.
So you want to go
to a real party?
-
-
Is okay I put my hand here? Okay.
- Tal la frikken svenska?
- What?
I can't understand you.
Hey! Bravo ,  bravo!
- Thank you. Come on ,  guys.
- Let's go!
I'm going to dance
with her now ,  all right?
- Come on.
- What?
- Come with me.
- What? Jack--Jack ,  wait!
-
- I can't do this.
We're going to have to
get a little bit closer.
Like this.
-
- You're still my best girl ,  Cora.
- I don't know the steps.
- Neither do l.
Just go with it.
Don't think.
-
- Hey.
Wait ,  Jack ,  Jack!
Wait! Stop ,  Jack!
- Ba-ba-ba.
-
- Rose: Wait!
- Hey! Hey!
-Jack: Yeah!
-Jack ,  no!
Whaaa!
...jurisdiction of the Sherman Act
so my lawyers will argue.
That's what Rockefeller said ,  but
the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.
What? You think
a first-class girl can't drink?
-
- Get out of here.
- You all right?
-
- I'm fine.
-
Two out of three ,
two out of three.
So...
you think you're
big ,  tough men?
Let's see you do this.
Hold this for me ,  Jack.
Hold it up.
Ow!
-Jesus ,  Mary and Joseph!
- You all right?
I haven't done that in years.
Go see Maggie ,  lads.
Give her the holley! Let's go!
Musicians:
Ho!
Coffee ,  sir?
I had hoped you would
come to me last night.
I was tired.
Your exertions below decks
were no doubt exhausting.
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.
You will never behave like that
again ,  Rose. Do you understand?
I'm not a foreman in one
of your mills that you can command.
I'm your fiancée.
My fiancée?
My fiancée?!!
Yes ,  you are ,  and my wife!
My wife in practice if not yet by law ,
so you will honor me.
You will honor me the way a wife
is required to honor a husband.
Because I will not be
made out a fool ,  Rose.
Is this in anyway unclear?
- No.
- Good.
Excuse me.
Miss Rose!
- We had a little... accident.
- That's all right ,  Miss Rose.
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry ,  Trudy.
Let me help you.
It's all right ,  miss.
It's all right ,  miss.
- Tea ,  Trudy.
- Yes ,  ma'am.
You're not to see that boy again ,
Do you understand me?
- Rose ,  I forbid it.
- Oh ,  stop it ,  Mother.
You'll give yourself
a nosebleed.
This is not a game.
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.
Of course I know it's gone.
You remind me every day.
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.
That name is the only card
we have to play.
I don't understand you.
It is a fine match with Hockley.
- It will ensure our survival.
- How can you put this on my shoulders?
- Why are you being so selfish?
- I'm being selfish?
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?
Is that what you want?
To see our fine things
sold at auction?
Our memories
scattered to the winds?
It's so unfair.
Of course it's unfair.
We're women.
Our choices are never easy.
Hmm?
Congregation:
** Protect them by Thy guardian hand **
** From every peril
on the land. **
** O spirit ,
whom the Father sent **
**To spread across
the firmament **
** O wind of heaven ,
by Thy might **
** Save all who dare
the eagle's flight **
**And keep them
by Thy watchful... **
- Hello ,  Mr. Andrews.
- Hello ,  Jack.
- Sir.
- I need to talk to somebody for a sec.
You're not supposed
to be in here.
** ...fire and foe
Protect them... **
I was just here last night.
You don't remember me?
No ,  I'm afraid I don't.
Now you're going to have to turn around.
He'll tell you.
I just-- I just need--
Mr. Hockley
and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.
They asked me to ,  uh...
give you this in gratitude.
- I don't want your money. Please ,  l--
- And also to remind you...
that you hold
a third-class ticket
and that your presence here
is no longer appropriate.
Please ,  I just want
to speak to Rose for--
Gentlemen ,  will you please see that
Mr. Dawson gets to where he belongs
and that he stays there?
Yes ,  sir.
Come along ,  you.
** Oh ,  hear us
when we cry to Thee **
** For those in peril
on the sea. **
Ruth: And why Do you have
two steering wheels?
We really only use
this near shore.
Excuse me ,  sir. Another ice warning.
This one's from the Noordam.
Thank you ,  Sparks.
Oh ,  not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.
In fact ,  we're speeding up.
I've just ordered
the last boilers lit.
Man: Okay ,  son ,
wind it up tight like I showed you.
Okay ,  now ,  let it go.
- Was good ,  wasn't it?
- Quite nice.
That's excellent ,  son.
Rose:
Mr. Andrews ,  forgive me...
I did the sum in my head
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned
forgive me ,  but it seems that there
are not enough for everyone aboard.
About half ,  actually.
Rose ,  you miss nothing ,  Do you?
In fact ,  I put in these new type davits
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one
but it was thought by some
that the deck would look too cluttered
so I was overruled.
Waste of deck space as it is
on an unsinkable ship.
Sleep soundly ,  young Rose. I have built
you a good ship ,  strong and true.
She's all the lifeboat you need.
Just keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.
Come on.
Jack ,  this is impossible.
I can't see you.
- I need to talk to you.
- No ,  Jack ,  no.
Jack ,  I'm engaged.
I'm marrying Cal.
I love Cal.
Rose ,  you're no picnic.
All right ,  you're a spoiled
little brat ,  even
but under that you're the most
amazingly astounding
wonderful girl-- woman--
that I've ever known and...
-Jack ,  l...
- No ,  let me try and get this out.
You're , you're ama--
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.
I've got ten bucks
in my pocket.
I have nothing to offer you
and I know that.
I understand.
But I'm too involved now.
You jump ,  I jump ,  remember?
I can't turn away
without knowing you'll be all right.
That's all that I want.
Well ,  I'm fine.
I'll be fine ,  really.
Really?
I don't think so.
They've got you trapped ,  Rose
and you're going to die
if you don't break free--
Maybe not right away
because you're strong ,  but
sooner or later that fire
that I love about you ,  Rose...
that fire is going to burn out.
It's not up to you
to save me , Jack.
You're right.
Only you can do that.
I'm going back.
Leave me alone.
Countess: Tell Lucille about the
disaster you had with the stationer's.
Well ,  of course ,  the invitations
had to be sent back twice.
- Oh ,  my dear!
- And the dreadful bridesmaid's gowns--
Let me tell you what an odyssey
that has been.
Rose decided
she wanted lavender.
She knows I detest the color ,
so she did it only to spite me.
Lucille:
If only you'd come to me sooner.
Ruth saw some of my designs
in "La Mode Illustree."
They were for Trousseau of the Duchess
of Malborough's youngest daughter.
Theyw ere quite charming ,  but I think
you'll agree ,  my dear ,  that together
we've created something of a phoenix
from the ashes.
Hello , Jack.
I changed my mind.
- They said you might be--
- Shh.
Give me your hand.
Now close your eyes.
Go on.
Step up.
Now hold on to the railing.
- Keep your eyes closed ,  don't peek.
- I'm not.
Step up onto the rail.
Hold on. Hold on.
Keep your eyes closed.
-
- Do you trust me?
I trust you.
All right ,  open your eyes.
I'm flying! Jack!
:
** Come , Josephine ,  my flying machine **
** Going up ,  she goes **
** Up ,  she goes... **
That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.
So we're up to dusk
the night of the sinking.
- Six hours to go.
- Incredible.
There's Smith and he's standing there
and he's got the iceberg warning...
in his fucking hand-- excuse me--
his hand ,  and he's ordering more speed.
working against him.
He figures anything big enough
to sink the ship
they're going to see
in time to turn
but the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.
Doesn't corner worth a damn.
Everything he knows is wrong.
It's quite proper ,  I assure you.
This is the sitting room.
- Will this light do?
- What?
Don't artists need good light?
:
That is true
but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.
Monet!
- Do you know his work?
- Of course.
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?
I know ,  it's extraordinary.
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.
- That's nice.
- What is it ,  a sapphire?
A diamond ,
a very rare diamond.
Jack ,  I want you to draw me like one
of your French girls... wearing this.
All right.
Wearing only this.
The last thing I need
is another picture of me
Looking like a porcelain doll.
As a paying customer...
I expect to get what I want.
Over on the bed--
the couch.
Go... Lie down.
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Put your arm back the way it was.
Right.
Put that other arm up ,
that hand right by your face there.
Right.
Now ,  head down.
Eyes to me ,
keep them on me.
And try to stay still.
So serious.
I believe you are blushing ,
Mr. Big Artiste.
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.
He does landscapes.
Just relax your face.
- Sorry.
- No laughing.
My heart was pounding
the whole time.
It was the most erotic moment
of my life.
Up until then ,  at least.
- So what happened next?
- You mean ,  did we do it?
Sorry ,  to disappoint you ,
Mr. Bodine.
Jack was very professional.
Thank you.
What you doing?
Will you put this back
in the safe for me?
Mm-hmm.
Would you excuse me?
- None of the stewards have seen her.
- This is absurd.
It's a ship ,  there's only
so many places she could be.
Lovejoy ,  find her.
- Clear.
- Yes.
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.
Like a mill pond.
Not a breath of wind.
It will make the bergs
harder to see
with no breaking water
at the base.
Hmm.
Well ,  I'm off. Maintain speed
and heading ,  Mr. Lightoller.
Yes ,  sir.
It's getting cold.
You look nice.
-
- Lovejoy: Miss Rose?
My drawings!
Come on!
- No ,  wait ,  wait!
- Wait ,  wait ,  wait!
Go ,  go! Down ,  down!
Rose:
Quickly ,  quickly!
Bye!
- Sorry!
-
- It's all right!
-
Pretty tough for a valet ,
this fellow.
- Seems more like a cop.
- I think he was.
-Jack: Oh ,  shit.
-
No ,  over here!
Quick!
- Now what?!
- What?!
Hold up! What're you two
doing down here?
You shouldn't be down here!
It could be dangerous!
Jack: Carry on! Don't mind us.
You're doing a great job!
Keep up the good work!
Ah ,  look what
we have here ,  huh?
Thank you.
-
- Where to ,  miss?
To the stars.
You nervous?
No.
Put your hands on me , Jack.
Crewman:
God ,  it's bloody cold.
You know ,  I can smell ice ,
you know ,  when it's near.
- Bollocks.
- But I can ,  all right!
Murdoch: Did you ever find
those binoculars for the lookouts?
Haven't seen them
since Southampton.
Well ,  I'll be on my rounds.
Cheerio.
You're trembling.
Don't worry.
I'll be all right.
- They ran down there.
- Right.
Lovejoy:
Anything missing?
I've got a better idea.
Gotcha!
Did you see those guys' faces?
Did you see the...
When the ship docks...
I'm getting off with you.
This is crazy.
I know.
It doesn't make any sense.
That's why I trust it.
:
Oh , yes. Here ,  look at this.
Oh ,  look at that ,  would you?
- They're a bit warmer than we are.
- Well ,  if that's what it takes
for us to get warmer I'd rather not ,
if it's all the same to you.
- Bugger me!
-
-
- Pick up , you bastards!
- Is there anyone there?
- Yes ,  what Do you see?
- Iceberg! Right ahead!
- Thank you.
Iceberg! Right ahead!
Hard to starboard!
Crewman:
Hard to starboard!
-
- Crewman: Turn ,  turn! Steady!
-
-
Full astern!
- Hard over.
- Helm's hard over ,  sir.
-
- Go ,  lads! Go!
Shut all the dampers!
Shut them!
Hold it.
Hold it!
Now ,  engage
the reversing engine!
Why aren't they turning?!
- Is it hard over?!
- Crewman: It is , yes ,  sir ,  hard over!
:
Come on ,  come on ,  come on.
Turn.
Yes.
It's going to hit!
Jesus Christ.
- :Jesus.
- Hard to port!
Crewman:
Hard to port!
