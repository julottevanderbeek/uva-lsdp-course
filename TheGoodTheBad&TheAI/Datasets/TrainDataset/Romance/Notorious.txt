Is there any legal reason why
sentence should not be pronounced?
- No, Your Honor.
- Yes. I have something to say.
You can put me away. But you can't
put away what's going to happen...
to you and to this
whole country next time.
- Next time we are going to...
- I wouldn't say anymore.
We'll leave that for the appeal.
It is the judgment of this court
that the defendant, John Huberman,
having been found guilty of the crime
of treason against the United States...
by the jury of this court for the
southern district of Florida at Miami,
be committed to the custody
of the United States attorney general...
for imprisonment in an institution
of the penitentiary type...
for a period of 20 years.
And the defendant
may be forthwith remanded...
to the custody
of the United States marshall.
- Court is now adjourned.
- Here she comes.
- Just a minute, Miss Huberman.
- Hold it, Miss Huberman.
We'd like a statement from you,
Miss Huberman, about your father.
For instance, do you think
your father got what he deserved?
Could we say you're pleased your
father is going to pay the penalty...
for being a German worker?
Let us know
if she tries to leave town.
Would you care to pause for
some refreshments, Mr. Hop... kins?
Alicia, were you really followed by
a policeman? It sounds very exciting.
- I'm going to shoot it out
with them tomorrow.
- He's had enough.
- So have you.
- Don't be silly. The important
drinking hasn't started yet.
Everybody here's
got a stuffed fish hanging on the wall.
Where'd they get it?
Never seen a fish.
How about you, handsome?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I like party crashers.
- He's not a party crasher.
I brought him.
- Oh.
-
- I wouldn't mind
being followed by a cop.
I hate low, underhanded people
like policemen pussyfooting after you.
Because I'm a marked
woman, you know.
I'm liable to blow up
the Panama Canal any minute now.
- Do you want some ice in it?
- No, thank you.
It's not becoming for a lovely girl
like you to be worried about policemen.
- You won't be tomorrow.
- Oh, really?
- We sail at 10:00.
- Really? We just sail away, huh?
Show me a fish,
and I'll show you a liar.
- What this party needs
is a little gland treatment.
- No fish.
We'd better start breaking up, Alicia.
I have to be on board at 9:00.
One week in Havana, and this whole thing
about your father will have blown over.
- Do you love me, Commodore?
- You're a very beautiful woman.
I'll have another drink
to appreciate that.
- Where are you going?
- Fishing.
- This time of night?
- How about you? Still drinking?
- What's the difference?
- You know something? I like you.
Well, I'll see you
on board, Alicia, 9:00.
Oh, l-I'll
have to think that over.
You don't have to pack.
We can pick up some things in Havana.
I think I'll have to leave him
here to dry out a little.
I'm very sorry you all have to go.
It has been a perfectly hideous party.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.
There's one more drink
left apiece.
- Shame about the ice.
- What is?
- Gone.
- Who's gone?
The ice.
Why do you like that song?
Because it's a lot of hooey.
There's nothing like a love song
to give you a good laugh.
That's right.
It's stuffy in here, isn't it?
Might be.
What about...
we have a picnic?
Outside?
It's too stuffy
in here for a picnic.
- Wanna finish that?
- Shame to leave it.
You're quite a boy.
- My car is outside.
- Naturally.
- Wanna go for a ride?
- Very much.
What about your guests?
They'll crawl out
under their own steam.
L-I'm going to drive.
Tha-That's understood.
- Don't you need a coat?
- You'll do.
Wait a minute. Let me put this on you.
You might catch cold.
- How am I doing?
- Not bad.
- Scared?
- No.
Oh, no, you're not scared
of anything, are you?
Not too much.
- This fog gets me.
- That's your hair in your eyes.
Oh.
What does the speedometer say?
Sixty-five.
I'm gonna make it 80
and wipe that grin off your face.
I don't like gentlemen
who grin at me.
- A cop.
- What?
A policeman
is chasing us. Look.
He wants to talk to you.
Drunken driving. My second offense.
Now I go to jail.
Whole family in jail.
Who cares?
Havin' a time to yourself,
aren't you?
People like you
ought to be in bed.
- Drunk, huh?
- Just a minute, officer.
No arguments, mister.
You ain't got a leg to stand on.
Sorry, but you didn't speak up.
- That's all right.
- Sure you can handle her?
- No trouble.
- Well, you oughta know.
Where's the ticket?
-
- He didn't give me a ticket.
What was your name?
Devlin.
When you showed that cop
something, he saluted you.
- Did he?
- I saw him.
Why, you double-crossing buzzard!
You're a cop!
All right, we'll argue later.
Get away from my car!
Get out of my car!
- I'm gonna take you home.
- You're not gonna take me home at all!
- Ooh!
- Move over.
- Come on.
- Ow!
Get out of my car,
federal cop!
Crashing my party, just like
that buzzard with the glasses!
Leave me alone! You're trailing me
to get something on me.
Get... out!
Gonna calm down?
Good. Now, move over.
Oh.
- L... I'm not gonna le...
-
Whew!
You'd better drink that.
All right.
Feel better?
What do you care how I feel?
You... You copper.
What's this all about, huh?
- What's your angle?
- What angle?
- About last night.
- Just wanted to be friends.
Friends, yeah.
So you could frame me, hmm?
- No, I've got a job for you.
- Oh, yeah? Don't tell me.
There's only...
Ohhh.
There's only one job that
you coppers would want me for.
Well, you can forget it, Mr...
- Devlin. Devlin.
- What?
I am no stool pigeon,
Mr. Devlin.
My department authorized me
to engage you to do some work for us.
It's a job in Brazil.
Oh, go away.
The whole thing bores me.
Some of the German gentry who were
paying your father are working in Rio.
Ever hear of
the I.G. Farben Industries?
I tell you,
I'm not interested.
Farben has men in South America,
planted there before the war.
We're cooperating with the Brazilian
government to smoke them out.
- My chief thinks
that the daughter of a...
- Of a traitor?
Well, he thinks you might
be valuable in the work.
They might sort of trust you.
And you could make up a little
for your daddy's peculiarities.
- Why should I?
- Patriotism.
That word gives me a pain.
No, thank you.
I don't go for patriotism...
or... or patriots.
I'd like to dispute that with you.
Waving the flag with one hand
and picking pockets with the other.
That's your patriotism.
Well, you can have it.
We've had your bungalow
wired for three months.
"Conversation between John Huberman
and daughter Alicia,
at Miami Beach, Florida."
Some of the evidence
that wasn't used at the trial.
- I don't want to hear that.
- Relax, hard-boiled, and listen.
...money in it, Alicia.
I told you before Christmas
I wouldn't do it.
You don't use your judgment.
You can have anything you want.
- The work is easy.
-  I'll not listen, Father.
This is not your country, is it?
My mother was born here.
We have American citizenship.
Where is yourjudgment?
In your feelings, you are German.
You've got to listen to me.
You don't know what we stand for.
I know what you stand for!
You and your murdering swine.
I've hated you
ever since I found out.
My daughter,
don't talk to me like that.
-
Stay on your side of the table!
- Alicia, put your voice down.
I hate you all.
And I love this country.
Do you understand that?
I love it.
I'll see you all hanged before
I'll raise a finger against it.
Now, go on and get out of here,
or so help me, I'll turn you in.
Don't ever come near me or speak to me
again about your rotten schemes.
Well, that doesn't prove much.
I didn't turn him in.
We didn't expect you to.
Well, what do you say?
Go away and leave me alone.
I have my own life to lead.
Good times.
That's what I want.
And laughs with people I like.
-
- And no underhanded cops who want
to put me in a shooting gallery.
-
- But people of my own kind...
who'll treat me right
and like me and understand me.
-
- Good morning, Alicia.
- Oh, hello.
- Thought you might
need a hand this morning.
- We're sailing with the tide,
you know. Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you've
forgotten, my dear.
- Almost.
I'll help you pack, although
you really don't need anything.
We've got everything on board.
Oh, thank you.
I'll pack myself. L...
We're moored at the hotel pier.
You know the spot.
- Yes.
- You're a darling.
Sweetest girl I ever knew.
See you soon.
Well, what about it?
Plane leaves tomorrow morning, early.
All right.
You better tell him.
Hmm. I'll tell her.
See you later.
He's a very nice-looking man.
You'll be seeing him in Rio.
Oh, no, no.
I won't be seeing any men in Rio.
Oh, yes, you will.
That's our boss, Paul Prescott.
Did he say anything about the job?
- No.
- No hints?
No. But he had some news about your
father he picked up at the last stop.
- What about him?
- He died this morning.
Oh. How?
- Poison capsule.
- He did it himself?
Yes, in his cell. Sorry.
I don't know
why I should feel so bad.
When he told me a few years ago
what he was, everything went to pot.
I didn't care
what happened to me.
But now I remember
how nice he once was.
How nice we both were.
It's a very curious feeling,
as if something had happened
to me and not to him.
You see, I don't
have to hate him anymore.
Or myself.
We're coming into Rio.
Oh, yes. So we are.
I wonder if the embassy
someone can get me a maid.
It's a nice apartment, and I don't mind
dusting and sweeping but I hate cooking.
- I'll ask them.
- And while you're at it,
- find out when I go to work,
and on what.
- Yes, ma'am.
-
- Have another drink?
- No, thank you. I've had enough.
- Oh. Whiskey and soda.
Well, do you hear that?
I'm practically on the wagon.
That's quite a change.
- It's a phase.
- You don't think a woman can change?
Sure. But change is fun...
for a while.
For a while.
What a rat you are, Devlin.
All right. You've been
sober for eight days.
As far as I know,
you've made no new conquests.
Well, that's something.
Eight days.
Practically whitewashed.
I'm very happy, Dev.
Why won't you let me be happy?
Nobody's stopping you.
Why don't you give that
copper's brain of yours a rest?
Every time you look at me,
I can see it dwelling over its slogans:
"Once a crook, always a crook.
Once a tramp, always a tramp."
Go on. You can hold my hand.
I won't blackmail you
for it afterwards.
Scared?
I've always been scared
of women, but I get over it.
And now you're scared of yourself.
You're afraid you'll
fall in love with me.
- That wouldn't be hard.
- Ooh, now, careful, careful.
You enjoy making fun
of me, don't you?
No, Dev.
I'm making fun of myself.
I'm pretending I'm a nice,
unspoiled child...
whose heart is full
of daisies and buttercups.
Nice daydream. Than what?
I think I will have another drink.
I thought you'd get around to it.
Make it a double.
Why won't you believe in me, Dev?
Just a little.
Why won't you?
I know why you won't, Dev.
You're sore.
You're sore because you've
fallen for a little drunk...
you tailed in Miami,
and you don't like it.
Makes you sick all over,
doesn't it?
People will laugh at you, the invincible
Devlin in love with someone...
who isn't worth
even wasting the words on.
Poor Dev, in love with a no-good gal.
It must be awful. I'm sor...
Gentlemen, I assure you
she's a perfect type for the job.
It's not the girl. It's this
German scientist I'm worried about.
I simply question why we don't find
some way of taking them into custody.
It'd do no good. Even if we arrested
their leader Alexander Sebastian,
tomorrow another Farben man
takes his place and their work goes on.
Yes, you're right. I see, Captain
Prescott, your method is the best way.
Well, she's good at making
friends with gentlemen,
and we want somebody inside
his house, in his confidence.
You have faith in this procedure,
Captain Prescott?
Oh, yes.
With somebody on the inside...
- Have you consulted the young lady?
- No, not yet.
As a matter of fact, our man Devlin just
brought here down here the other day.
Now we're waiting for Sebastian
to come back to Rio.
Has your Mr. Devlin told her
the nature of the work?
No, we haven't discussed it
with him at all. But I can set
your mind at rest about her.
- You're sure of her political side?
- Oh, oh, yes.
Well, there is nothing to be lost
if we proceed as you advise.
Now, that's fine. I'll give Devlin
his instructions right away.
It's nice out here.
Let's not go out for dinner.
Let's stay here.
We have to eat.
We can eat here.
I'll cook.
I thought you didn't
like to cook.
No, I don't like to cook.
But I have a chicken in the icebox,
and you're eating it.
What about all the washing up
afterward?
We'll eat it with our fingers.
Don't we need any plates?
Yes. One for you and one for me.
Mind if I have dinner
with you tonight?
I'd be delighted.
- Where are you going?
- Well, if we're going to stay in,
I have to telephone the hotel,
see if there are any messages.
- You have to?
- I have to.
This is a very strange
love affair.
Why?
Maybe the fact
that you don't love me.
Hello? Palace Hotel?
Parle Anglais?
This is T.R. Devlin.
Are there any messages for me?
When I don't love you,
I'll let you know.
You haven't said anything.
- Actions speak louder than words.
-
There is? Good.
Read it to me, please.
Prescott wants me over
right away.
- Did he say what about?
- No.
- Maybe it's our assignment.
- Probably.
Do you want me to bring
anything back with me?
Yes. What about a nice bottle of wine?
We'll celebrate.
What time shall I come back?
Seven o'clock.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
What is it, Devlin?
What's the matter?
- I don't know if she'll do it.
- What do you mean,
you don't think she'd...
- You haven't discussed it
with her, have you?
- I didn't know what the job was.
Well, what do you mean,
she wouldn't do it?
Well, I don't think she's that type
of woman. She strikes me as being...
- Why do you think she won't do it?
- Well, she's had no experience.
Oh, come now. What experience
does she lack, do you think?
She's never been trained for that
kind of work. They'll see through her.
Miss Huberman was chosen
not only because her father...
gives her an ideal background,
but because Sebastian knows her.
Oh, yes. He was once
in love with her.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I don't see why we're arguing
about petty things like this.
We've got important work to do.
Sebastian's house is a cover-up...
for whatever this Farben
group's up to here in Rio.
We've got to get Miss Huberman
inside that house and find out
what's going on there.
So I think you'd better go back
to Miss Huberman and explain
to her what she has to do.
- I, uh...
- Well, what is it?
- Nothing, sir.
- Oh, I thought you were
going to say something.
- How is the meeting to be arranged?
- Oh, well, we've discussed that.
I think the riding club
would be the best place.
Sebastian usually
rides there in the mornings.
So the rest is up to you
and Miss Huberman.
- Okay, Devlin, that's all.
- All right.
-  Dev, is that you?
- Uh-huh.
I'm glad you're late. This chicken
took longer than I expected.
What did they say?
Hope it isn't done too much.
It caught fire once.
I think it's better
if I cut it up out here.
Unless you want a half a one
to yourself.
We're going to have
knives and forks after all.
I've decided we're
going to eat in style.
Marriage must be wonderful with this
sort of thing going on every day.
I wonder if it's too cold out here.
Maybe we should eat inside.
Hasn't something like this
happened before?
What's the matter?
Don't look so tense.
Troubles?
Well, handsome, I think you'd better
tell mama what's going on.
All this secrecy's going
to ruin my little dinner.
Come on, Mr. D.,
what is darkening your brow?
- After dinner.
- No, now.
Look, I'll make it easy for you.
The time has come...
when you must tell me that you have
a wife and two adorable children...
and this madness between us
can't go on any longer.
I'll bet you've heard
that line often enough.
Right below the belt every time.
Oh, that isn't fair, Dev.
Skip it. We have other things
to talk about. We've got a job.
Oh. So there is a job.
You, uh... You remember
a man named Sebastian?
- Alex Sebastian?
- Yes.
One of my father's friends, yes.
He had quite a crush on you.
I wasn't very responsive.
Well, he's here. The head
of a large German business concern.
His family always had money.
He's part of the combine that
built up the German war machine
and hopes to keep on going.
- Something big?
- It has all the earmarks
of being something big.
We have to contact him.
Go on.
Let's have all of it.
We're meeting him tomorrow.
The rest is up to you.
You've got to work on him
and land him.
Mata Hari.
She makes love for the papers.
There are no papers.
You land him.
Find out what's going on
inside his house,
what the group around him
is up to, and report to us.
I suppose you knew about this pretty
little job of mine all the time.
No. I only just
found out about it.
Did you say anything?
I mean, that maybe I wasn't
the girl for such shenanigans?
I figured that was up to you.
- If you'd care to back out...
- I suppose you told them,
"Alicia Huberman will have this
Sebastian eating out of her
hand in a couple of weeks.
- She's good at that. Always was."
- I didn't say anything.
Not a word for that little
lovesick lady you left an hour ago?
I told you,
that's the assignment.
Oh, well, now,
don't get sore, Dev.
I'm only fishing for
a little bird call from my dream man.
One little remark such as,
"How dare you gentlemen
suggest that Alicia Huberman...
the new Miss Huberman...
be submitted to so ugly a fate?"
That's not funny.
Do you want me to take the job?
- You're answering for yourself.
- I am asking you.
It's up to you.
Not a peep, hmm?
Oh, darling, what you didn't
tell them, tell me...
that you believe I'm nice and that
I love you and I'll never change back.
I'm waiting for your answer.
What a little pal you are.
Never believing me, hmm?
Not a word of faith.
Just down the drain with Alicia.
That's where she belongs.
Oh, Dev, Dev.
When do I go to work
for Uncle Sam?
Tomorrow morning.
Oh, we shouldn't have had this out here.
It's all cold now.
What are you looking for?
I had a bottle of champagne.
I must have left it somewhere.
In case you're asked,
I'm with Pan American Airways.
- As Devlin?
- Yes. Public relations office.
Anything else?
No, except we met on the plane
coming in from Miami.
Less detail, the better.
- Are you sure that's him?
- Yes.
We'll go by him easy,
let him spot you. Come on.
I guess I'm the girl
nobody remembers.
- Was it Sebastian?
- Yes.
We'll stick around,
give him another chance.
My dear Alicia, will you
forgive me for being late?
Last minute conference at the office.
You got my message?
- Yes. It's all right, Alex.
- Sweet of you to wait.
- I was afraid you might run on.
- Oh, I'm not that easily put off.
I was too anxious
to meet you again.
You know, I'm tired.
The worst thing about business
is it makes you feel old and look old.
You seem to have escaped
all of that.
Four years of dullness
and disintegration. Awful.
Alex, you look younger
than you did in Washington.
Well, it's a temporary improvement,
entirely due to your presence, my dear.
You always affected me like a tonic.
Perhaps now
with you here in Rio...
unless you insist
on running away from me again...
Oh, uh, would you like
another drink?
- Yes. Thank you.
- Deux martinis.
You know him?
No, I don't think so.
But he seems familiar.
Captain Prescott,
intelligence man.
He's down here as part
of a Washington espionage.
- The American embassy
is loaded with them.
- Really?
Hey, he's rather
handsome, isn't he?
I'm allergic
to American agents.
Their fine points don't
particularly appeal to me.
Have the bothered you
since you came down?
No. No, not yet.
They were troublesome in Miami?
Yes. That's why I left
right after the trial,
to get away from their snooping.
I wondered why
you left your father.
He insisted.
He was so unselfish.
He kept worrying about me,
begging me to leave.
I had no idea
he was going to die.
Many things have died
for all of us.
We mustn't let our spirit
die with them.
Perhaps I can help you
to forget. I'd like to.
It's odd...
but I feel at home with you.
You know, my dear,
I knew this was going to happen.
I knew when we met the other day
that if I saw you again,
I'd feel what I used to for you.
Oh, now I'm going
to make a fool of myself again.
There's someone else, of course.
Who is it this time?
That Mr. Devlin you were with?
There is no one.
Mr. Devlin has pestered me with his
attentiveness ever since I arrived.
- I met him on the plane from Miami.
- You made a pretty couple.
Oh, Alex, Mr. Devlin
doesn't interest me.
I was so lonely that day, I could
have gone riding with Peter Rabbit.
You'll let me help
your loneliness?
You are very sweet to forget
what a brat I was... once.
My dear, I shall test out
your repentance at once.
Will you have dinner with me
again tomorrow night?
- Thank you very much.
- My house?
- Yes, how nice.
- My mother is giving a dinner party.
She won't mind an extra guest?
An old friend
is never an extra guest.
Well, shall we order now?
- Yes, yes. I'm starved.
- Garcon.
Now, let's see, what shall we...
what shall we have for our first
dinner together?
- Good evening.
- Very good.
Yes, yes, isn't it?
Oh, I'd like you to wear these.
They're rented for the occasion.
Oh. All right.
Would you help me,
please? L...
- Why-Why, yes, certainly.
- Thank you.
So, uh, the old boy knew me, eh?
Yes. He thought
you were very handsome.
Oh, you don't say?
Sorry I'm not going with you.
- Oh, Dev'll pick those up later.
- All right.
Now, try to memorize the names
of all the people you see there tonight.
The men, I mean. And get their
nationalities. That's very important.
You mean the Germans?
That won't be difficult for me.
And I suggest that you don't ask any
questions. Just use your eyes and ears.
They're a pretty keen and desperate
bunch. Don't underestimate them.
Right. Thank you for your
instructions. Good evening.
Oh, by the way, unless you have
something very urgent to report,
I suggest that you two keep shy
of each other for the next few days.
That's in case Sebastian's people
want to check on you after your visit.
- Yes, I understand.
- That's all. Good luck.
- Good evening.
- Good night.
- ##
- Good evening. I'm Miss Huberman.
Will you tell Mr. Sebastian
that I'm here?
- Miss Huberman?
- Yes.
Please forgive me
for keeping you waiting.
- Not at all.
- You resemble your father very much.
- I'm Alex's mother.
- I knew when I saw you.
Alex has always admired you.
Now at last I know why.
You're very kind.
You did not testify at your father's
trial. We thought that unusual.
He didn't want me to. He refused
to let his lawyers call me on the stand.
I wonder why.
I'm so glad.
You met my mother.
- Yes, we just met.
- You didn't meet Alicia...
when we were in Washington
four years ago, did you, Mother?
I don't know where
you were at the time.
Alex, I think we should
join our other guests.
- May I take your wrap?
- Thank you.
Miss Huberman,
may I present Eric Mathis?
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Very honored.
Delighted.
Dr. Anderson.
It gives me great pleasure.
Dr. Anderson is our guest
of honor tonight.
You mustn't bore Miss Huberman,
Alex, with discourses on science.
Not before dinner, anyway.
Dinner is served, madame.
Dr. Anderson, you will sit
beside me, over there.
Eric, you will sit
next to Miss Huberman.
You have just come from Spain, senora?
A few weeks ago. It seems ages.
Travel does not mean anything
anymore. It goes so swift.
-
- One has the feeling
of not going anywhere.
I suppose we can expect
rocket ships to be carrying us
across the ocean very soon.
You can expect many strange things.
- See a good movie
this afternoon, Eric?
- No. I was disappointed.
Hmm, must have been a comedy. You know,
Eric loves to go to the movies to cry.
He's very sentimental.
It takes nearly as long to go
from the city to the airport...
as it does to cross
over the Atlantic.
I'm afraid, gentlemen, that
something must be done about Emil.
I don't know. It was an understandable
slip. The man was tired.
No. It was
a very dangerous slip.
It's not the first one. There have been
several other lapses before.
There'll be more,
if we permit them.
That's bad.
That's very bad.
I think, gentlemen, you can
leave it to me to find some way.
When you drive up to Petropolis,
the road winds quite a bit.
It is very high.
There are some
very awkward turns.
I'm sure I will not have
any difficulty in getting Emil
to give me a lift in his car.
It's quite a trick to jump clear.
I'll just have to be careful,
that is all.
Turned my ankle the last time.
Madame says,
will you join the others...
or will you take
your coffee in here?
Oh, I think we'll take
coffee in here, Emil.
I'm very sorry, gentlemen,
to make such an exhibition.
Ah, nonsense.
We all have nerves.
You have been overworking.
Don't you think so, Rossner?
You need a rest. Your health
is very important to us.
Oh, that's very considerate.
I am very tired.
So, now I think perhaps
if-if you'll make my pardon...
to the ladies, Alex, for my
leaving so early, then l...
Maybe, Emil, it would be better
if I came with you.
I think that perhaps
if you try to drive yourself...
all the way up to Petropolis,
it might be too much for you.
I shall drive you.
No. That would be
too much for you.
All that way.
That's too much to ask.
Nonsense.
I'd love to go.
Come on, Emil.
Good night, gentlemen.
Good night, Alex.
I hope you'll feel better
in the morning, Emil.
Thank you.
And I'm very sorry...
to make a scene
before strangers.
Very sorry.
Thank you, Alex,
for an excellent dinner.
And please tell your mother
for me that the dessert was superb.
Miss Huberman has
been gone a long time.
Mother, is it necessary for you to
always address Alicia as Miss Huberman?
I do wish you'd be
a little more cordial to her.
Really, I thought I was
behaving rather well.
- Has she been complaining about me?
- Oh, no.
- I'm grateful.
- You might smile at her.
Wouldn't it be a little too much if
we both grinned at her like idiots?
Please, Mother,
I want to enjoy myself.
Is it so boring
to sit with me alone?
Not at all, not at all.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.
- I thought I saw you.
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
Great turnout, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Where are they?
- In a box in the stand.
I don't think they can see us,
Alex and his mother.
Don't telephone me anymore.
Just rely upon my popping up.
- Can you hear me?
- Sure. Go ahead.
Heard of a Dr. Anderson?
- No.
- He's some kind of a scientist.
Kind face, 60 years old, gray hair,
deep crease in forehead.
- Tall or short?
- Short.
- Uh-huh.
- Emil Hupka? Heard of him?
No.
He made quite a scene
about a wine bottle the other night.
