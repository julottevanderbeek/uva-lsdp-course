I need a father who's a role model,
not some horny geek boy...
who's going to spray his shorts whenever
I bring a girlfriend home from school.
What a lame-o.
Someone really should just put him
out of his misery.
You want me to kill him for you?
Yeah. Would you?
My name is Lester Burnham.
I'm 42 years old.
In less than a year, I'll be dead.
Of course,
I don't know that yet.
And in a way,
I'm dead already.
Look at me:
Jerking off in the shower.
This will be the high point of my day.
It's all downhill from here.
See the way the handle on those pruning
shears matches her gardening clogs?
- That's not an accident.
-
Hush, Bitsy!
- Hush. What is wrong with you?
- That's our next-door neighbour, Jim.
- And that's his lover, Jim.
-
- You spoil her.
Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now.
- Me?
- Come on. Yes. Inside.
-  Good morning, Jim!
Good morning, Carolyn.
I love your tie!
That colour!
I just love your roses. How do you
get them to flourish like this?
Well, I'll tell you:
Eggshells and Miracle-Gro.
- I've never heard that.
- Man, I get exhausted just watching her.
She wasn't always like this.
She used to be happy.
My daughterJane.
Only child.
- Janie's a pretty typical teenager:
-
I wish I could tell her that's all going
to pass, but I don't want to lie to her.
Jane, honey, are you trying
to look unattractive?
- Yes.
- Congratulations.
You've succeeded admirably.
Lester, could you make me
a little later, please,
because I'm not quite late enough.
Nice going, Dad.
Both my wife and
daughter think I'm this gigantic loser.
I'm not exactly sure
what it is,
but I know
I didn't always feel this...
It's never too late
to get it back.
Hello. This is Lester Burnham
from Media Monthly magazine.
I'm calling
for Mr Tamblin, please.
Well, we're all under
a deadline here. You see,
there's some basic information...
about your product launch
that isn't even covered
in your press release, and I'd...
Yeah, c...
can I ask you a question?
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.
Yeah. Okay.
I'll leave my number.
Lester Burnham.
Thank you!
Hey, Les.
You got a minute?
For you, Brad,
I got five!
So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.
Oh, sure.
Times are tight.
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.
- Right?
- Exactly.
Like the time that Mr Flournoy
used the company MasterCard
to pay for that hooker,
and she used the card numbers
and stayed at the St. Regis for,
what was it, three months?
- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $50,000.
That's somebody's salary.
That's somebody who's going
to get fired because Craig
has to pay women to fuck him!
I mean, calm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.
-
- That's why we're having everyone...
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute.
That way management
can assess who's valuable...
And who's expendable.
I've been writing
for this magazine for 14 years.
- You've been here how long?
A whole month?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.
I'm trying to level with you.
This is your one chance
to save your job.
There is no decision.
You just write the damn thing.
-  You don't think
it's weird and kind of fascist?
- Possibly.
- But you don't want to be unemployed.
- All right.
Let's just all sell our souls
and work for Satan 'cause
it's more convenient that way.
Oh, could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please, huh?
So, we finally
got new neighbours.
You know, if the Lomans
had let me represent them
instead of the Real Estate King,
that house would never
have sat on the market for six months.
Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.
Their sycamore?
Come on.
A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.
You know that.
How can you call it their sycamore?
I wouldn't have the heart to just cut
down something if it wasn't partially
mine, which, of course, it was.
-
- Mom, do we always have to listen
to this elevator music?
No. No, we don't.
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savoury meal that I'm about to eat,
you can listen
to whatever you like.
So, Janie, how was school?
It was okay.
Just okay?
No, Dad.
It was spectacular.
Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today?
They've hired
this efficiency expert,
this really friendly guy
named Brad...
How perfect is that?
And he's basically there
to make it seem they're justified...
in firing somebody,
because they couldn't just come
out and say that, could they?
No, no. That would just be too honest.
So they've asked us...
You couldn't
possibly care less, could you?
What do you expect?
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.
I mean, hello, you've barely even
spoken to me for months.
Oh, what?
You're "Mother of the Year"?
-
You treat her like an employee.
- What?
What?
I'm going
to get some ice cream.
Janie...
I'm sorry I haven't
been more available.
I'm just... l...
You know, you don't always
have to wait for me to come to you.
Oh, great.
So now it's my fault?
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fault. It...
Janie, what happened?
We used to be pals.
##
##
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.
Welcome.
I'm Carolyn Burnham.
This living room
is very dramatic.
Wait till you see
the native stone fireplace!
A simple cream could
really lighten things up.
You could even put in a skylight.
Well, why don't we
go into the kitchen?
It's a dream come true
for any cook.
Just filled
with positive energy, huh?
And you'll be surprised
how much a ceiling fan can
cut down on your energy costs.
You know, you could have some fun
backyard get-togethers out here.
The ad said this pool was lagoon-like.
There's nothing lagoon-like about it.
Except for maybe the bugs.
There aren't even any plants out here.
What do you call this?
Is this not a plant?
If you have a problem with the plants, I
can always call my landscape architect.
- Solved.
- I mean, I think "lagoon,"
I think waterfall, tropical.
This is a cement hole.
Uh...
I have some tiki torches
in the garage.
Shut up! Stop it!
You weak... You baby!
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
-
-
Who are you looking for?
My parents are coming tonight.
They're trying to, you know,
take an active interest in me.
Gross. I hate it
when my mom does that.
They're such assholes. Why can't
they just have their own lives?
What makes you sure she wants us
to be there? Did she ask us to come?
Of course not. She doesn't want us
to know how important this is to her.
But she's been practising
for weeks.
I'll bet she's going to
resent it, and I'm missing
the James Bond marathon on T.N.T.
Lester, this is important.
I'm sensing a real distance
growing between you and Jane.
"Growing"?
She hates me.
- She's just wilful.
- She hates you too.
- Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.
-
- Hi! Patty!
Now, for your halftime entertainment,
Rockwell High's award-winning
Dancing Spartanettes!
We can leave
right after this, right?
Shit. They're still here.
Janie!
Hey, I really enjoyed that.
- Congratulations, honey. You were great.
- I didn't win anything.
- Hi. I'm Lester, Janie's dad.
- Oh, hi.
This is my friend,
Angela Hayes.
Okay. Good to meet you.
You were also good tonight,
very... precise.
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you, Angela.
Honey...
I am so proud of you.
You know, I watched you very closely.
You didn't screw up once.
Okay, uh, we have to go.
- So what are you girls doing now?
- Dad.
- We're going out for pizza.
- Really? Do you need a ride?
We can give you a ride.
- I have a car.
You want to come with us?
- Thanks, but I have a car.
You have a car.
That's great. That's great.
Janie's thinking about
getting a car, too, soon, aren't you?
Dad, Mom's waiting for you.
Well, it was very nice
meeting you, Angela.
is a... friend of mine.
Well... I'll be
seeing you around, then.
Could he be any more...
pathetic?
I think he's sweet.
And I think he and your mother
have not had sex in a long time.
It's the weirdest thing.
I feel like I've been in a coma
for about 20 years...
I'm so sorry
my dad was weird tonight.
That's okay.
I'm used to guys
drooling over me.
It started
when I was about 12.
I'd go to dinner
with my parents.
Every Thursday night: Red Lobster.
Every guy there would stare at me
when I walked in.
And I knew
what they were thinking,
just like I knew guys at school thought
about me when they jerked off.
- Vomit.
- No. I liked it.
I still like it. If people I don't even
know look at me and want to fuck me,
it means I really have a shot
at being a model.
Which is great,
because there's nothing worse in life
than being ordinary.
I really think
it'll happen for you.
I know.
Because everything that was meant
to happen, does... eventually.
Asshole.
Hello? Hello?
-
-
- Hello?
- Why'd you call me?
I didn't.
Well, my phone just rang and
I answered it, and somebody hung up.
- And I star-69ed,
and I called you back.
- Well, I was in the shower.
Oh, gross!
Ricky! Breakfast!
Be right there.
- Mom.
- Hello.
I don't eat bacon, remember?
I'm sorry.
I must've forgotten.
What's new in the world, Dad?
This country
is going straight to hell.
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.
No.
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighbourhood.
- It's just a little something
from our garden.
- Except for the pasta.
- We got that at Fallaci's.
- Right. It's unbelievably fresh.
You just... You drop it
in the water, and it's done.
Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down.
Welcome to the neighbourhood.
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.
- It's nice to meet you.
This is my partner...
- Jim Berkley, but call me J.B.
Let's cut to chase, okay?
What are you guys selling?
-  We...
- Nothing. We just wanted to
say hi to our new neighbours.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said you're
partners, so what's your business?
Well... he is a tax attorney.
And he's an anaesthesiologist.
##
How come these faggots
always have to rub it in your face?
How can they
be so shameless?
- ##
- That's the whole thing, Dad.
They don't feel that's anything
to be ashamed of.
Well, it is.
- Yeah, you're right.
- Don't placate me
like I'm your mother, boy.
Forgive me, sir,
for speaking so bluntly,
but those fags make me want
to puke my fucking guts out.
Well, me too, son.
Yeah. Me too.
I'm serious. Hejust
pulled down his pants and yanked it out.
- You know, like,
"Say hello to Mr Happy."
- Gross!
- It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.
- So did you do it with him?
Of course. He's a really
well-known photographer.
He shoots for Elle on,
like, a regular basis.
- It would've been majorly stupid
of me to turn him down.
- You are a total prostitute.
Hey, that's how
things really are.
You just don't know because you're
this pampered little suburban chick.
So are you. You've only been
in Seventeen once, and you looked fat.
So stop acting like you're
goddamn Christy Turlington!
Cunt!
I am so sick of people
taking their insecurities out on me.
- Oh, my God. That's the pervert
who filmed me last night.
- Him?
Jane. No way.
He's a total lunatic.
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.
We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade,
and he would always save
the most random, weird things.
And then one day,
he was just, like, gone.
And then Connie Cardullo told me
that his parents had to put him
in a mental institution.
Why? What did he do?
What do you mean?
Well, they can't put you away
just for saying weird things.
You total slut.
You've got a crush on him.
- What? Please!
- You are defending him. You love him.
- You want to have, like,
- Shut up.
Hi. My name's Ricky.
I just moved next door to you.
I know.
I kind of remember this creepy incident
where you were filming me last night?
- I didn't mean to scare you.
I just think you're interesting.
- Thanks.
But I really don't need to have some
psycho obsessing about me right now.
I'm not obsessing.
I'm just curious.
What a freak.
And why does he dress
like a Bible salesman?
He's, like, so confident.
I don't believe him.
I mean, he didn't even,
like, look at me once.
##
- How'd you get in the Army?
- Sergeant, I got three reasons
for being in the Army.
First, I'm patriotic. Second, I love
my country. And third, they nailed me.
Hey.
- What's going on here?
- Bend all the way down.
Here comes the Bull of the Woods.
I'm sorry. What?
Mom, nobody said anything.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Everyone here is with their spouse
or significant other.
- How would it look
if I showed up with no one?
- You always end up ignoring me.
Now, listen to me.
This is an important business function.
As you know, my business
is selling an image,
and part of my job
is to live that image.
Honey, do me a favour and say
whatever you want to say
and spare me the propaganda.
All right.
Hi, Shirley!
Listen. Just do me a favour.
Act happy tonight.
-  I am happy, honey!
- You're not... Oh, that's Buddy!
- Buddy! Buddy! Hi!
- Hi.
Good to see you again.
- It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
- Carolyn.
Oh, Carolyn! Of course.
How are you?
- Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
- Hello.
- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.
Oh, we've met before,
actually. This thing last year.
Christmas at the Sheraton.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either.
Honey, don't be weird.
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- Okay.
I'll be whatever
you want me to be.
Well, oka...
- We have a very healthy relationship.
- I see.
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I need a drink.
Ohh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Put a little more in there, cowboy.
Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood
Trail? The house with the red door?
- Yeah.
- I'm Ricky Fitts.
I just moved in the house next to you.
Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts.
I'm Lester Burnham.
Hi, Lester Burnham.
- Do you party?
- Excuse me?
Do you get high?
You know, I probably wouldn't
even tell you this if I weren't
a little tipsy, but...
I'm in complete awe of you.
I mean, your firm...
is hands-down the Rolls-Royce
of local real estate firms,
and your personal
sales record is...
It's very intimidating.
You know, I'd love to sit down
with you and just pick your brain,
-
- If you'd ever be willing.
You know, I suppose technically
I'm the competition,
but I mean, hey,
I don't flatter myself...
that I'm even
in the same league as you.
I don't.
I'd love to.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.
I'll do that.
Thank you.
Did you ever see that movie
where the body is walking around...
carrying its own head, and then
the head goes down on that babe?
-
-  Re-Animator.
-
- Look.
I'm not paying you to do whatever
it is you're doing out here.
Fine. So don't pay me.
Excuse me?
I quit, so you don't have
to pay me. Now leave me alone.
Asshole.
I think you just
became my personal hero.
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that?
Well, I guess when
you're all of, what, 16...
Eighteen. I just do
these gigs as a cover.
I have other sources of income.
But my dad interferes less
in my life when I pretend...
to be an upstanding young citizen
with a respectable job.
Lester?
- What are you doing?
- Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts.
This is Ricky Fitts.
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
into the house next to you.
I go to school
with your daughter.
- With Jane?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Jane.
Hi. I'm ready to go.
I'll meet you out front.
-
Oh, I'm in trouble.
-
Nice meeting you, Ricky.
Thanks for the thing.
Anytime. Lester?
If you want any more,
you know where I live.
- ##
-
Oh, shit. They're home. Quick.
Let's go up to my room.
I should say hi
to your dad.
I don't want to be rude.
Nice suit.
You're looking good,
Mr Burnham.
Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.
Ooh, is that root beer?
I love root beer,
don't you?
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.
- Remember Angela?
Yes, of course.
I forgot to tell you. She's going
to spend the night. Is that okay?
-  Sorry about my dad.
-
Don't be. I think it's funny.
Yeah, to you he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.
But to me, he's just...
too embarrassing to live.
Well, your mom's the one
who's embarrassing. What a phoney.
- But your dad's actually kind of cute.
- Shut up.
He is. If hejust
worked out a little, he'd be hot.
- Shut up!
- Come on.
Like you've never sneaked a peek
at him in his underwear?
I bet he's got a big dick.
You are so grossing me out right now.
If he built up his chest
and arms, I would totally fuck him.
- # La, la, la, la, la, la #
- I would. I would suck
your dad's big fat dick,
and then I'd fuck him until
his eyes rolled back in his head.
-
- Jane, shh. What was that noise?
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.
That was the sound of you
being a huge, disgusting pig.
- No, I'm serious.
-
See?
- Oh, my God. Jane.
- What is it?
Jane, what if he worships you?
What if he's got a shrine
with pictures of you surrounded
by dead people's heads and stuff?
Shit. I bet
he's filming us right now.
Really?
Welcome to
America's Weirdest Home Videos.
-
-  Ricky?
Coming, Dad.
You know I don't like
locked doors in my house, boy.
- I'm sorry.
I must've locked it by accident.
- Mm.
So what's up?
L... I need a urine sample.
Wow.
It's been six months already.
Can I give it to you in the morning?
I just took a whiz.
Yeah. I suppose.
Y-You know...
Well, good night, son.
I've been waiting for you.
You've been working out,
haven't you?
I can tell.
I was hoping you could
give me a bath.
I'm very, very dirty.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
- You were masturbating.
-  I was not.
Yes, you were.
Oh, all right.
So shoot me. I was whacking off.
That's right. I was choking
the bishop, chafing the carrot.
You know, saying "hi"
to my monster.
That's disgusting.
Well, excuse me, but some of us still
have blood pumping through our veins.
- So do I.
- Really?
Well, I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it.
Lester, I refuse to live like this!
This is not a marriage.
This hasn't been
a marriage for years,
but you were happy as long
as I kept my mouth shut.
Well, guess what.
I've changed.
And the new me whacks off
when he feels horny...
'cause you're obviously not going
to help me out in that department.
I see. You think you're the
only one who's sexually frustrated.
I'm not? Well, then,
come on, baby. I'm ready.
Don't you mess
with me, mister.
I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.
On what grounds?
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.
I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantly clear...
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be!
But... I did support you
when you got your licence.
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.
Oh!
So, turn out the light
when you come back to bed, okay?
It's a great thing
when you realize you still have...
the ability
to surprise yourself.
Makes you wonder what else you can do
that you've forgotten about.
Hey, guys.
Lester. I didn't know you ran.
- I just started.
- Good for you.
I figured you guys might be
able to give me some pointers.
I need to shape up, fast.
Are you looking to just lose weight,
or do you want to have...
increased strength
and flexibility as well?
L... I want
to look good naked.
Oh, what is this?
Fuckin'gay pride parade?
Hey! Yo, Ricky.
My entire life is passing
before my eyes, and those two
have barely broken a sweat.
Sorry. Hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.
Oh, whoa. Well.
Welcome to the neighbourhood, sir.
Ricky, uh...
I was thinking about the, uh...
I was gonna... The movie we talked about.
- Re-Animator.
- Yeah!
You want to borrow it?
Okay. It's up in my room. Come on.
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Sure.
I don't think my dad would try
to come in while someone else
is here, but you never know.
- What is this?
- Urine.
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.
Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me last night.
It's not mine.
One of my clients is a nurse
in a paediatrician's office.
Cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.
You like Pink Floyd?
I like a lot of music.
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.
How much do you want?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce?
This is totally decent,
and it's 300.
Wow!
This shit is
top of the line.
It's called G-13. It's genetically
engineered by the U.S. Government.
It's extremely potent, but
a completely mellow high. No paranoia.
Is that what we smoked
last night?
This is all I ever smoke.
- How much?
- Two grand.
Jesus!
Things have changed since 1973.
- You don't have to pay now.
I know you're good for it.
- Thanks.
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.
And I only accept cash.
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.
God. When I was your age,
I flipped burgers all summer
just to buy an eight-track.
- That sucks.
- No, actually it was great.
All I did was party
and get laid.
I had my whole life
ahead of me.
My dad thinks I pay for all
this with catering jobs.
Never underestimate
the power of denial.

# There must be some way
out of here
# Said thejoker
to the thief
- I can't get no relief
- What the hell do you
think you're doing?
- Uh-oh. Mom's mad.
-
Bench presses.
I'm going to whale on my pecks,
and then I'm going to do my back.
I see you're smoking pot now.
L... I'm so glad.
I think using illegal
psychotropic substances...
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.
Uh... Lester!
You have such hostility in you.
Do you mind? I'm trying to work
out here. Unless... you want to spot me.
Lester, you will not
get away with this.
- You can be sure of that.
- There are many here among us
- That's... what...
- Who feel that life is but a joke
you... think.
"My job consists of
basically masking...
"my contempt for
the assholes in charge...
"and at least once a day
retiring to the men's room...
"so I can jerk off...
"while I fantasize
about a life...
that doesn't so closely
resemble hell."
Well, you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself.
Brad, for 14 years, I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.
The only way I could save myself now
is if I start firebombing.
Whatever. Management wants you
gone by the end of the day.
Just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me,
considering the information
I have about our editorial director...
buying pussy
with company money?
Which I think
would interest the I.R.S.,
since it technically
constitutes fraud.
And I'm sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications...
might like to know about it as well,
not to mention... Craig's wife.
- What do you want?
- One year's salary with benefits.
That's not going to happen.
What do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot?
Against who?
Against you.
Can you prove that you
didn't offer to save my job...
if I let you blow me?
Man... you are
one twisted fuck.
Nope. I'm just
an ordinary guy...
with nothing to lose.
Yeah.
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.
- I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Oh.
Christy left for New York
this morning.
Let's just say things were
a little... hectic around the house.
- What's she doing in New York?
- She's moving there.
Yes, we are splitting up.
Buddy. I'm so sorry.
Yes. According to her, I'm...
too focused on my career.

- As if being driven to succeed is...
some sort of a character flaw.
Well, she certainly did
take advantage of the lifestyle
my success afforded her.
Ooh! Ha. Wow.
- Ah, it's for the best.
- Mm-hmm.
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.
Well, call me crazy,
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,
one must project
an image of success...
- I was filming this dead bird.
- Why?
I think maybe you forgot
your medication today, mental boy.
Hi, Jane.
I want you to stop filming me.
Okay.
Well, whatever. This is boring.
Let's go.
- Do you need a ride?
- Are you crazy?
