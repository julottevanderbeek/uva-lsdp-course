Os iusti meditabitur sapientiam
The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom
Et lingua eius loquetur indicium
And his tongue shall speak judgment
Beatus vir qui suffert tentationem
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation
Quoniam cum probatus fuerit accipient coronam vitae
For when he hath been proved, he
shall receive a crown of life
Kyrie, ignis divine, eleison
Lord, fire divine, have mercy
O quam sancta, quam serena
Oh how holy, how serene
Quam benigma, quam amoena
How benign, how pleasant
O castitatis lilium
Oh lily of purity
We're both hungry, huh?
Listen up.
Our target has an unidentified weapon
with a two meter radius.
Unidentified? What the hell's that mean?
Its specifics are unknown.
Man...
The police are already working
on searching the city.
Once we receive the information,
we'll immediately head to the site.
Bandoh!
That's stupid!
What're you doing?!
The target is someone we can shoot
without warning, right?
Then it's hunt or be hunted.
It's one or the other!
Hurry up and drop me off!
Oh, right...
Since you looked sad she might have
thought that the seashell was bad.
What're you doing? It's not locked.
I thought this was a vacant house...
I moved in here today.
Excuse me, but...
We're the police.
We'd like you to take a moment to
cooperate with our investigation.
Did something happen?
Have you seen a girl like this?
Did she do something?
Hey! We're the ones asking the questions!
Have you seen her or not?!
Cool it.
She's just a missing person.
Missing...
I don't know her.
I see.
If you see her, could you contact the police?
Thanks.
Let's go.
Okay.
Oh, I didn't lock the door.
This is Satoh from Bandoh Group.
We've arrived at Yuigahama.
We'll continue the search.
We're only authorized to search
the coastlines.
Please don't go places where
people are around.
That's up to our enemy.
They said that our enemy carries a special
weapon, but what do you think it is?
I don't know how to handle it if it's a weapon
we don't know anything about.
Shut up! Can't you keep your
mouth shut for a while?!
If you keep whining, I'll take you out first.
Leader!
Bingo!
Nyu...
Nyu?
Excuse me...
There's someone who's lost, and...
What're you doing in a place like this?
Geez...
You're shivering.
What'll I do with you? Here.
Nyu?
Now, stand up. Can you get up?
Nyu! Nyu! Nyu!
Oh, yeah, they're sticking out.
The horns are sticking out from her head.
You probably shouldn't get too close.
Shut up! Keep quiet!
What're you guys?!
Let's see now. It was okay to kill
witnesses too, right, Satoh?
No, we don't have any orders like that.
We should contact headquarters first.
What do you mean by kill?
You don't understand, dumbass?
Kill means I pull the trigger like this.
And, then, your brains'll splatter
all over and you'll die.
Nyu, run!
She's my prey.
Stay outta my way!
Nyu! Nyu!
Well, you're gonna let me
have some fun, right?
A missing person?
Around what age?
Well...
Yes. Yes.
Understood.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, well, I just remembered someplace
where she's likely to be.
Sorry for bothering you.
Sorry that I had to step out
during the conversation.
No, that's all right.
Our missing person seems to be
pretty troublesome, though.
I was told that SAT's searching the
coastlines without asking us.
Geez, I don't get what they're thinking.
I don't want them to act too conspicuously.
Well then, I'm counting on you.
Yes, sir.
A vicious escapee.
A girl like this, huh?
Kohta!
Kohta!
Come on, Kohta!
What? What happened?
Oh! I'll call an ambulance right away!
Nyu! Where's Nyu?!
Kohta!
Hang in there!
Kohta!
It may be the wrong person.
She seems too different from
the person in the report.
Leader!
Have you seen any human with horns
sticking out besides her?
But...
This is Satoh at Bandoh Group.
We captured someone who
appears to be Lucy.
We're at Yuigahama.
Don't do anything without my orders!
Now the fun begins.
You've killed so many up until now, right?
Let's have a duel. A duel!
Nyu...
Hey!
What the hell's wrong with you?
You're a bloodthirsty killer, aren't you?!
Give me a beating, come on!
Hey, wait a second.
What'd you just hide?
Show it to me! Hey!
Could it be the lethal weapon?
Don't be stupid!
If you have the so-called weapon, bring it on!
Now!
I don't care any more.
Well, Leader!
Satoh, you can go ahead and kill her.
I said kill her. It's our job, right?
But...
Never mind, just shoot. It's an order.
Roger.
Sorry. This is my job.
Shit!
What the...
Leade...
What the hell are you?!
Is this for real?
A hand?
You're just trying to throw
stuff at me till you hit!
Throwing?
Our target has a weapon that causes
certain death within a two meter radius.
So that's it. Two meter invisible hands.
Those are your...
This is fun!
What is it?
Geez. This is too cool, huh?
Die! You occult bitch!
That's not fair, is it?
Are you enjoying this?
You damn bitch!
You bitch.
How dare you...
How dare you cut my arm off?
You bitch.
Just wait and see.
I'll never forget your face!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you, damn it!
I'll kill you!
This isn't fun anymore.
Nyu?
Where the hell'd you go?! I'll kill you!
Hey, where the hell'd you go?!
Come back!
Hey! Where the hell are you?!
Where the hell'd you go?!
Excuse me. What happened?
I'll fuckin' kill you! I'll kill you!
Excuse me.
I'll kill you! Come back!
Don't move!
Who are you?
I'll go get an ambulance now,
so please don't move so recklessly!
Shit.
Kohta!
Kohta!
Oh? Yuka.
Where am I?
What's going on? What happened?
Are you okay?
Please excuse us.
So we meet again.
Give us a moment alone.
A soldier with a machine gun, huh?
In short, you're saying that you
were attacked by some guys
like motorcycle gangsters
with model guns.
No, I'm not. It was definitely...
The girl who was here earlier said
she didn't see anyone like that.
If only there were another witness.
Witness...
Nyu...
There was a girl at the beach.
Is she safe?
Who was she?
I don't know. I just happened to see her.
What were some of her
distinguishing characteristics?
Characteristics. I can't think
of anything in particular.
Things like hairstyle, age,
or something like that!
Especially if you saw something on her head!
Could you tell us just whatever
you remember?
I said it was a girl but she was about
the age of a college student.
She had short hair and was
a little overweight.
Okay, that's enough. Sorry to bother
you when you're injured.
I was told by the doctor earlier that
your injury isn't that bad.
Go home carefully.
But it really was someone
with a machine gun!
There are many motorcycle
gangsters around here.
We'll duly take care of your crime report.
You should forget about it,
for your own good.
I hope she hasn't been killed.
What? What did you say?
Nothing.
Then, I'll stop by again tomorrow.
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine. See you, then.
Nyu.
I'm sorry.
Nyu?
Thank you.
Nyu.
Kohta, please come again next year!
Don't forget about me!
Yeah! I'll come next year again,
Yuka, since I like you.
It's been eight years since then, hasn't it?
Yes?
No, nothing.
The key!
Sir!
Hey, who are you?
Those guys...
Those soldiers and the police are
definitely acting strange.
Nyu?
Even if I say something, I guess
you won't understand it.
But, I've decided that I'll never
let them take you.
All right, then, change into this.
Nyu?
Oh well.
I guess I've got no choice but to
change your clothes myself.
Uhm... Shirt, shirt, shirt...
There it is.
Okay, raise your arms, like this.
Nyu?
Don't worry.
I'm keeping my eyes closed, so...
Let me see...
Nyu!
Sorry!
Next is underwear.
This is the big one.
Listen. Don't move, okay?
There!
So it was a failure.
Yes. From the damage done
to the SAT members,
we could confirm that Lucy came ashore,
but we still haven't tracked her down.
I can't imagine that bloodthirsty
killer will continue to hide quietly.
That may be so, but I don't think
you need to even use #7.
What's her condition?
Since we've been performing pretty
severe experiments continuously,
I don't know if we can use her or not.
Papa.
It was already too cruel to describe
it with the word love.
It was a sad imitation created in a world
where only eternal pain and despair rule,
only to achieve a single goal.
