Come on, lads. Hurry it up.
We haven't got all day.
Is that it, Captain?
Are we here?
Aye, laddie.
That's Bangkok all right.
- Louis! Oh, Louis!
-
- Mother, look. There's Bangkok.
- Come on. Hurry it up.
Yes, I know.
Isn't it exciting?
- Come on, lads. Hurry it up.
- Captain!
I heard them lowering the anchor.
Is anything wrong?
We have to wait for the afternoon tide, ma'am,
to carry us over the bar.
Oh, I see.
Will the king of Siam come down to the dock
to meet us, Mother?
I hardly think so, dear.
Kings don't, as a rule.
Come forward, lads.
They need help in the bow.
Get along! Get along, lads.
It's the royal barge.
The king  coming out
to meet us.
It's not the king.
It's the Kralahome.
Who is the Kralahome?
The king's right-hand man,
you might say
May I look?
Please, may I see?
All right, laddie.
Ma'am, if I might be allowed
to offer you a word of warning...
that man has power,
and he can use it for ye or against ye.
Oh, you must stop worrying about me,
Captain Orton.
Sometimes I wonder if you know
what you're really facing-
an Englishwoman alone
in a country like Siam.
Oh, it doesn't matter, Captain.
I shall have work to do.
And the king has promised me
a house of my own.
I'll have a place to bring up my boy,
as his father would've wished.
Mother, look!
The prime minister is naked!
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Louis.
He can't be naked.
He's only...
half-naked.
They look so cruel, Mother.
Father would not have liked us
to be afraid, would he?
No, Louis. Father would not have
liked us to be afraid-
not ever.
- Doesn't anything ever frighten you, Mother?
- Ooh, yes. Sometimes.
- What do you do?
- I whistle.
Oh, that's why you whistle.
Mm-hmm.
That's why I whistle.
Whenever I feel afraid
I hold my head erect
And whistle a happy tune,
So no one will suspect
I'm afraid
While shivering in my shoes
I strike a careless pose
And whistle a happy tune
And no one ever knows
I'm afraid
The result of this deception
is very strange to tell
For when I fool the people I fear
I fool myself as well!
I whistle a happy tune
And ev'ry single time
The happiness in the tune
convinces me that I'm not afraid.
Make believe you're brave
And the trick will take you far.
You may be as brave
as you make believe you are.
You may be as brave
as you make believe you are.
I think that's a very good idea, Mother-
a very good idea!
Yes, it is a good idea, isn't it?
- I don't think I shall ever be afraid again.
- Good.
The result of this deception
is very strange to tell
For when I fool the people I fear
I fool myself as well!
- Hmm.
-
Mrs. Anna Leonowens.
Mrs. Leonowens, may I present
His Excellency, the Kralahome?
Sir, you are lady who will be schoolmistress
of royal children?
- Yes.
- He called you "sir."
- Hush, dear. Hush.
- Have you friends in Bangkok?
I know no one in Bangkok at all.
-
-
His Excellency wishes to know,
are you married, sir?
I am a widow.
What manner of man,
your deceased husband?
My husband was an officer
of Her Majesty's army in-
Tell your master
his business with me...
is in my capacity as schoolteacher
to the royal children.
He has no right to pry
into my personal affairs.
No. Well, he hasn't, Captain Orton.
- Oh!
- I don't like that man.
In foreign country,
is best you like everyone until you leave.
Well, you might at least have told us
you speak English, Your Excellency.
Is not necessary for schoolteacher
to know everything at once.
You come with me now.
Your baggages shall be carried to palace later.
Oh, just a minute.
Not the palace.
I am not living in the palace.
- Who say?
- The king say- uh, says.
In his letter of agreement,
he promised me Â£20 a month...
and a house of my own
outside the palace walls.
King do not always remember
what he promise.
Then you will have to remind him.
If I tell king he break this promise,
I will make anger in him.
I think is better if king's anger reserved
for more important matters.
Very well then.
If you are afraid to tell him, I will.
I should like to see him at once,
while there is still time...
for me to return to England,
on this boat if necessary.
King very busy now.
Your Excellency, all I want is
a few minutes' audience with him.
I have come here to work,
and I intend to work...
but I shall take nothing less
than I have been promised.
- You will tell king this.
- I will tell king this.
It should be very interesting meeting.
You come now!
If you wish to change your mind, ma'am-
Good-bye, Captain Orton,
and thank you for everything.
- Good luck, ma'am.
- Good-bye, Captain.
Good-bye, laddie.
Take good care of your mother now.
King in bad spirit today.
Suggest schoolteacher wait
for better day.
My spirit is just as bad, Your Excellency.
I cannot wait.
Man is Lun Tha,
emissary from court of Burma.
He bring present to king
from prince of Burma.
Her name is Tuptim.
What, that girl is a present?
For king.
King is pleased with her.
Sorry. King has concluded audience.
Well, you mean I cannot see him?
Not today.
Louis, come with me.
You cannot do this.
- Your Majesty.
- Who, who, who?
Your Majesty,
is new English schoolteacher...
Mrs. Anna Leonowens, and son.
Louis Leonowens.
You are schoolteacher?
Yes, Your Majesty,
but before I start my work here...
there is one point about our agreement
which I would-
You are part of general plan I have...
for bringing to Siam
what is good in Western culture.
Already I have bring
printing press here for printing.
- Yes, I know, Your Majesty.
- How you know?
Before I signed our agreement...
I found out all I could about
Your Majesty's ambitions for Siam.
Ha.
How old shall you be?
You do not look like scientific person
for teaching of school.
How old shall you be?
I am 150 years old, Your Majesty.
In what year were you "borned"?
In 1712, Your Majesty.
How many years
shall you have been married?
Several, Your Majesty.
How many grandchildren shall you have by now?
How many, now many, now many?
Ha! You do not
answer that so fast.
I make better question
than she make answer. Ha!
You are not afraid of king.
Not to be afraid is good thing
in scientific mind.
I think maybe...
you make very good schoolteaching.
Come!
A few of my wives.
They have beauty,
but not gift for knowledge.
I have no time for teaching, being busy
with foreign affairs and other situations.
Ah, I may present
Lady Thiang, head wife.
There is a happy land
far, far away
Where saints in glory stand
bright, bright as day
In the beginning, God created
the heaven and the Earth.
Missionary.
Oh, a missionary
taught you English.
Oh, yes, sir. Missionary.
I have boy too-
Crown prince Chowfa Chulalongkorn,
heir to throne.
You may help Madam Leonowens
with her schoolteaching...
and she, in her turn,
shall teach you the better English.
She is very grateful to me
for my kindness.
Lady Thiang, have children prepare
for presentation to, uh, schoolteacher.
Uh- Uh, speaking of teaching,
Your Majesty, in our agreement-
Ah, Lady Son Klin,
Lady Talap, Lady Piam...
and this girl is present to me
from Burma prince.
- She just arrived.
- Good day, madam.
My name is Tuptim.
I already speak English.
And very nicely too.
I think I have fine idea.
In addition to children,
you will also teach those of my wives...
as have sense enough for learning.
Siam to be very modern,
scientific country...
everybody speaking the English.
Your Majesty, it is not in our letter of agreement
that I teach your wives too.
Also I will allow you to help me
in my foreign correspondence.
Well, I shall be perfectly happy
to help you in any way I can...
provided we can clear up
this one little matter of the house.
House?
- House? What house?
- Well, my house, Your Majesty-
the one you promised me
adjoining the palace.
It is a pleasure
that you shall live in palace!
You teach in palace,
and you shall live in palace!
Will have nice apartment.
Can look out, see many things.
Oh, yes, I'm sure
we could see many things...
such as iron bars, guards at the doors,
et cetera. et cetera. et cetera.
What is this "et cetera"?
Well, it means...
"and all the rest and so forth,"
Your Majesty.
- 'Ah
- Now you will meet my children.
- I'm very sorry, Your Majesty...
but if there is to be no house, I shall have
to get back to the boat before it sails.
- Come, Louis.
- You will stand here and meet royal children!
Very well, Your Majesty...
but there isn't much time.
The royal princes and princesses.
Ah!
Ah!
Oh!
Well, well, well?
-
-  Ah!
Schoolteacher has graciously changed her mind
and shall live in royal palace.
For the time being,
Your Majesty.
These are the children
you shall teach.
Someday shall allow you
to meet my others.
More, Your Majesty?
Children of wives
not in favor with king-
- uh, 67, I think.
- Oh.
Hmm.
Oh, ladies, please! Please!
No, don't open that. No.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, won't you all go back to your rooms?
Lady Thiang, will you please ask them to leave?
I must have some privacy.
-
- Good heavens!
What are they trying to do to me?
Sir, they think you wear dress like that
because you shaped like that.
Well, I most certainly am not!
-  Oh!
-
They wish to know, sir,
if they may see little boy.
I'm sorry, Lady Thiang.
He is asleep.
Please, do tell me,
why do you keep calling me sir?
Because you scientific,
not lowly like woman.
But do you all think
that women are more lowly than men?
-
-
Well, I certainly do not.
Oh, please, sir, do not tell king.
Make king angry.
Perhaps it's time somebody
did tell him a thing or two.
Please, you have some English books
I can read?
Yes, of course, my dear,
but they're not unpacked yet.
They laugh at her
because she is foolish child.
She has come to live in palace of king,
and yet she is unhappy
Well, after all, she had
no choice in the matter.
Perhaps she is homesick.
Is not homesickness
that make me sad, Mrs. Anna.
- Is love for one I shall never see again.
- Oh, poor child.
- He is Lun Tha,
who was chosen to bring me here.
- Uh-huh.
We tried so hard not to have
love for each other...
but we could not help ourselves.
We did try, Mrs. Anna.
It isn't easy to stop loving a man...
if he's the man you want...
even if you know
you'll never see him again.
I know.
I was very much in love
with my husband.
Please ask them to put that down.
They wish to know, sir,
who is man?
That was my husband, Tom.
Tom.
-  Tom?
- Mm-hmm.
- He was pretty in face.
- Oh, dear.
Yes, he was very pretty in face.
When I think of Tom
I think about a night
When the earth smelled
of summer
And the sky was streaked
with white
And the soft mist of England
was sleeping on a hill,
I remember this
And I always will.
There are new lovers now
on the same silent hill
Looking on the same
blue sea,
And I know Tom and I
are a part of them all,
And they're all a part of Tom
and me}
Hello, young lovers,
whoever you are,
I hope your troubles are few.
All my good wishes
go with you tonight.
I've been in love like you.
Be brave, young lovers,
and follow your star,
Be brave and faithful and true,
Cling very close
to each other tonight.
I've been in love like you.
I know how it feels
to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street
in a trance.
You fly down a street
on the chance that you'll meet,
And you meet
not really by chance.
Don't cry, young lovers
whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone,
All of my mem'ries
are happy tonight,
I've had a love of my own,
I've had a love of my own,
like yours,
I've had a love
of my
own.
'Mid pleasures and palaces
Though we may roam
Be it ever so humble,
There's no place like home.
- Father, I shall be late for school!
- You wait!
You are pleased to recite proverb
you learned yesterday from schoolteacher...
and writing down 12 times
in your Copybook.
A thought for the day:
"East or west, home is best."
"East, west, home, best"
means house!
"A man's house is only less dear to him
than his honor."
Every day, month after week,
something about house!
Are my children to be taught
nothing more?
Yesterday we are taught
that the world is a round ball...
which spins on an invisible stick
through its middle.
Everyone knows that the world rides
on the back of a great turtle...
who keeps it from running
into the stars.
How can it be that everyone knows
one thing...
if many people believe
another thing?
Then which is true?
The world is ball
with stick through it.
- I believe.
- You believe?
Does that mean
that you do not know?
But you must know
because you are king.
Good! Someday you, too,
will be king...
and you, too, will know
everything.
But how do I learn, and when do I know
that I know everything?
When you are king.
When you are king.
But I do not know.
In my head are many facts,
but I am not sure.
What to tell a growing son?
How to bring truth and justice
to my people?
When I was a boy,
World was better spot,
What was so was so,
What was not was not.
Now I am a man,
World have change a lot
Some things nearly so,
Others nearly not.
There are times I almost think
I am not sure
of what I absolutely know.
Very often find confusion
in conclusion
I concluded long ago.
In my head are many facts that,
As a student
I have studied to procure
In my head are many facts,
Of which
I wish I was more certain
I was sure.
Is a puzzlement.
Shall I join with other nations
in alliance?
If allies are weak
am I not best alone?
If allies are strong
with power to protect me,
Might they not protect me
out of all I own?
Is a danger to be trusting
one another,
One will seldom want to do
what other wishes.
But unless someday,
Somebody trust somebody,
There'll be nothing left on earth
excepting fishes!
There are times I almost think
nobody sure of
what he absolutely know,
Ev'rybody find confusion
in conclusion
he concluded long ago.
And it puzzle me to learn
that tho' a man may be in doubt
of what he know,
Very quickly will he fight,
He'll fight to prove
that what he does not know
is so.
Ohhhh!
Sometimes I think
that people going mad!
Ahhhh!
Sometimes I think
that people not so bad.
But no matter what I think,
I must go on living life.
As leader of my kingdom
I must go forth,
Be father to my children,
And husband to each wife,
Et-cet-er-a, et-cet-er-a,
and so forth.
If my Lord in heaven,
Buddha show the way,
Ev'ry day I try to live
another day,
If my Lord in heaven,
Buddha show the way,
Ev'ry day I do my best
for one more day,
But
is a puzzlement.
-
-
-
-
Come along now, children.
Take your places, please.
Quickly now, and quietly.
Lady Thiang, will you start
the lesson, please?
Blue... is ocean.
Red- Siam.
-  Ah!
- Uh-huh.
Here is king of Siam.
In right hand is weapon.
Show how he destroy
all who fight him.
Green- Burma.
Here is king of Burma.
No clothes mean
how poor is king of Burma.
Thank you, Lady Thiang.
I'll continue.
The map you have been looking at
is 25 years old...
and today we have a surprise for you.
Ah!
A new map just arrived
from England.
- I do not see Siam.
- Oh! The white is Siam.
- Siam not so small!
-
Oh, wait.
Let me show you England.
See, it is even smaller than Siam.
Ah!
Before I came here,
Siam was just that little white spot to me.
But now that I've been here many months,
it has become far more to me than that...
because I have met the people of Siam,
and I am learning to understand them.
You like us, Mrs. Anna?
Yes, I like you very much-
- very much indeed.
- Ah!
- Very much indeed.
- Ah!
It's a very ancient saying,
But a true and honest thought,
That if you become a teacher,
By your pupils you'll be taught,
As a teacher
I've been learning
You'll forgive me if I boast
And I've now become an expert,
On the subject I like most,
- Getting to know you.
- Ah!
Getting to know you,
Getting to know all about you.
Getting to like you,
Getting to hope you like me.
Getting to know you,
Putting it my way, but nicely,
You are precisely
My cup of tea!
Getting to know you,
Getting to feel free and easy.
When I am with you,
Getting to know what to say,
Haven't you noticed?
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy
Because of all the beautiful
and new things
I'm learning about you
day
by day. I

Oh, my goodness.
This started out to be a geography lesson.
-
- Quickly, let's get back to work.
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Now-
- What is that green, up there?
That is Norway-
Nor-way.
Nor-way.
Norway is a very cold place.
Sometimes it is so cold...
that the lakes and rivers freeze...
and the water becomes so hard
that you can walk on it.
- Walk on water?
- Yes, walk on water.
How is it possible?
Hard water?
Not only that,
but the raindrops change...
into small white spots
that look like lace...
and this is called snow.
- Snow.
- Spots of lace.
Yes, Your Highness. The water freezes
on its way down from the sky.
I do not believe
such thing as snow!
And I do not believe
such thing as snow.
And I do not believe
Siam is this big.
And other countries so big.
Siam is the biggest country
in the world!
Siam!
How can school be so unscientific?
- Well, Your Majesty,
we had a little misunderstanding.
- Ah.
I was trying to describe snow,
and they refused to believe there is such a thing.
- Snow?
- Snow.
Ah, from mountaintop.
- From the sky, Your Majesty.
- From sky to mountaintop.
-
- That's right, Your Majesty.
I remember.
I see pictures of Switzerland-
land all white with snow.
Who does not believe this?
Well, Your Majesty, after all,
they've never seen it.
Never seen?
If they believe only what they see,
why do we have schoolroom?
Never let me hear
of not believing schoolteacher...
whom I have bring here
at high expense-
- twenty pounds each month.
-
Twenty English pounds...
sterling!
Rise!
I command all of you
to make most of this opportunity...
for expensive education...
for sake of selves and country.
Furthermore, it is, uh-
What, what, what?
This is not study book I have provide.
No, Your Majesty, it's one of mine.
I gave it to Tuptim.
- The name-you tell me.
- Is call The Small House of Uncle Thomas.
Is by American lady,
Harriet Beecher Stowe.
A woman has written a book?
Uncle Tom's Cabin--
a wonderful book, Your Majesty...
all about the evils of slavery
in America.
Now, President "Lingkong" of America
against slavery, no?
- Very definitely, Your Majesty.
- Me too.
Slavery very bad thing.
Mr. Lincoln is fighting a war even now
to set the slaves free.
You admire him for this?
Very much, Your Majesty.
He seems to be a fine man who has
studied hard and educated himself.
In that, he is not unlike yourself.
Ha.
Now, shall "Mr. Lingkong" be winning
this war he's fighting at present?
Well, no one knows really.
Well, does he have enough guns
and elephants for transporting same?
I don't think they have elephants
in America, Your Majesty.
- No elephants?
- No.
No wonder
he is not winning war!
All right, children,
you may be seated now.
- Mrs. Anna?
- Yes, Your Highness?
I do not understand...
how slaves can be set free
if their masters wish to keep them.
It is done by the passing of a law,
Your Highness...
and by the enforcing of that law,
if necessary.
But my slaves
and the slaves of my father-
Suppose there was such a law in Siam,
and we did not want it so.
Sometimes things can't be just a question
of what we want, Your Highness...
but of what is right.
Huh.
I think perhaps we had better call recess now
until after luncheon.
- You may be excused.
- Yea!
Young prince has healthy respect
for ways of his own people-
sometimes more than king.
Prince Chulalongkorn is a fine boy
with a keen and probing mind...
but he still has much to learn,
Your Excellency.
What is important for him to learn...
I do not think he will find
in this classroom.
I am fully aware that you do not approve
of my coming to Siam, Your Excellency.
Why are you so blind?
Have you no eyes to see?
King tries impossible task...
wishing to be scientific man
who learn all modern things.
I think it a fine ambition.
Inside himself is strong king,
like his father was, who cannot change.
He will only tear himself in two,
trying to be something he can never be.
Of course he can never be, if those
closest to him are unwilling to help him.
You do not know king
as well as you think you do.
You believe you have
great influence over him.
You will end up as his slave,
like all the others.
I--
Oh.
Yes, yes.just a moment.
The king, at this hour of the night?
-
-
Well, I trust His Majesty won't object
if I put some clothes on first.
Oh.
Oh.
You sent for me, Your Majesty?
Your Majesty.
Oh, Your Majesty is reading the Bible.
Ah, Mrs. Anna.
I think your Moses
shall have been a fool.
- Moses?
- Moses, Moses, Moses.
I think he shall have been a fool.
Here it stands written by him...
that the world was created
in six days.
Now, you know and I know
that it took many ages to create world.
I think he shall have been a fool
to have written so.
What is your opinion?
Is that why Your Majesty sent for me
at this hour of the night?
That is not reason,
but first I wish to discuss Moses.
Now, how am I ever to learn truth...
if different English books
state different things?
Your Majesty, the Bible was not written
by men of science, but by men of faith.
It was their explanation
of the miracle of creation...
which is the same miracle
whether it took six days or many centuries.
Huh.
I still think your Moses
shall have been a fool.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
Now, was there something else?
Take letter.
A letter? Now?
Now. When else?
Now is always best time.
Take letter to "Mr. Lingkong" of America,
who is very scientific ruler.
-
- Very well, Your Majesty.
Uh, from Phra Mana Mongkut...
by the blessing
of the highest superagency...
in the world of the whole universe...
the king of Siam...
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera-
Do you not have any respect for me?
I cannot stand all the time...
and in this country,
no one's head shall be higher than king's.
From now on, in presence,
you shall so conduct like all other subjects.
- You mean, on the floor?
- All subjects do so.
I am very sorry.
I shall try my best not to let my head
be higher than Your Majesty's...
but I simply cannot grovel
on the floor.
I couldn't possibly work that way
or think.
You are very difficult woman!
Perhaps so, Your Majesty.
But you'll observe care
that head shall never be higher than mine.
When I shall sit, you shall sit!
When I shall kneel, you shall kneel...
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera!
Very well, Your Majesty.
Is promise?
Is promise.
Good.
To his royal presidency
of the United States in America...
"Abrahom Lingkong"...
um, et cetera- You fix up.
It has occurred to us-
You see, it has occurred to us-
It has occurred to us
that if we shall be sending you...
several pairs
of young male elephants...
to be turned loose
in forest of America-
"A-mer-i-ca"-
we are of opinion...
that after a while,
they shall increase in number...
- and inhabitants of America shall be able to-
-
- Your Majesty.
- Well?
I don't think you mean
pairs of male elephants.
How can I make letter
if you interrupt?
And inhabitants of America shall be able
to catch and tame them...
and use them as beasts of burden.
Only male elephants, Your Majesty?
You put in the details.
Good night.
Moses. Lincoln. Elephants!
- Groveling on the floor at 2:00 in the morning.
- Ma'am. Ma'am!
I am Lun Tha.
You are Mrs. Anna, schoolteacher?
Yes, but you shouldn't be-
I must meet with Tuptim again.
Please!
You have been seeing her here?
Twice we have spoken.
Each time it becomes more difficult.
She has said you are friend
who will help us.
Oh, no, I couldn't.
It's much too dangerous-
not for me, but for Tuptim and you.
You would be killed if they find you here
in the City of women.
Death is not worse pain
than empty life.
Please, Mrs. Anna.
I'm sorry, Lun Tha.
There's nothing I can do.
Wait there.
Tuptim.
Oh, Lun Tha.
Seeing you this way is not enough.
There is nothing we can do.
I am watched too closely.
I am watched too closely.
Must we go on forever
hiding our love like this?
We kiss in a shadow
We hide from the moon,
Our meetings are few
and over too soon.
We speak in a whisper,
Afraid to be heard
Alone in our secret,
Together we sigh
for one smiling day
to be free,
To kiss in the sunlight,
Behold and believe what you see!
Behold how my lover
loves me!
When will we be together,
Tuptim? When?
It can never be, Lun Tha-
not ever.
To kiss in the sunlight
And say to the sky:
Behold and believe
what you see!
Behold
how my lover
loves
me!
You must go now.
I will be missed, and they will start
searching for me.
When I return,
it will be to take you from here.
There is no way, Lun Tha.
There is a river.
There are boats.
I will find a way.
- Oh, if it could only be.
- It will be. I swear this.
When all is arranged,
I will get word to you.
I shall pray, Lun Tha.
If you see a chaba flower
in your path, broken like this...
it will be the sign
that I have come for you.
- Watch for it.
- I will be ready.
Stop, stop, stop!
Aah!
- Your Majesty.
- What, what, what?
Well?
When Siam's richest province
was stolen by France last year...
I warned it was not end,
but only beginning of Western treachery.
If enemies of our kingdom,
with lies such as this...
can convince British
that you are unfit to be ruler of Siam...
our seas will soon be thick with ships
greedy for conquest.
So it has finally come.
We must act quickly.
But how? Where?
I must think clearly,
scientifically.
-
- I must think.
- But how can I think
while being driven out of mind?
-
A charm from the skies
seems to hallow us there,
Which seek through the world,
Is ne'er met with else where.
That was splendid.
Very effective!
Now-
Oh, good morning, Your Majesty.
You think you teach king lesson...
but this is one lesson
you do not be paid for teaching.
In future you will stop instructing
wives and children...
in silly English song,
"Home, Sweet House"...
in order to remind me
of breaking promises I never make...
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Your Majesty, I do not intend
to have my boy brought up in a harem.
And you did promise me a house-
"a brick residence
adjoining the palace."
Those were your very words
in the letter.
- I do not remember such words.
- I remember them.
I will do remembering!
Who is king here?
I remind you,
so you remember that!
I do not remember
any promises.
I do not remember anything
except that you are my servant!
- Oh, no, Your Majesty.
- What, what, what?
I said you are my servant!
No, that is not true.
I am most certainly not your servant.
And what is more, if you do not give me
the house you promised...
I shall be forced to return to England
immediately.
-
- Please, Mrs. Anna. Do not go to England!
Don't go, teacher!
- I believe in snow.
- Do not let her go away.
I let her do nothing
that is not my pleasure.
It is my pleasure
that you stay here...
in palace, in palace!
- No, Your Majesty.
-
Why do you wish
to leave these children...
all of whom are loving you
so extraordinarily?
I do not wish to leave them.
I love them, too,
quite extraordinarily.
But I cannot stay in a country
where a promise has no meaning-
I will hear no more
about this promise.
A land where there is talk of honor...
and a wish for Siam to take her place
amongst the modern nations of the world...
where there is talk
of great changes...
but where everything still remains
according to the wishes of the king.
You will say no more!
No more!
I will say no more
because there is no more to say!
- Come, Louis.
- No, please, Mrs. Anna! Please!
Out, out, out!
-
-
- Who is it?
-
Oh. Well, come in, Lady Thiang.
Mrs. Anna, you must go to king at once.
Indeed. And why must I?
My work here is finished.
I plan to leave on the next sailing.
- Please, Mrs. Anna.
- Did he send you here to ask me?
No. It is I who ask you.
King is in terrible distress,
not knowing where to turn.
Distress?
Agents in Singapore have found
copies of letters to British government...
which describe king as barbarian...
and suggest necessity
of making Siam a protectorate.
Oh, but that is outrageous.
The king is many things I dislike,
but he is not a barbarian.
- Then you will go to him now?
- You mean, to advise him?
It must not sound like advice.
King cannot take advice.
And he will not bring up subject.
You must do it for him.
No, Lady Thiang, I can't.
It's against all my principles.
He needs help, Mrs. Anna.
Oh, but he has you.
I am not equal
to his special needs.
Oh, please, Lady Thiang,
I simply cannot go to him...
especially without
his having asked for me.
What more can I say to you?
This is a man
who thinks with his heart,
His heart is not always wise.
This is a man
who stumbles and falls,
But this is a man
who tries.
This is a man
you'll forgive and forgive,
and help and protect,
as long
as you live.
He will not always say
What you would have him say,
But now and then he'll say
something
wonderful
The thoughtless things he'll do
will hurt and worry you.
Then all at once he'll do
something
wonderful.
You know that he believes in them,
And that's enough
for you.
You'll always go along,
Defend him when he's wrong,
He is wonderful.
He'll always need
your love,
And so he'll get
your love.
can be
wonderful.
- Your Majesty.
- Ah! You have come to apologize.
- I am sorry, Your Majesty, but I did not-
- Good. You apologize.
- I didn't say-
- I accept.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Well? Do you not see I am occupied?
My mind on very important matters.
Anything you wish
to discuss with me?
Why should I discuss important matter
with woman?
Very well, Your Majesty.
In that case, I shall say good night.
Good night!
- Your Majesty?
- Ah! What, what, what?
I was wondering, when the boat arrived
from Singapore today-
- Singapore! Ah!
- was there any news from abroad?
News. There were news.
- They call me barbarian!
- Who?
Certain parties who would use this
as excuse to steal my country.
Suppose you are Queen Victoria,
and someone say to you king of Siam is barbarian.
- Do you believe?
- Well, Your Majesty-
You will, you will, you will
believe I am barbarian...
because there is no one
to speak otherwise.
Oh, but this is a lie.
It is a false lie!
What have you decided
to do about it?
You guess.
Well, if someone were sending a big lie
about me to England...
I would do my best to send the truth
to England.
Is that what you have decided to do,
Your Majesty?
Yes, that is what I have decided to do,
but how?
Guess howl shall do this.
Well, my guess would be
that you would seek...
some kind of personal contact
with the British.
- Ah! Personal contact.
- Mm-hmm.
- When British ambassador
and party arrive in Siam-
- The ambassador is coming here?
On quick tour of Orient.
Friendship tour, they say.
I receive letters from his aide,
Sir Edward Ramsey...
who accompanies him.
Edward? Coming here?
" Edward."
You call him this?
Oh, we are old friends,
Your Majesty.
I knew him in London
before I was married.
I knew him in London
before I was married.
Hmm.
When they are here,
I shall take opportunity...
of expressing my opinion of English thieves
who would try to steal my country.
I will show them who is barbarian!
Well, what is this face you put on?
Well, Your Majesty, my guess is that you will
not fight with your distinguished visitors.
- I will not?
- No, Your Majesty.
You will give a banquet
in their honor.
You will entertain them
in a particularly grand manner.
In this way, you will make them
all witnesses in your favor.
They will return to England
and report to the queen...
that you are most certainly
not a barbarian.
Naturally!
Ha!
Naturally! This is what
I shall have intended to do.
That's it, Your Majesty.
Stand up to them.
Put your best foot forward.
O-Oh, no. It's an expression,
Your Majesty.
It means, put on your best clothes...
show them your most intelligent men
and your most beautiful women.
But shall it be proper for the British dignitary
to see my women...
without shoes on their feet?
Shall it be proper for my women to put
their best, uh, bare feet forward?
-
- No! We shall make them look
like ladies of Europe.
Shoes on feet.
Dresses on bodies.
You will tell me which of my ladies are
most like Europeans for dressing like same.
You will educate them in European customs
and manner for presentation.
- Also, sew dresses.
- Sew dresses?
All women in kingdom shall help.
Your Majesty, don't you think
it would make a better impression...
if your women received
in their own manner and dress?
Mrs. Anna, you are not being scientific.
The British ambassador knows
we're Siamese.
I wish him to know we're also Europeans.
Wake up!
Everybody, to the temple!
Wake up! Wake up, wives!
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
We will entertain them
with acrobats and jugglers.
Oh, Your Majesty! We could give them
a theatrical performance.
Tuptim has written a play
for the royal dancers-
her own version
of Uncle Tom's Cabin.
We shall give them theatricals.
We shall show them who is barbarian.
We could have the steward make
some European dishes for dinner.
Good. You teach. To be served
on very high table, with chairs.
- Long, white tablecloth.
- And napkins.
Of finest silk.
Using best gold chopsticks.
Chopsticks? Don't you think knives and forks
would be more suitable?
I make mistake. British not scientific enough
for the use of chopsticks.
You are to order finest gold knives
and forks in kingdom.
Also spoons.
Why do you not think of spoons?
An inspired idea, Your Majesty.
We mustn't forget cigars.
Englishmen are very fond of cigars.
We get best. You are to make list of all eminent
Europeans residing in Bangkok...
for sending of invitations to same.
Very well, Your Majesty.
Also you will instruct court musicians
their learning music of Europe for dancing...
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Excellent, Your Majesty.
Now, how much time do I have for all this?
British gunboat last reported off Singkla.
This gives you... one week.
One week!
Your Majesty, one week?
In this same time,
whole world was created.
Moses say!
First we shall ask help
from Buddha.
Bow to him.
Bow, bow, bow.
Bow!
Oh, Buddha,
give us the aid of your strength...
and your wisdom.
- Oh, Buddha, give us the aid
of your strength and your wisdom.
-
And help us to prove
to the visiting English...
that we are extraordinary
and remarkable people.
- And help us to prove to the visiting English...
-
That we are extraordinary
and remarkable people.
Ah-ha, ha-ha
Help also Mrs. Anna to keep awake...
for scientific sewing of dresses...
even though she be
only a woman and a Christian...
and therefore unworthy
of your interest.
- Help also Mrs. Anna to keep awake-
- Oh!
- Your Majesty, this is really-
- A promise is a promise.
- Head must not be higher than mine!
- Oh!
A promise!
...and therefore unworthy of your interest.
And, Buddha...
I promise you...
that I shall give
this unworthy woman-
a house.
We will build her
a house of her own-
a brick residence...
adjoining royal palace...
according to agreement...
et cetera...
et cetera...
et cetera.
- And, Buddha, I promise you-
- Your Majesty.
- That I shall give this unworthy woman-
- Oh!
A house.
We will build her
a house of her own-
a brick residence
adjoining royal palace...
according to agreement.
Et cetera
Et cetera
Ah!
Et cetera
The napkins finally arrived.
Thank heavens.
Would you place them on the table,
please, Lady Thiang?
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
Now, are we all prepared?
The guests are arriving.
Please, Mrs. Anna,
do not let Englishmen come here.
- We are afraid.
- They cast terrible spell on us with evil eye!
- Please, Mrs. Anna.
- Oh, nonsense! Nonsense.
Now, step back, ladies.
Let me see how you look.
Stand apart.
Very nice.
Now, turn round.
Ah!
- Oh, my goodness gracious!
- What shall be trouble now?
I forgot! They have practically
no undergarments.
Undergarments? Of what importance
are undergarments at this time?
- Of great importance.
- Are you wearing undergarments?
All properly dressed English ladies
always wear undergarments.
I have opinion that, in this regard,
England is very backward nation.
Ooh!
- Is this what you shall be wearing tonight?
- Why, yes.
Do you like it?
Well, are you certain
this is customary?
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
What is so extraordinary about bare shoulders?
Your own ladies-
Ah, yes, but is different...
because of not wearing so many covering ups
on other parts of body...
and, uh, therefore, the-
Therefore what?
Is different.
I'm sorry Your Majesty
does not approve.
- I have not said I do not approve.
-
- I have not said I do not approve.
-
The ambassador and his party
must be arriving, Your Majesty.
- Ah!
- Mrs. Anna, they are Cannibals!
They will eat us!
They will eat us!
They will do nothing of the kind.
Now, ladies, remember,
when you are presented to the ambassador...
for heaven's sake,
keep your backs to the wall.
- So!
- Your Majesty.
This shall be His Excellency,
Sir John Hay...
most honorable representative
of United Kingdom in Great Britain.
- Your Majesty.
- I am pleased.
- Cigar?
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
And may I introduce my aide,
Sir Edward Ramsey?
- Your Majesty?
- Ah. I am pleased. Cigar.
- Thank you.
- Ah!
And this is Madam Leonowens, teacher
of English language, customs, et cetera...
in royal household.
We've heard of your splendid work here,
Mrs. Leonowens.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Edward, it's so good to see you.
- How are you, Anna?
Come with me.
Meet royal wives.
- Royal wives.
-
- He has the head of a goat!
-
-
- Evil eye!
Ladies! Ladies! Come back. Come back.
Oh, dear!
Oh, Your Majesty, this is dreadful.
Why have you not educated those girls
in the British custom...
of spying glass?
Is that what started the panic?
I regret, sir, my ladies have not given
good impression.
On the contrary, Your Majesty.
I dare say His Excellency and I have rarely
received so good an impression...
in so short a time.
- Ah.
- Anna, you have most attractive pupils.
- Ah.
- Anna, you have most attractive pupils.
Oh, I wish you could see the smaller ones-
His Majesty's children-
but unfortunately,
they're asleep now.
How many children do you have,
Your Majesty?
I have only 106.
I am not married very long.
Oh, next month expecting five more.
Anna, my dear.
You're looking lovelier than ever.
I was rather hoping to find you
wasted away with homesickness.
For England?
I have no one there, Edward.
- Not anymore.
- No one, Anna?
-
- Hear that?
We danced to that once.
Richmond. Remember?
- Mm-hmm.
- Still dance?
- Not very often.
- You should.
Do you also remember
I once asked you to marry me?
Of course.
I never allowed Tom to forget it.
And I never learned to take defeat
like a gentleman.
Dear Edward.
I didn't come to Bangkok
just because I enjoy sleeping on a gunboat...
or watching Sir John comb his beard.
-
- Anna, Anna.
You're much too young
to bury your heart in a grave.
Oh, but it's not buried.
It's very much alive.
- Here?
- Yes.
Among people who need me...
people I can help.
You could help me very much, Anna.
I see another 10 years of waiting
in those eyes.
Dancing after dinner!
I'm afraid I just couldn't resist
talking over old times.
I had impression
Mrs. Anna would be of help...
for seating of guests
at dinner table...
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
Now it is too late!
They all stand up, waiting.
In that case,
we'd better be going in, Anna.
Yes. We better be going in.
An-na!
Ah! I forget.
If youâll excuse me,
Your Majesty.
Ha.
Now, herewith shall be list of subjects
you try to bring up for talk.
On such subjects I am very brilliant...
and will make great impression.
You begin with Moses.
Bow.
Ah.
Eat, eat, eat!
His Majesty made a rather interesting point
about Moses the other day...
when he was reading the Bible.
Oh. yes!
Moses is very fine illustration...
of little-known fact
that men of faith...
and men of science...
by contradicting each other...
always manage to arrive
at same conclusion.
I shall explain.
I should like to propose a toast.
- His Gracious Majesty, the king of Siam.
- Ah.
May the rest of the world
always regard him...
with the same high esteem...
as does the government of Her Majesty,
Queen Victoria.
Hear! Hear!
Your Majesty.
More toast.
To Her Gracious Majesty Victoria...
queen of United Kingdom and Ireland...
powerful sovereign of British colonies
around globe of human world...
I wish to say "warm affection."
- To the queen!
- To the queen.
Enough toast for queen. Sit.
-
- Now, theatricals for entertainment.
Tonight, play written by member
of royal palace as surprise for king.
Siamese version
of famous American book.
Your Majesty...
and honorable guests...
We begin to put before you
"Small House of Uncle Thomas."
Small house of Uncle Thomas,
ruled by most wicked king
in all of America...
Your Majesty, I beg to put before you
loving friends.
Your Majesty, I beg to put before you
loving friends.
- Uncle Thomas.
-  Dear old Uncle Thomas.
- Little Eva.
-  Blessed little Eva.
- Little Topsy.
-  Mischief maker, Topsy.
- Happy people.
-  Very happy people.
I beg to put before you
one who is not happy-
Eliza's lord and master,
King Simon of Legree.
to faraway province
of "O-hee-o."
- Lover's name is George.
-  George
Baby in her arms
also called George.
Eliza say she run away
and look for lover, George.
- Eliza lose her way in forest.
-  Hide in forest
Poor Eliza
Poor Eliza Poor Eliza
-  Poor Eliza
-  Poor Eliza.
Your Majesty,
I regret to put before you...
Your Majesty,
I regret to put before you...
King Simon of Legree.
Because one slave has run away
Simon beating ev'ry slave.
and thereby discover
all who run from king.
Run, Eliza, run.
Run Eliza
Run, Run
Run from Simon
Run, run
Run Eliza
Run from Simon
Eliza Run

Eliza run from Simon
Run
Run Eliza
Run from Simon
Run Eliza
Run from Simon
Run Eliza, run, run
Run
-
- Who can save her?
Only Buddha
Save her, Buddha, save her.
Buddy make a miracle.
Buddha make a miracle.
Send from heaven
stars and blossoms.
Snow.
Of a sudden, she can see
wicked Simon of Legree...
sliding cross the river fast
with his bloodhound and his slaves!
mischief maker Topsy
and faithful lover George...
Topsy glad that Simon die.
Topsy dance for joy!
I tell you what
Harriet Beecher "Stowa" say...
that Topsy say.
"I 'spects I's de wickedest critter
in de world."
Topsy is wicked critter...
because I, too, am glad
for death of king-
of any king who pursue
a slave who is unhappy...
and who try to escape.
And Your Majesty,
I wish to say to you--
I beg of you-
Your Majesty...
and honorable guests...
I will tell you end of story.
Poor little Eva
- that Eva come to him...
-  Poor little Eva
- and thank him personally...
-  Poor little Eva
- for saving of Eliza and baby.
-  Poor unfortunate
, ''
Very clever.
Very clever, Your Majesty!
Author! Author!
Author! Author!
-
-
Ah.
- Ah!
- Will there be anything else
before I say good night?
Sit, sit, sit.
Plenty for two. Eat.
Oh! Oh, no, thank you.
Fork is a foolhardy instrument.
- You pick up food, and it leaks.
-
Oh, your conversation at dinner
was most amusing, Your Majesty.
Ha! I was forced to laugh myself.
I was so funny!
Before leaving, Edward confided to me
that the ambassador...
was quite impressed.
Edward.
And he will most certainly send
a glowing report to Queen Victoria.
I am so pleased, Your Majesty.
I am aware of your interest.
I wish to say...
you have been of great help to me
in this endeavor.
I wish to make gift.
I have hope you accept.
Put it on. Put it on finger.
Oh, put it on, put it on, put it on.
Your Majesty, I-
I don't know what to say.
When one does not know
what to say...
it is a time to be silent.
It is getting late, Your Majesty,
and if there is nothing else-
There is, there is, there is else.
Uh, have good news to tell.
Yesterday, a white elephant
has been discovered...
in forest of Ayuthia.
- I gather you regard this as a good omen.
- Yes. Very good omen.
Everything going well with us.
Yes. Everything going well with us.
Tuptim.Your pupil!
Her play tonight.
Oh, but, Your Majesty,
everyone enjoyed it immensely.
It is immoral for king to drown
when pursuing slave who deceive him!
Immoral, immoral!
Tuptim shall hear of my displeasure
when she's found.
Found?
It is believed she hides
somewhere in palace...
to escape king's anger and, uh-
You know something of this.
- Only that she has been unhappy.
- Why unhappy?
She is in palace of king!
What is greater honor for young girl...
than to be in palace of king?
Oh, but, Your Majesty, of what interest to you
is one girl like Tuptim?
In your household,
she is just another woman...
as a bowl of rice
is just another bowl of rice...
no different from
any other bowl of rice.
Now you understand about women.
So many English books I read
introduce strange idea...
of love, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.
- Ha!
- You disapprove?
But it is a silly complication
of a pleasant simplicity.
A woman is designed for pleasing man.
That is all.
A man is designed to be pleased
by many women.
Then how do you explain the fact,
Your Majesty...
that many men remain faithful
to one wife?
- They're sick.
-
- But you do expect women to be faithful.
- Naturally.
- Well, why "naturally"?
- Because it is natural.
It is like old Siamese rhyme.
It is like old Siamese rhyme.
A girl must be like a blossom...
with honey for just one man.
A man must live like honeybee...
and gather all he can.
To fly from blossom to blossom,
A honeybee must be free,
But blossom must not ever fly...
from bee, to bee, to bee.
Oh, Your Majesty.
Oh, Your Majesty.
In my country, we have
a far different attitude.
We believe that,
for a man to be truly happy...
he must love one woman
and one woman only.
This idea was invented by woman.
Oh, but it's a beautiful idea,
Your Majesty...
and in England,
we're brought up with it.
And by the time a young girl goes
to her first dance-
Young girl?
They dance also?
Like I see tonight,
in arms of man not her husband?
- Why, of course.
- I would not permit.
Oh, but it's very exciting...
when you're young,
at your first dance...
and you're sitting on a small gilt chair
with your eyes lowered...
And suddenly you see two black shoes...
a white waistcoat...
a face.
It speaks.
It speaks.
We've just be introduced,
I do not know you well.
But when the music started,
something drew me
to your side.
So many men and girls
It made me think
we might be
similarly occupied.
Shall we dance?
On a bright cloud of music
shall we fly?
Shall we dance?
Shall we then say "good-night"
and mean "good-bye?"
Oh, perchance
when the last little star
has left the sky.
Shall we still be together
with our arms around each other,
And shall you be my new romance?
On the clear understanding
that this kind of thing can happen,
Shall we dance?
Shall we dance?
Shall we dance?
Why do you stop? You dance pretty.
Go on, go on, go on.
Oh, Your Majesty, I didn't realize.
After all, I'm not a dancing girl.
In England, no woman would dance alone
while a man is looking at her.
But she will dance with strange man,
holding hands, et cetera.
Yes, but not always a stranger.
Usually a very good friend.
Good. Then we'll dance together.
You show me.
- Teach, teach, teach!
- Well, it's quite simple, the polka.
You count, "One, two, three, and one, two, three,
and one, two, three, and"-
You count, "One, two, three, and one, two, three,
and one, two, three, and"--
-  Shall we dance?
- One, two, three, and--
On a bright cloud of music
-  shall we fly?
- One, two, three, and--
-  Shall we dance?
- One, two, three, and--
-  Shall we then say "good-night"
and mean "good-bye?"
- One, two, three, and--
Oh, perchance
when the last little star
has left the sky,
Shall we still be together
with our arms around each other,
-  And shall you be my new romance?
-  Romance
On the clear understanding
that this kind of thing can happen,
Shall we dance? Shall we dance?
Shall we dance?
- Now, one, two, three, and one, two, three...
- One, two, three.
- and one, two three.
- One, two, three. One, two--
Something wrong. I know! I forget "and."
Next time I remember.
One, two, three, and one, two, three...
- and one, two--
- That's splendid, Your Majesty!
Splendid! Splendid!
You throw me off count!
And one, two, three, and one, two, three,
and one, two, three--
- That is not right.
- Oh, yes, it is.
- You were doing beautifully, Your Majesty.
- No, no.
Not the way I see
Europeans dancing tonight.
Yes, it was.
It was just like that.
Were not holding
two hands like this.
No...
as a matter of fact.
Was, uh...
like this...
no?
- Yes.
- Come!
Come.
We do it again.
- Your Majesty.
- Why do you burst in here without waiting?
We have found Tuptim.
- Where is she?
- Secret police are questioning her.
- Her lover has not been caught-- not yet.
- What?
It is believed she was running away
with Lun Tha...
man who bring her here
from Burma.
Dishonor.
Dishonor, dishonor!
- Bring her in!
- But, Your Majesty, what will you do with her?
- I shall do what is usually done in such event.
-
No! Mrs. Anna! Do not let them beat me!
Do not let them!
-
-
- Where is this man?
- I do not know.
It is known you were lovers
with this man.
- I was not lovers with this man!
- Dishonor.
Will have truth of you!
Stop that! Do you hear me?
Stop it!
It is better if you understand at once...
that this matter does not
concern you.
Oh, but it does, Your Majesty.
It does dreadfully because of her,
and even more, because of you.
She's only a child running away
because she was unhappy.
- Can't you understand that?
- You waste my time!
Oh, Your Majesty, I beg of you
not to take revenge on this girl.
If you do, you will be throwing away
everything good you have accomplished...
for yourself and your country.
This girl hurt your vanity. That is all.
She didn't hurt your heart.
You have no heart! You've never loved anyone,
and you never will.
I will show you! Give me.
I cannot believe you are going to do
this dreadful thing!
You don't believe, huh? Maybe you believe when
you hear her screaming as you run from here.
I am not going to run.
I am going to stand here and watch you.
Hold this girl.
I do this myself!
- You  a barbarian!
- Down, down, down!
Am I king
or am I not king?
Am I to be cuckold
in my own palace?
Am I to take orders
from English schoolteacher?
- No, no. Not orders!
- Silence!
I am king,
as I was born to be...
and Siam to be governed
in my way!
Not English way, not French way,
not Chinese way!
My way!
Barbarian, you say?
There is no barbarian
worse than a weak king.
And I am strong, do you hear?
- Strong!
-
- Well?
- The man, the lover, has been found in river.
- He is dead.
-
Dead? Oh, no!
- Aah!
-  Oh, no!
Oh, no!
I don't understand you--
not you or your king.
- I'll never understand him.
- You--
When I warn you of this many months ago,
you do not listen.
- You have destroyed him.
- Oh.
He can never be the king
that he was before.
You have taken all that away from him.
You have destroyed king!
The next boat that comes here, no matter
where it goes, I shall be on it.
Give this back to His Majesty.
I wish you have never come to Siam!
So do I! Oh, so do I!
Getting to know you
-  My cup of tea!
-  Mother!
Mother, our luggage is all loaded.
We'll be late for the boat.
Yes, Louis. I'm coming.
- Mrs. Anna.
-
Your Highness, how nice of you
to come to say good-bye.
Mrs. Anna,
I do not come for myself.
I come for one
who must see you quickly.
You may tell His Majesty
I am no longer subject to his commands.
You do not understand.
Mrs. Anna, he is dying.
Dying? The king?
Oh, no, Lady Thiang.
What-- What happened?
Who can say what it is
that makes a man die?
A sad heart that no longer wishes
to go on beating?
Ever since night of great banquet...
he has shut himself away
in palace...
turning from all
who would speak to him...
unwilling to sleep
or to nourish himself...
searching through many books,
only to push them aside in despair.
Doctors warned him
he must change his ways quickly...
but he would not listen,
Mrs. Anna.
He would not listen.
I had no idea.
Everyone who knew was
forbidden to speak of it.
And now doctors have
no hope for him.
-
- I am frightened, Mrs. Anna.
I am frightened
because I love my father...
and also because if he dies,
I shall be king...
and I do not know how to be.
Oh.
Many men learn this after they
become kings, Your Highness.
It will be good to think back...
on all that Mrs. Anna has taught you.
When king heard you were sailing tonight,
he started to write letter.
It was difficult for him,
Mrs. Anna.
Very difficult.
He has commanded
that I give it to you.
Please, may I hear what my father has said,
Mrs. Anna?
"While I am lying here...
"I think, perhaps, I die.
"This heart, which you say
I have not got...
"is matter of concern.
"It occurs to me
that there shall be nothing wrong...
"that men shall die...
"for all that matters about man...
"is that he shall have tried
his utmost best.
"In looking back,
I discover that you think much...
"who require that you live up
to best of self.
"You have spoken truth
to me always...
"and for this I have often
lost my temper on you.
"But now I do not wish to die...
"without saying this gratitude...
"and large respect...
"et cetera, et cetera.
"I think it very strange
that a woman...
"shall have been
most earnest help of all.
"But, Mrs. Anna,
you must remember...
"that you have been
a very difficult woman...
and much more difficult
than generality."
We must hurry back now.
You will come?
Mother, now that the king is dying...
does that make you friends again?
I suppose so, Louis.
We can't hurt each other anymore.
He always frightened me.
I wish you had known him better.
You two could have been
such good friends.
In many ways, he was just as young as you.
Was he as good a king
as he could have been?
I don't think any man has ever been
as good a king...
as he could have been.
But this one tried.
He tried very hard.
You really like him,
don't you, Mother?
Yes, Louis.
I like him very much.
Very much indeed.
Several weeks I do not see you,
Mrs. Anna.
And now I die.
Oh, no, Your Majesty.
This is not scientific.
I know if I die or do not die.
You shouldn't be here.
Can't we move you to your room?
No.
I wish to remain here
in room with knowledge.
You are leaving Siam?
- When?
- Very soon, Your Majesty.
In fact, I can stay
only a few more minutes.
And you are glad of this?
People of Siam--
royal children, et cetera--
are not glad.
And all are in great affliction...
of your departure.
I shall miss them.
You shall miss them,
but you shall be leaving.
I, too, am leaving...
only I'm not walking onto a boat
with my own feet...
of my own free will.
I am just leaving.
Why is your head higher than mine?
Here.
Here is something
belonging to you.
Put it on.
Put it on, put it on!
Please, wear it.
The children.
Let my children come in.
Good evening, children.
Good evening, my father.
- Please, Mrs. Anna, do not go!
-
Children, stop this noise.
Did you come to see your father
or Mrs. Anna?
It is all right, Lady Thiang.
It is suitable.
It is suitable.
My father?
Princess Ying Yaowalak?
I have wish to--
She has memorized message
for Mrs. Anna.
Speak message now.
Dear friend and teacher...
my goodness gracious...
do not go away.
We are in great need of you.
Continue good and sincere concern...
for us...
and lead us in right road.
Your loving pupil...
Princess Ying Yaowalak.
Mother, it's the boat.
- It's time to go.
- Do not go, Mrs. Anna!
- Please do not go!
- No, no, Mrs. Anna!
Louis, run down to the boat and ask Captain
Orton to take our things off and send them back.
Silence!
There is no reason
for doing of demonstration...
for schoolteacher
realizing her duty...
for which I pay her
exorbitant monthly fee...
of, uh--
of Â£25.
-  Ooh!
this is disorganized behavior...
in presence of dying king.
Chulalongkorn.
Rise.
Mrs. Anna...
you take notes.
You take notes...
from next king.
Well, suppose you are king.
Is there nothing you would do?
I--I would make proclamations.
Yes? Yes?
First, I would proclaim
for coming New Year, fireworks.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Also boat races.
Boat races?
Why boat races
with New Year's celebration?
I like boat races.
And, Father, I would make
second proclamation.
Yes, what is second proclamation?
Make it, make it.
Regarding custom of bowing to king...
in fashion of lowly toad...
I do not believe
this is good thing...
causing embarrassing fatigue of body...
degrading experience for soul...
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
This is bad thing...
I... believe.
You are angry at me, my father?
Oh, why do you ask question?
If you are king...
you are
Do not ask question of sick man...
nor of woman.
This proclamation...
against bowing to king...
I believe to be your fault.
Oh, I hope so, Your Majesty.
I do hope so.
Up! Rise up.
Father?
Up, up, up.
Like soldiers, into lines.
It has been said.
There shall be no more bowing...
for showing
for king.
It has been said by one...
who has been trained...
for royal government.
There shall be no bowing like toad.
No crouching, no crawling.
This does not mean, however...
that you do not show respect for king.
-
-
You will face king
with proud expression...
showing pride in self
as well as in king.
This is proper way for men
to show esteem for one another-
This is proper way for men
to show esteem for one another--
by looking upon each other's faces...
with calmness of spirit...
eyes meeting eyes in equal gaze...
bodies upright, standing as men
were meant to stand-
-
So, from this day forward--
