Can you turn the radio down?
We've been on a train for 12 hours.
We're exhausted.
Twelve? Where from?
Venice.
Hate the place!
Took both my wives there.
The program about battered wives!
I want to listen to this.
Why?
I had two wives
and I beat them both.
That's horrible!
Yeah, I was wrong...
So I gave her a good hiding myself.
What's he taking pictures of?
Everything. Absolutely everything.
Another terrorist attack...
Listen to that!
Another fast-food joint
going up in smoke.
Last week it was two sports stores,
and last month a supermarket.
He's an "anti-globalization
protester".
He burns fast food?
I heard there's shit in their meat!
It's right here.
Didn't your train get in at nine?
Yeah, but with traffic, strikes...
France, what a mess!
What? Can't the poor
exploited nurses go on strike?
This isn't America!
You still have that huge suitcase.
You'll break your back!
You never listen, anyway.
If it's not...
Marion.
Mom, Marion's stuck again!
Mom, is Marion a retard?
We've got two willies!
Move it!
You've always done exactly
what you wanted.
And we had to fall in line.
Really, l...
Hello, madam.
Are you OK?
Give me the pussycat...
Here, your phone!
Come down for lunch at one.
Don't be late. Your dad hates that!
- How's Jean-Luc?
- Sleeping.
Am I disturbing you?
Don't come in,
we're getting changed.
I came to see
if you’ve got any clothes to wash.
- We'll bring it down later.
- OK, I'll wait.
- You'll wait downstairs?
- Yes.
Thanks.
Thanks, bye.
Dad?
- Oh, God!
- I'm going to start on the rabbit.
I have to chop it up.
All right?
All the sparrows in the garden
have been scared off by Jean-Luc.
Of course.
He'd gobble them up.
You think so? But he's so sweet.
Are you kidding?
It's only because we're bigger
and we feed him
that he doesn't eat us alive.
You're so negative!
Hasn't he put on weight?
I had some cans of foie gras
getting past their sell-by date...
You fed him foie gras?
You know he only eats dry cat food.
I've had him ten years
and that's all he eats.
Fat is bad for animals!
He's enormous!
He's like dad.
You get your hands on someone
and turn them into a fat lump.
They won't let me keep him
with me in the cabin.
That's why I have
to keep him under 5 kilos.
They'll put him in the luggage
compartment, drug him and...
Lots of animals die
during the flight.
How can you say that? I've taken care
of him for two weeks.
I love this cat
but your dad hates him,
he calls him "eat-shit-sleep".
He wanted to kick him out
and now you tell me...
Calm down.
- They'll put him in a cage!
- You're scaring him.
They're going to kill him!
What's going on?
We couldn't go on vacation
because of that spoiled doormat!
You say Paris is great in summer,
with all the filthy cars gone away.
If you upset your mother,
you'll be in trouble.
He's fat. He had them chopped off.
Like me!
That's why I got fat!
I had them chopped off
by your mother!
Bastard!
Your other cat!
He hasn't had them chopped off, huh?
Does he understand?
It's very hot. Watch out.
Lapin.
What's lapin?
Very good.
A thigh.
Plate.
A small piece.
I'm used to small ones!
- Marion?
- Some back.
Oh, the head!
For real men!
Real men eat the head.
Anna, pass your plate.
What a pain in the butt!
Got enough, dad? Is that your diet?
Rabbit is lean meat.
But look how much you're eating!
And look at your fat ass!
This guy is sick in the head!
I've got a fat ass because
I stopped smoking 18 months ago.
Jean not, that's enough!
Will you stop bugging her?
She's the one bugging us!
She came from New York especially!
Shut up, asshole!
Let's be civilized.
He came all this way to meet you.
Talk to him!
We'll talk to Jack, then.
We'll talk about
American literature.
Dad, don't start!
Rimbaud.
Rambo?
That's how they say it in English.
What a bunch of idiots!
Please!
Not bad!
See!
He's not like the morons
you usually bring home.
Thanks a lot!
With such a weird face
he better be smart!
It's Rose.
Hi.
It stinks in here!
Sorry, we didn't have time
to deodorize!
- Hi, dad.
- You're early.
I got out of work early.
- As attractive as in the photos!
- As nice as ever!
- Isn’t there any coffee?
- Yes, in the coffeepot.
- See to it, huh?
- As usual!
- She's getting worse.
- I pity the kids she takes care of.
I can hear you!
The catacombs and a cemetery?
A lot of fun, isn't he?
Mom, do you ever use your computer?
No. We asked Rose to teach us but...
I haven't had time.
You didn't show them at all?
Or fid someone else to do it?
You show up, hand out your presents,
and leave the rest to me.
But you help people
with learning disabilities.
Once and for all, I help children
with psychological problems,
not retards!
Hey, you two brats!
Just because you can send e-miles
doesn't make you superior.
You can put so many photos
on this thing!
Yes, it's digital.
Rose? Why did you say that?
It's just a joke. He didn't get it.
- You're a real pain!
- I didn't do anything!
Stop it, dad.
No, dad, please don't!
What a pain!
Please don't do this!
Nice weenie with balloons!
- You're unbelievable!
- I'm sorry.
Nice weenie!
Mom!
- Really, Anna!
- You're pains, all of you!
Stop being overprotective.
Drop by your dad's art gallery.
There's an opening.
Homosexuals! It's just not right.
It's disgusting!
Huh, Kiki? You wouldn't do that.
Are you all right, miss?
Manu!
- Marion? Amazing!
- OK?
I was talking about you...
- Only today.
- Really?
So what's new?
- Well, my book's just come out...
- Great! A novel?
No, short stories. But... linked.
Great!
This is Jack. Manu.
So that's it? You've settled
in the States for good?
For now, yeah.
I'm with Jack and it's going well.
What?
Are you going to Vanessa's tonight?
- Yes, for sure.
- Me too.
You haven't changed, it's amazing.
It's like time has stood still.
- Stop it!
- You decided not to age...
Cut the bullshit.
We spent all night on a train...
- You look gorgeous.
- Stop it.
- I swear.
- Stop it, stop it!
Well, we'd better go.
My dad has an opening later.
- Jeannot. Say hello for me.
- Yeah. See you later.
Are you American?
He is, I'm French.
We live in New York.
Cool! I love New York.
I went last year.
I loved downtown, Soho...
- Are you married?
- No.
- Do you have children?
- No.
Really? How old are you?
We're all friends here, right?
Yeah. I'm 35.
Don't wait too long.
Won't he give you one?
No, it's me.
No, no... I don't believe that.
All women want children.
It's in their nature.
If he doesn't want to,
I can help!
It's up to you, of course.
I make beautiful kids.
So if you want a Brad Pitt
or a George Clooney.
It's up to you.
You know who to call.
I'm just saying because...
you're not bad.
You look like
that American actress...
She's married to that guy
from Fatal Attraction. Douglas!
That's the one!
But I'm blonde
and I don't look like her.
But you've got exactly
the same face, sparkling eyes...
You're like twin sisters.
Except you're more beautiful,
of course.
'68, at the barricades!
Marion, "migraine"?
What's he saying?
Speak French, goddammit!
Are you nuts?
You'll scare him.
Red wine gives him migraines.
- The exhibition's fabulous, dad.
- Really, you like it?
Dad, show him my favorites.
I'll leave you with Jack.
You take care of him.
But we can't understand each other.
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?
Yeah, fine.
Goodbye, Jack. See you soon.
Elves came to help me one day
when I was looking for something
and they found it for me.
- Bullshit!
- I swear it's true!
I saw you from over there.
You're doing an exhibition?
Photos?
A bit more conceptual.
Sort of Bill Viola,
but more sexual!
You'd like it.
Manu!
D - C E I T
I really like this salad.
Are there mussels in it?
I can't take it.
We fight all the time.
I was talking to Jack.
Nice guy.
Yeah, nice.
Not uptight, not too American.
No broom up his ass.
Tattoos all over,
but I guess you must like that.
Well, he's been in jail so...
- A financial thing? Enron...
- No, he did eight years.
Homicide. First-degree murder.
This guy was staying
with him and his girlfriend.
Jack was 19 and he...
He has anger-management issues.
He invited me to stay
a few days in August but...
I wasn't sure I'd be able
to make it.
That sucks!
I'm going to get another drink.
All these off-the wall projects,
I couldn't do them here.
I had to, I had to...
These old perverts wanted me
to blow them. Disgusting!
That's disgusting.
You didn't have to blow anyone
to make it?
- In art you don't have to blow?
- No, you don't have to blow, but...
- You have to lick a bit!
- Yeah, that's it!
She's totally empty now.
Shit!
My contact lens.
There it is.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
Great!
I'll put it back in.
Hey, are you OK?
Don't fall.
The mussels.
I've just remembered, I'm allergic.
I ate mussels, didn't l?
I'm allergic to French mussels.
I don't have a pulse!
You had a dizzy spell!
- I had no pulse!
- Breathe deeply.
I had something stuck in my throat,
something hairy.
I'm allergic to French mussels,
you have to give me an injection!
You ate too much, that's all.
- Drink some water...
- I'm scared, doctor!
Get some fresh air, you'll be fine.
Your blood pressure's perfect.
Another Arab. The last one I took
jumped out without paying.
The other day I had some Germans.
Never again!
They had sausages in their bags.
It still stinks!
Nothing but Romanian scum!
Where's your friend from?
He doesn't speak French.
He's American.
American?
- You don't speak English.
- No, I don't.
- You don't speak many languages.
- What?
I speak French, that's enough, OK?
You don't want us in your taxi
because we're not speaking French?
Who do you pick up in your taxi?
You don't like Germans...
Arabs? No, you don't like Arabs.
The Romanians?
Send them home with their whores!
And gas the Jews!
Hey, I never said that!
Gas chambers were an invention
to get our money!
Are you sick in the head?
Listen to yourself!
Hey, dumb blonde,
who do you think you're talking to?
You're the fucking dumb blond!
We're getting out here.
Before you get out you pay me,
or we go straight to the cops.
We'll pay you, asshole!
We're rich, we're Americans!
You shut your mouth!
- I'll kick your ass!
- Whose ass you gonna kick?
You with the beard, shut up!
I'm just gonna find a spot to park,
and then we'll have a talk...
little woman.
We're gonna talk
about your little woman?
- No, I said you, little woman!
- I thought you meant your wife.
Because I heard
your wife's fucking an Arab.
Thank you so much.
That was very educational.
Thank you.
- Goodnight.
- Fuck you!
Bitch! Go get fucked
by your Yank!
Jeannot, there's water everywhere!
- Look at the carpet!
- Call the fire department!
- What is it?
- A pipe burst.
I'll cut the electricity.
They're on their way.
They told me to turn off the water.
Where's the main inlet?
I've no idea!
Go ask Mrs. Schindling.
- She knows?
- Yes!
- Mom, do you need help?
- Shit!
OK.
Sorry, we're firemen, not plumbers.
Shit, shit!
Sorry about my mom.
You live upstairs?
Yes, upstairs.
But I live in New York.
They have awesome fire trucks!
Fucking shit!
Those are great sweaters.
Can you buy them anywhere?
It's our uniform, given to us.
I think you can find them
on the internet now.
- It's nice wool.
- Touch it.
- It's great wool.
- No, it's OK.
Yeah, go on!
Not bad, huh?
Good quality!
Scottish wool!
What are they still doing here?
Help me instead of flirting!
We'd better go. Thanks.
Next time we'll call a plumber,
not the firemen. Thanks.
- Have a nice day.
- You too. Goodbye.
Something wrong with that guy!
Coming.
Bring your American to the market,
to see some real food!
I'll have a shower first.
Chaute.
- Chaud.
- Yes, it's hot.
- So why did he go to see his grave?
- It's a tourist thing.
- Does he know?
- No, I haven't told him.
I'll take this opportunity
to tell you.
The next time you go on vacation,
- leave your cat somewhere else.
- What do you mean?
What's the problem?
Every day at 5 am
he wants to get in the bathroom.
I told you he likes running water.
That cat is low maintenance.
Worse than a kid.
- Are you going to have one?
- Don't bug me.
Look how this one's parked!
Look at that one!
Dad, stop it!
Do it at night if you have to.
You're making Jack uncomfortable.
He doesn't like it.
Cornflowers.
Yes, cornflowers.
I'll come back for them later.
I won't pay you with my body today,
my daughter's with me!
"Sleep" not "slip"!
He doesn't sleep in a nighty!
Pig.
He was suckling last night.
- What's that tongue?
- Calf.
I'm sick.
- He has a bit of a cold.
- A hangover?
- He's sick?
- Just a cold.
Let's go
to the organic vegetables stall.
You make me as hard as wood!
Mathieu
Hello, madam.
Sorry, I thought
you were at the market.
I washed your shirts.
You don't mind?
Thanks very much.
I had a short affair with him.
No Aids, no death...
Abortion movement...
The 343 Bitches movement...
I was one of the bitches!
Lovely flowers, miss!
Stop hitting
on every girl, dad, please!
- Hitting on them?
- Anything that moves!
I only hit on pretty girls!
You loved it, you hussy
Having me lick your pussy...
I'm your salami for life
- What music would you like?
- What do you have?
Brel, Ferre, Trenet,
Barbara.
- Whatever you prefer.
- I'll put something on for you.
And tons of cake servers
A 10-speed blender
Just for your vinaigrettes
A beautiful air-purifier
That eats all smells
Heated blankets
Waffle irons
An airplane for two
And we'll be happy!
Hi.
Still writing
for that right-wing rag?
OK, Edouard?
At least you're faithful
to your friends.
Shall we go?
Have you decided?
A beer, please.
An omelet.
How was your trip
to the Philippines?
Gael.
Edouard.
The trip you dumped me for,
to be "free".
Let's go.
Ex-pats never get over
those exotic countries.
It's like former colonials.
Life's so good there.
The women are...
so gentle, so young.
Finished?
It speaks!
You've grown some balls.
Interesting!
You couldn't handle me
dumping you.
What I couldn't handle
was something else!
But I better not say.
You're not that dull.
I found that out later on.
You weren't my type, period.
Wanna know what his type is?
Shut up!
No, I'm not his type.
He worked for an NGO in Thailand,
and screwed 12-year-olds!
A 30-year-old is less sexy
than a "woman" of 12!
You're crazy,
it's all in your head.
Oh, yes, I forgot.
He explained to me.
We judge it with our Western minds.
We shouldn't.
It's different over there.
It's normal for women
and children to be prostitutes.
It's their culture. You shouldn't
feel guilty about screwing them.
It's true.
You pretend to help the Third World
but screw them like everyone else!
Just because I ditched you!
All I wanted was a chick
who can shut up.
A 12-year-old
knows how to do that.
But I don't!
Edouard, he screwed
the love of your life
on vacation.
Oh, darn it!
He didn't... You never told him?
Oh, I'm sorry, really!
Shut up,
cunt!
She's insane!
I'm calm now.
That's enough!
- We didn't break anything.
- Go on, get outta here!
This shows France in a great light!
Tourists!
What means "lick pussy"?
You sicko!
Sir, I don't speak English.
Sir, there's the salad menu,
the veggie menu and the double menu.
Just choose one of them.
It's simple.
That'll be 5 euros 30.
Thank you, goodbye.
Hi, Mathieu, it's Marion.
It's weird that you called.
I just took it out of my workshop,
and I'm just finishing it off.
And there it is!
But... what is it? Who is it?
It's you.
Not bad, eh?
It's beautiful.
Your style's really developed.
Yeah, you're right.
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
It's you. It's incredible.
The restroom's full of smoke.
Someone locked the door.
I'll explain about the messages.
What will you tell him?
That it was a joke,
that I don't give a shit,
and that I obviously don't love you!
Nobody wants me.
I can't take it anymore!
That's not tr...
Come on out of there.
What are you doing?
Don't break or dirty anything.
I'll call your sister.
Outta my way, jerk!
My bag, my bag! It's him!
My bag! Thief! Thief!
American, my ass! Filthy Arab!
My bag!
Police!
Marion, just come out, OK?
Mathieu doesn't want to touch me.
I repulse men! I'm a fat tuna!
What's all this?
No, I tried to kiss her, but
she keeps sobbing, it's impossible.
Of course. She's in love
with her boyfriend. No psychology!
Marion, what got into you,
wanting to screw this idiot?
I'll leave you to it.
Sorry, sir, we made a mistake.
We're really sorry.
- Are you sure it's not him?
- Yes, we're sure.
A cup of tea.
Sorry about your soap holder.
I'm sorry too.
What did you do?
- I dropped it by accident.
- You broke it?
- The poor guy. You show up...
- I'm horrible, I know.
The old fill-in guy!
We get all wound up with jealousy
and shit, and we've got everything!
We're shallow with
bourgeois problems, as mom says.
And there are people dying in wars.
Marion, don't start again.
The other day
I read this article that said...
What?
We use more toilet paper than men
because we wipe when we pee.
Each time I wipe now
I think about it.
- About what?
- All that we destroy.
I love you, sister.
You're a pain, but I adore you.
Is it your little bunny?
No, it's you.
I'm talking to you.
- Thank you, sister.
- You're so dumb!
I'd better go.
- And see your guy?
- I don't know.
