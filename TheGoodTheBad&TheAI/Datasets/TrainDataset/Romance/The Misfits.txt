Young man, do you have the time?
l got six clocks, and none of them work.
- Twenty after nine.
- After?
lt's twenty after, dear. Darlin'?
- Five minutes. What about you?
- l'm all set. l just ironed my sling.
- The lawyer said 9.30 sharp, darlin'.
- OK.
l hope you're not the miserly kind.
lt's brand-new.
She ought to get a very good price for it.
ls that the right mileage? 23 miles?
We only took two rides in it.
lt's the darn men.
They run into her
just to start a conversation.
- Will you come up, lz?
- Sure, dear.
Don't go by appearances. lt's brand-new.
lt was a divorce present
from her husband.
- They givin' presents for divorces now?
- Why not?
On the anniversary of our divorce,
my husband always sends me...
..one potted yellow rose,
and it'll be 19 years in July.
Course, he never did pay me the alimony.
But l wouldn't wanna put a man out,
you know, if his heart's not in it.
You break your arm in the car?
No. My last roomer, the one before Mrs
Taber, we celebrated her divorce and...
..l misbehaved.
l'm so sick and tired of myself.
- Will you go over my answers again?
- Sure, dear.
But don't worry, you'll do wonderfully.
Let's see. ''Did your husband,
Mr Raymond Taber,...
..act toward you with cruelty?''
Darlin'?
- Well, yes.
- Just say yes.
Yes.
''ln what way did this cruelty
manifest itself?''
He persistently... How does that go again?
''He persistently and cruelly ignored
my personal wishes and my rights,...
..and resorted on several occasions
to physical violence against me.''
He persistently...
Oh, do l have to say that?
Why can't l just say he wasn't there? He...
You could touch him, but he wasn't there.
lf that was grounds for divorce,...
..there'd only be about 1 1 marriages
left in the US. Now just repeat after me.
- ''He persistently...
- He persistently...
They'll call in their estimate, ma'am.
Those dents aren't my fault, you know.
l'll recommend
the best price l can, ma'am.
You can drive her now.
l've put in a new battery.
l'll never drive that car again.
Let's take a taxi.
l... l'll give you a lift
if you're leaving right away.
Swell. Two minutes.
lz, get dressed! You gotta be my witness.
This'll be my 77th time
l've witnessed for a divorce.
Two sevens - that's lucky, darlin'!
Oh, lz, l hope.
- Easy does it, now.
- Oh, you're a dear.
- Here we are.
- Thanks a lot. We've gotta go now.
lf you're not goin' back East right away,
l'd be glad to show you the county.
Beautiful country around here, you know.
Well, l don't know where l'll be, but OK.
Thanks again.
My name is lsabelle Steers.
lsabelle. Well, OK, you come along too.
That's a sweet afterthought!
You Reno men!
l can't memorise this.
lt's not the way it was.
Just say it. lt doesn't have to be true.
This isn't a quiz show, it's only a court.
- l just got off the plane...
- l don't wanna hear anything.
Just give me five minutes.
After two years, five minutes...
You can't have me now,
so you want me, that's all.
Please, l'm not blaming you. lt's... l just
don't believe in the whole thing any more.
Kid, l understand. l understand...
You don't understand.
You're not there, Raymond.
lf l'm gonna be alone,
l wanna be by myself.
Go back. You're not gonna make me
feel sorry for you any more.
Gay!
Wait up! l was just goin' over to see ya!
Well, good luck now, Susan.
l won't forget you, you can be sure of that.
- l don't even know where to write you.
- General delivery. l'll get it.
Will you think about it? lt's the
second-largest laundry in St Louis.
l wouldn't wanna kid you.
l ain't cut out for business.
Well, will you think of me? Oh, Gay...
Oh, you know l will, honey. Goodbye.
Bye.
How're you doin', boy?
Ready to cut out of this town? Cos l am.
Well, l've been thinkin' about it.
- Which one was that?
- Susan. Swell sport, that woman.
l just met me a girl sweet enough to eat,
Gay. Fine-lookin' woman.
But when l think of all the useless talkin'
you gotta do, l get discouraged.
l tell you, l'm dyin' for some fresh air.
And no people, male or female.
Why don't we take out to the mountains?
We could even do a little mustangin'.
l wanted to pile up about 500 this time.
- l need a new engine.
- That engine'll fly you anywhere.
Say, you've been two months on this job.
You'll get the habit.
l'll see you over at Harrah's later.
Let's talk about it.
Tom Dooley.
lf you throw in your ring
you'll never get another divorce.
Go ahead, honey. Everybody does it.
More gold in that river
than there is in the Klondike.
- Did you do that?
- Who, me? No.
l lost my ring on my honeymoon.
- Let's get a drink.
- That's my girl.
Wait a minute, honey.
This machine loves me.
Never say die.
Scotch, l guess, on i... Yeah, on ice.
- Rye and water.
- Scotch on ice, rye and water.
Well, cheer up.
l will. l just hate to fight with anybody.
When you win, you lose.
You know, in your heart.
Well, you're free. Maybe the trouble is
you're not used to it yet.
No, the trouble is l always
end up back where l started.
Never had anybody much. And here l am.
Well, you had your mother, didn't you?
How do you have somebody
who disappears all the time?
They both weren't there. She'd go off
with a patient for three months and...
You know how long
three months is to a kid.
Listen, don't leave. Settle here.
They got a school.
You could teach dancing.
One thing about this town,
it's always full of interesting strangers.
Oh, l'm sorry. What did l say? l...
l suddenly miss my mother.
Oh, isn't that the stupidest thing?
lz, you're a fine woman. Practically the
only woman that's ever been my friend.
Well, drink up then.
Oh, isn't that the dearest dog?
Look how sweet he sits there.
Yeah. Dogs are nice.
Here. Puppy.
Hey, Dooley.
Hello. How'd you make out?
OK.
l'd like you to meet
a friend of mine. Gay...
Gay Langland, Mrs Taber.
- Howdy do?
- And this is Mrs, uh...?
Steers. lsabelle Steers. One thing about
Reno men, they do remember the name.
- Why don't you boys sit down?
- Thank you. What're you girls drinkin'?
Whiskey. We're celebratin'
the jail burned down.
Mary, see if you can get
four doubles, will you?
Uh... you sure made a big impression
on my friend here. And l can see why.
- You a mechanic too?
- Him? He's a cowboy.
- How'd you know?
- l can smell, can't l?
- Hey, you can't smell cows on me.
- l smell the look on your face, cowboy.
But l love every miserable one of ya.
Course, you're all good for nothin',
as you know.
That may be. But it's better than wages.
l suppose you'll be headin'
back East soon, Mrs Taber?
l can't make up my mind.
l don't know yet what to do.
You don't have a business to run,
or a school to teach, or...?
Me? l never finished high school.
Well! That's real good news.
- You don't like educated women?
- They're all right.
Always wantin' to know
what you're thinkin', that's all.
Maybe they want to get to know you.
Did you ever get to know a man better
by askin' him questions?
- You mean he'd lie?
- Well, he might not.
And then again, he just might.
How about it, Pilot?
We takin' off today?
You ever been outside Reno, Mrs Taber?
l walked to the edge of town.
Doesn't look like much is out there.
Everything's there.
- Like what?
- The country.
- Well, what do you do with yourself?
- Just live.
- How do you just live?
- Well, you start by goin' to sleep.
You get up when you feel like it.
You scratch yourself. You fry some eggs.
You see what kind of a day it is.
You throw stones at a can and whistle.
l know what you mean.
l have an empty house in the country
just beyond Hawleyville.
lt's all yours if you want some
peace and quiet before you go back.
The last woman's gone?
No kiddin'. l never offered it before.
Well, l wouldn't stay there. But let's rent
a car. We could look at the country.
- Gay has a truck. You can have my car.
- Then you'll have to drive me back.
- l don't mind.
- Thanks, but l like to feel l'm on my own.
- l'll rent a car. Where can l?
- Right now?
- Why not?
- OK. You sure don't waste time, do you?
l just gotta stop by the garage and quit.
Hey, now, that's the boy.
No, Gay. This is mine.
Mm. What is that beautiful smell?
Smells like green perfume.
- That's sage, darlin'.
- Oh, sure!
l never smelled it except in bottles.
Gee, it's beautiful here.
Look, dear girl, l think l better
tell you somethin' about cowboys.
- You really worry about me, don't you?
- Well, you're too believin'.
Cowboys are the last real men left,...
..and they're about as reliable
as jack rabbits.
ls anybody any different?
Maybe you're not supposed to believe
people. Maybe it's not even fair to them.
l couldn't hear what he said to her, but
it looked like she left him. The husband.
She's kinda hard to figure out, you know?
One minute she looks kinda dumb
and brand-new, like a kid,...
..and the next minute...
- She sure moves, though, don't she?
- Mm. She's real prime.
- lt isn't finished yet.
- lt's weathertight. Come on in.
lt's insulated.
Flush doors.
This is the living room.
And this was gonna be another bedroom.
lt's even nicer this way.
Here's a picture window.
Take a look at this view.
- Take a look at that.
- Gee. lt goes on for ever.
Fireplace.
- Brick.
- This is the kitchen.
- Gas refrigerator.
- lt's nice.
And here's the bathroom. Ceramic tile.
Here's our... This was our bedroom.
My wife. She died here.
l'm... sorry.
She was due to have a baby. l was up
setting the capstone on the chimney...
..and she screamed...
..and that was that.
Couldn't you call a doctor?
She didn't seem to be that sick.
Then l got a flat. l didn't have a spare.
Everything just happened wrong.
lt'll do that sometimes.
Yeah, l know.
Uh, you couldn't live here any more, huh?
We knew each other
since we were seven years old, see?
You ought to find yourself another girl.
l don't know. Me with anybody else,
it seems impossible, you know?
She wasn't like any other women.
Stood behind me 100 per cent,
uncomplaining as a tree.
Maybe that's what killed her.
l mean, a little complaining
helps sometimes maybe.
Hey, lz, isn't this a beautiful place here?
Yeah. lt'd be just perfect if somebody'd
bring in that bottle of whiskey l bought.
- With my own money.
- Hey, that's right!
And bring that bag of groceries.
Maybe somebody wants a sandwich.
The glasses are in the kitchen, lsabelle.
l'm real tired.
No, you're just a cowboy, darlin'.
You fellas won't move
unless it's rainin' down your necks.
Too rough for you, Roslyn?
l don't mind that.
You should've seen his wife. She helped
pour cement and knocked in nails.
She was a real good sport.
Now she's dead because
he didn't have a spare tyre.
Well, that's the way it goes.
lt goes the other way too, though.
Don't forget that.
lt's sure nice to see people in here.
Come on, let's have a drink.
- l'll start the fridge. lt makes ice quick.
- lce? We gonna stay that long, Roslyn?
- l don't know.
- Oh, sure. Come on.
There's no better place to be. And you
couldn't find better company, either.
- All right.
- That's it, sport.
Turn on that ice, Guido. Let's get this stuff
a-flowin', make the desert bloom.
Well, flow it slow. We only got one bottle.
There. Put that in your thoughts
and see how they come out.
Come on, sit down, everybody.
Let's get comfortable.
- l'm sure glad you like this place.
- Here's to Nevada, the ''leave it'' state.
- The what state?
- The ''leave it'' state.
You got money to gamble, leave it here.
A wife you wanna get rid of,
get rid of her here.
Extra atom bomb you don't need, blow it
up here. Nobody will mind in the slightest.
The slogan of Nevada is ''Anything goes,
but don't complain if it went.''
- That's no lie.
- l even left my Southern accent here.
How come you never went back home?
You came here for a divorce, didn't you?
- l wasn't beautiful enough to go back.
- Oh, lsabelle.
No, that's true. Beauty's a help any place,
but in Virginia it's a necessity.
Why, you can't hardly
get a driver's licence without it.
No, l love Nevada. You know, they don't
even have regular meal times here.
Never met so many people
didn't own a watch.
Might have two wives at the same time,
but no watch. Bless them all.
How quiet it is here.
Sweetest sound there is.
There's an lndian store about five miles,
if you wanna shop. Groceries, everything.
lf you wanna stay, that is.
Be glad to come by
and do your chores, if you like.
You know, he reminds me of that
cowboy friend l told you about.
Had one arm gone, but he was
more man with one arm...
..than any other man is with two.
Oh?
- l mean like cookin'.
- Oh!
No, l'm serious. He could take
a panful of chops, toss 'em,...
..and they all came down
on the other side.
- Who is he? Maybe they know him.
- Darlin', you can't go lookin' for a man.
- What, did he take off?
- No, not exactly.
He just never came back.
- Andy Powell. You ever...?
- Sure! Called Andy Gump sometimes?
That's him.
- You know where he is?
- Saw him at the rodeo only last month.
- Maybe we could find him.
- Stop thinkin' you can change things.
But if there's something you can do...
l don't know what to do,
but if l knew, l'd do it.
Have you got a radio or a phonograph?
Maybe we'll have some music.
- There's no electricity.
- The car radio.
- Now who'd have thought of that?
- You always get an idea, don't you?
l'll go bring the car round.
Say, how about another drink
to keep that first one warm?
- l'd love it.
- l'm gonna make myself a sandwich.
- How about you folks?
- OK.
l hope you're gonna stay on here.
Any chance?
Why? What difference would it make?
Might make all the difference in the world
as time goes by.
- Like to dance?
- OK.
Thanks. lz, give him another drink.
lt's a wonderful house, Guido.
Hey, that's pretty good dancin', cowboy.
What are you doin'?
She used to teach dancin'.
You know? Before she was married.
- No kiddin'? ln a dance hall?
- Uh-huh.
How about the landlord?
Move over, boy, huh?
- Watch out for those pretty little feet.
- She knows how to get out of the way.
Let's go.
Where'd you learn that, Pilot?
l never knew him to dance at all.
Look at old Pilot comin' out
from under a bushel!
Hey, you two ought to put on a show!
Come on, honey. This is a good one.
l haven't danced like this in years.
- Didn't your wife dance?
- Not like you. She had no gracefulness.
Why didn't you teach her to be graceful?
You can't learn that.
How do you know?
l mean, how do you know?
You see, she died, and she didn't
know how you can dance.
To a certain extent,
maybe you were strangers.
- l don't feel like discussing my wife.
- Don't be mad.
l only meant that if you loved her
you could've taught her anything.
Because... we're all dying, aren't we?
All the husbands and all the wives.
Every minute.
And we're not teaching each other
what we really know, are we?
Dum da-da... dum...
Guido, you're a nice man.
Smile.
Come on.
- Come on, lz.
- l'm lookin' for your shoes, dear girl.
Watch out. There's no step!
We better get you home, girl.
You were worried about me. How sweet.
Just wanna keep you
all in one pretty piece.
Would you have had a spare tyre?
Somebody'd better drive her.
Go ahead. l'll take the truck.
Oh, lz, don't leave poor Guido alone.
Tom Dooley!
You're a real beautiful woman.
lt's almost kind of an honour
sittin' next to you.
You just shine in my eyes.
That's my true feelin', Roslyn.
What makes you so sad? l think
you're the saddest girl l ever met.
You're the first man that ever said that.
l'm usually told how happy l am.
That's because you make
a man feel happy.
l don't feel that way about you, Gay.
Well, don't get discouraged, girl.
You might.
Look, why don't you try it out here
for a while, see what happens?
You know, sometimes when
a person don't know what to do,...
..the best thing is to just stand still.
l'll guarantee you'll have something out
here you wouldn't find on every corner.
l, uh... l may not amount to much
in some ways, but l am a good friend.
Thanks.
Let me take you back and get your things.
Try it for a while, see what happens.
Ever hear the story
about the city man out in the country?
He sees this fella sittin' on his porch,
so he says ''Mister,...
..could you tell me how l can get back
to town?'' The fella says ''No.''
''Well, could you tell me how to get
to the post office?'' The fella says ''No.''
''Well, do you know how to get
to the railroad station?'' ''No.''
''Boy,'' he says, ''you sure
don't know much, do you?''
The fella says ''Nope. But l ain't lost.''
Don't you have a home?
Sure. Never was a better one, either.
Where is it?
Right here.
Come on. l got a surprise for you.
You cooked breakfast. Here, let me.
No, no, no. You sit down
and enjoy yourself. Just this once.
- You do this often?
- Uh-uh. First time for me.
- Really and truly?
- Mm-hm.
Mm. Smells delicious.
Hey, you really go all out, don't you?
Even the way you eat. l like that.
Women generally pick.
You like me, huh?
Birds must be brave to live out here.
At night especially.
- Whereas they're so small, you know?
- Mm-hm.
- You think l'm crazy.
- l look that way cos l can't make you out.
- Why?
- l don't know.
You got children?
- l never wanted children with him.
- Oh.
Children are supposed to bring you
together. But what if they don't?
l've known of so-called
happily married couples.
One time, the wife was in the hospital
to have the baby...
..and the husband was calling me up.
l mean, he was calling me.
They're still supposed
to be happily married.
l guess you believe in true love,
don't you?
l don't know, but they ought to invent
a way that you don't have children...
..unless you care for each other,
cos kids know the difference.
l always knew the difference.
Listen, if you wanna go somewhere,
l don't mind being alone.
- Do l look like l wanna leave?
- l just want you to do what you feel like.
You ain't kiddin'. Even when
you're kiddin', you ain't kiddin'.
No. lt makes me feel peaceful.
You know, they come out here
from New York, Chicago, St Louis,...
..and find them a cowboy. Cowboys
are supposed to be dumb, you know.
So they tell 'em everything.
And they do everything.
Everything they couldn't do back home.
- lt's pitiful.
- Why is it pitiful?
Cowboy's laughin' at 'em,
and they don't even know it.
lt's nice to meet someone
who has respect for a man.
Did you ever think
of getting married again?
Yeah. l've thought about it a lot of times.
But never in daylight.
- You get lonesome for your children?
- Oh, l see 'em now and then.
They come whenever l'm in a rodeo.
l'm a pretty good roper.
l get lonesome, sure.
My daughter is almost your size.
Uh... You size 1 2?
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. So is she.
l bought her a dress for Christmas.
Size 1 2.
What happened?
Did you just stop loving your wife, Gay?
Well, l come home one night and
she's all wrapped up in a car with a fella.
Turned out to be an old friend.
A cousin of mine, as a matter of fact.
Oh. You never had any idea, huh?
No. You know, in those days
l thought you got married and that was it.
But nothin' is it. Not for ever.
That's what l can't get used to.
Everything keeps changing.
l'll tell you this, though. l wouldn't know
how to say goodbye to you, Roslyn.
lt surprises me.
There's a lot to be done around this place.
lf we were gonna stay awhile.
Let's go out in the sunshine. Come on.
Let's just live like you said in the bar.
l don't know where l am yet.
Hey! Couldn't we use that for a step?
Well, we just might at that.
- There you are.
- Let me try it.
lt's perfect. l can go in...
and l can come out.
Go in... and l can come out.
Go in...
..and l can come out.
l can go in...
..and l can come out.
Guido!
- What's he doing?
- Might land. There's a place back there.
Nah. l guess he's just sayin' hello.
- Here, have some lemonade.
- Oh, thanks.
- What does he do? Just fly around?
- Could be goin' for eagles.
Now and again ranchers
hire Guido to shoot eagles.
- Why?
- Well, they kill a lot of lambs.
He gets $50 a bird.
l never really saw anything grow before.
How tiny those seeds were. And yet they
know they're supposed to be lettuces.
You say the darnedest things.
You know that, don't you?
Everybody's busy in Chicago,
and here we are.
l love this whole state!
Hey... What have we here now?
Well... Just plain old rabbit!
l'm gonna get him.
lt's just one lettuce.
Maybe he won't do it any more.
No, ma'am! lt's them or us! There won't
be a thing left inside of a week.
Couldn't you wait and see?
l can't stand to see anything killed.
- Honey, it's only a rabbit.
- But it doesn't know any better, does it?
Go on inside and let me handle this.
- l know you worked hard...
- You're darn right!
And l didn't do it
for some bug-eyed rabbit.
- Gay, please.
- Honey, will you go on inside now?
- And stop bein' silly?
- l'm not being silly.
You don't respect what l feel.
- And l don't care about the lettuce!
- l care about it!
And how about havin'
some respect for me?
Oh, Guido and lsabelle!
- Guido!
- Dear girl!
l thought l saw a passenger!
We never heard you land.
- My, you look thrivin'.
- Boy, am l in the right place?
Seen the vegetable garden?
Took Gay a week just to turn the soil.
Mowed the grass
and put in them flowers too.
l got your windows unstuck.
Fireplace don't smoke now.
You must be a magician. All he ever did
for a woman was get out the ice cubes.
- Look, we have chairs. Come and sit.
- Let's show him the inside.
You know, l've moved this furniture
so many times, l'm gettin' long ears!
My, you look lovely. You've really
found yourself, haven't you?
Well, l... Oh, it's so nice to see you,
lsabelle. Look, we have a step.
- How's your arm?
- Well, it's still as weak as a bird's wing.
Well, l never saw anything like it
in my life. lt's magical.
Just hope you realise you finally
made contact with a real woman.
My dear girl!
Come, Guido. l wanna show you the rest.
l've changed a few things, though.
We've changed things around.
How do you like it?
Oh, don't look at those.
Gay just hung 'em up for a joke.
l put your picture up in the living room.
Come on, let's have lots of drinks.
Come on.
Oh, it's so nice to have company.
- l put your picture there. ls that all right?
- You don't have to keep it out.
Why, Guido, it's part of the house.
Besides, it's your house.
Oh, sit in the big chair.
This must've been your chair.
Matter of fact, it was.
lsabelle. Put this under your arm.
Thanks, dear girl.
l used to do all my studyin' in this chair.
When l was still ambitious.
What did you study?
l was on my way to bein' a doctor.
Before the war.
Well, you never can tell.
Maybe you'll get ambitious again.
l'm gonna tell you somethin', Roslyn.
l spent four years in the war.
Did two tours, flew 50 missions.
Every time l came back to base
l started to design this house.
But somehow l could never
get it to look like my idea of it.
Now it almost does.
You just walk in,
a stranger out of nowhere,...
..and for the first time it all lights up.
And l'm sure you know why too.
- Why?
- Because you have the gift for life.
The rest of us, we're just lookin' for
a place to hide and watch it all go by.
Amen.
Here's to your life, Roslyn.
l hope it goes on for ever.
And yours. And yours, lsabelle.
And Gay. Gay did all the work, you know.
Yeah. And the rabbits
are sure enjoyin' it too.
Can you break away from this paradise
long enough to do a little mustangin'?
Mustangin'? Now you're sayin' somethin'.
You been up in the mountains?
Took a quick look earlier this mornin'.
l spotted 1 5 horses.
That's not too bad.
Boy, l'd sure like
to get my hands on a rope again.
- What do you say?
-  l will never understand cowboys.
All crazy about animals, and
the minute they got nothin' else to do,...
..they run up in the mountains
and bother those poor wild horses.
Shame on you!
Horses?
Sure. Nevada mustang. Used
to ship 'em all over the United States.
Not many left.
We'd have to pick up another man.
Dayton Rodeo's on today. We ought
to be able to pick up a fella there.
That's an idea.
Hey, you never saw a rodeo.
Oh, you gotta see a rodeo!
- l'd love to. Will you come too?
- l'm all set.
- l'll get dressed up. Let's have some fun!
- That's a girl. Go right now.
Honey, when you smile
it's like the sun comin' up.
Boy, l'd like to have stopped off home
and get cleaned up.
Why? You look nice. Doesn't he?
- Lots better than some l've known.
- You're a mass of compliments, lsabelle.
Hey, Gay, stop. That guy next
to the phone booth. What's his name?
- You worked the Stinson Rodeo with him.
- Perce Howland?
Gay Langland! You old buzzard, you!
What are you doin' sittin' out here, fella?
Well, l hitched a ride
down to the Dayton Rodeo,...
..but this fella changed his mind
and just left me settin' here.
Roslyn, this is Perce Howland.
Well, old Gay's sure comin' up
in the world. How do, ma'am?
- This is lsabelle.
-
Oh, 'scuse me. l got a call in for home,
but they keep puttin' me in to Wyoming.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, Ma? This is Perce.
Yeah, l'm OK.
No. l was in Colorado. l'm in Nevada now.
Just won me a bull ride.
Yeah.
Yeah, a pretty good rodeo.
A hundred dollars.
Ma, l was gonna buy you
a birthday present with it,...
..but l was comin' out of my boots.
No, Ma, l haven't been in hospital since
l talked to you. l just bought some boots.
Ma, what would l wanna get married for?
l just bought me...
Hey, you know what? On top of purse
money, l won me a nice silver buckle.
Yeah. Got a buckin' horse on it and
my entire name written out underneath.
You proud?
Oh, no, no. My face is fine. lt's all
healed up. lt's just as good as new.
You would too recognise me.
Oh, OK, operator. Ma, listen.
Say hello to Frieda for me, will you?
And to Victoria.
Yeah, and to Uncle George.
OK, say hello to him too.
No, no, Ma. lt just
slipped my mind, that's all.
Well, OK, l'm sayin' it now.
Ma, you married him, l didn't.
So say hello to him.
Oh, is that...? Listen, maybe
l'll call you at Christmas time.
OK.
Hello? Hello?
God bless you too.
l just know you'll take me to that rodeo.
Sure. You entered?
Well, l aim to be,
if l can get me a ride to town.
And, uh, if l can raise $10
for the entrance.
But l just spent my last $2 in that phone
booth. Boy, l'm real equipped, ain't l?
Say, how'd you like to do some
mustangin'? We need a third man.
You still fly that DC-6 and seven eighths?
lt's a lot safer than buckin' horses.
- There are still mustangs around here?
- l spotted 1 5 this morning.
- There might be a lot more, though.
- Well, l don't know.
What do you expect to get out of it?
Of 1 5 horses?
l mean, like, if there was
a thousand or more...
But goin' all the way up there for 1 5,
it kinda hits me sideways.
- Better than wages, ain't it?
- Oh, anything's better than wages.
l tell you what. We'll drive you to
the rodeo, put up the ten for the entrance.
You come along tomorrow
and help us run some mustang.
All right. You get me a good bottle of
whiskey to keep me primed for the rodeo.
Just wait right here.
You, uh... you an old friend of Gay's?
Pretty old.
l broke my arm twice -
no, three times, in the same place.
And you don't do that fakin' a fall.
You know what some of these riders do?
They just drop off and lay there
like they was stone-dead.
Not me, boy. l don't fake nothin'.
Right, Gay?
That's right.
You're just a natural-born fool.
lt's wonderful to be that way.
l know what you mean.
l used to dance in places,
and everybody thought l was crazy.
l mean, l really tried.
People don't know the difference.
- Oh, she'd try. l can just see her tryin'.
- What kind of dancin' do you do?
Oh, interpretive dancing.
You know, nightclubs and... That's all.
l was in a nightclub once
in Kansas City called The Naked Truth.
And they wasn't kiddin'!
Dayton comin' up.
Hey, Joe! Hi, Joe!
Hey, Bengie! Hey!
Hi, you old heathen, you!
- Hey, gimme.
- Hiya, Perce.
Oh, there's Franklin.
Boy, does he hate his wife.
Hey, Franklin, how's your wife?
Man, there are a lot of good men here.
l sure hope l drew me a good horse.
Just come out in one piece now,
cos you gotta go mustangin' tomorrow.
- Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
- Sure.
- How about you, sinner?
- Oh, l got no money yet.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Frank, Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
- You just caught me at the bar next door.
- That'll learn you to stay put.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary...
Come on, l'll buy you a drink.
Excuse me, cousin.
There ain't many of us left now.
No. Things is tough all over, pop.
Come on, son. Give me a great big glass
of soda pop for my grandson Lester.
l gotta hold onto him tight,
otherwise he'll run off to school.
Hey, wait till l show you this.
Here is the goldarnedest contraption
that anybody ever seen.
You gotta hit the ball.
- You catch what l mean?
- l can do it. Let me try.
l'll bet you $2 you can't hit it
ten times in a row.
Wait. l'll take that bet.
- Go on. Go on.
- l can do ten, l think.
Here's the paddle. Gangway,
gangway, everybody. Got a bet on.
..2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,...
..1 1 , 1 2, 1 3, 14, 1 5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,...
..1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 30...
..5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
Here, do it while the spirit's in you.
- Here, here. What's the trouble?
- He put his hand on her.
- That right, fella?
- l didn't mean nothin' by it.
- What's goin' on? You lookin' for a fight?
- All right, all right. Let's get to the rodeo.
Here. lt's the kid's.
lsabelle, come on.
Lester! Where'd you get the money?
A-ha-ha!
One hundred... One hundred
and forty-five bucks!
- Hello, gold mine.
- That girl can do anything.
l'd marry you.
Thanks for saying it,
but you don't have to do that.
Don't shake that thing at me!
l'm still payin' for this broken arm.
Charles!
lt's in the middle of your pretty eyes.
You're looking for the light, sinner.
l know you, and l love you
for your life of pain and sin.
Give it to the only one
who loves you in your lonely desert.
- She ain't sinned that much.
- We're going to fence off the graveyard.
Keep these cowboys from pasturing
their horses on the graves.
Sweetheart, you've gone and helped
our dead to rest in peace. Go reborn.
Who do you think is here, dear girl?
Who do you think is here?
- Who?
- My husband.
Oh, lz! l'm so happy.
l never was so surprised.
They're here on their vacation.
- His wife?
- Clara. You've heard me speak about her.
She's my oldest friend,
and she's sweeter than ever.
She must be, to make you
so glad to see her.
Charles never would've stayed married to
me. l even lost the vacuum cleaner once.
They still haven't found it.
- Well, we gotta get this boy on a horse.
- l'll be around. But l can't go mustangin'.
They're gonna stay
at my house for a week.
- Good luck, boy. So long.
- Oh, lsabelle...
Jim Palem in the saddle,
now ready to go on Polka Dot, gate one.
Here he comes.
- l didn't know it was that dangerous!
- That's the way they want it.
Look. See that strap they've taken off?
That's what makes 'em buck.
- That grabs 'em where they don't like it.
- That's not fair!
Well, you wouldn't
have a rodeo otherwise.
Then they shouldn't have a rodeo.
Lester, what are you tryin' to do?!
- Don't break it, Grandpa.
- Don't get mad about it. Come on, Lester.
- l hope you're sober.
- Man, l've won buckets of money...
..in towns l couldn't remember the name.
Hey, there she is.
l mean, there they are.
Gay, l wouldn't, uh...
l wouldn't wanna move in on you.
- Unless, of course, you wouldn't mind.
- Boy, l'd mind.
The next rider is Perce Howland
ofBlack River, Wyoming.
- California, not Wyoming.
- Ready, boy?
- Outside.
- Open the gate!
Come on, Perce!
