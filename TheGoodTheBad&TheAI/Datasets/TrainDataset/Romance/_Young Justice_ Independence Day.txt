-
- Ohh!
-
- Enjoying family time?
My family has other plans.
-
- Batman.
I was wondering when--
- Ha ha ha!
- Oh. Boy Wonder.
The Bat sent you to drag
me off to prison?
Frankly, I'm underwhelmed.
- Great, but I'm kind of
in a hurry here.
- Kids--always in such a rush.
I prefer to preserve
these moments forever.
- Not talking to you.

- Ha ha ha!
Unh!
Ohh!
Finally! I was wondering
what a guy had to do to get
A little attention
around here.
Unh!
- Junior's doing
this for attention?
I'm telling you now.
This little distraction
better not interfere.
- Ha ha ha! Kid had
a glass jaw.
- Hilarious. Can we go?
Today's the day.
- Don't tell me
you're not excited.
- Right now, my king, I'm more
focused on the matter at hand.
- Unh!
- Well?
- Yes, I'm excited.
Today's the day.
- Stealing ice? Seriously?
Isn't that a bit cliche
even for Captain Cold?
- Come on. We don't
have time for this!
- Err!
- Calm down, kid.
- Oh, please!
You'll chat it up with
the cops, with bystanders,
With cold even.
No. No way!
Today is the day!
- Today is the day.
- Welcome to the
hall of justice.
- Headquarters of
the Justice League.
- Oh, man!
I knew we'd be the
last ones here.
- Is that Batman?
- I see Flash and Flash jr.
- His name's Speedy. Duh.
- No. Speedy's
green arrow's sidekick.
- Well, that makes no sense.
- Ready to see
the inner sanctum?
- Born that way.
- I'm glad we're all here.
- Have all 4 sidekicks
ever been in the same place
At the same time?
- Don't call us
sidekicks, not after today.
- Sorry. First
time at the hall.
I'm a little overwhelmed.
- You're overwhelmed,
freeze was underwhelmed.
Why isn't anyone
ever just whelmed?
Oh. Maybe that's why.
- Robin, Speedy, Aqualad,
Kid Flash, welcome.
You now have unlimited access
to the gym, our fully stocked
Galley, and of
course our library.
- Make yourselves at home.
- Quick debrief to discuss the
coincidence of 4 ice villains
Attacking on the same day.
We shouldn't be long.
- Recognized: Batman, 0-2;
Aquaman, 0-6; Flash, 0-4;
Green Arrow, 0-8;
Martian Manhunter, 0-7;
Red Tornado, 1-6.
- That's it?
You promised us a real look
inside, not a glorified
Backstage pass.
- It's a first step.
You've been granted
access few others get.
- Oh, really?
Who cares which side of
the glass we're on?
- Roy, you just need
to be patient.
- What I need is respect.
They're treating us like kids.
Worse--like sidekicks!
We deserve better than this.
You're kidding, right?
You're playing their game?
Why? Because you
think they play fair?
Today was supposed to be the
day, step one in becoming
Full-fledged members
of The League.
- Well, sure, but I thought
step one was a tour of the hq.
- Except the hall isn't
The League's real hq.
I bet they never told you
it's just a false front
For tourists and a pit stop
for catching zeta beam
Teleporter tubes to the real
thing, an orbiting satellite
Called the watchtower.
- I know, I know, but I
thought maybe we could make
An exception.
Or not.
- You're not helping
your cause here, son.
Stand down or--
- Or what? You'll send
me to my room?
And I'm not your son!
I'm not even his.
I thought I was his
partner, but not anymore.
Guess they're
right about you 3.
You're not ready.
- Superman to Justice League.
There's been an explosion
at project Cadmus.
It's on fire.
- I've had my
suspicions about Cadmus.
This may present the
perfect opportunity to in--
- Zatara to Justice League.
The sorcerer wotan is using
the amulet of attan to blot
Out the sun.
Requesting full
League response.
- Superman?
- It's a small fire.
Local authorities have
it under control.
- Then Cadmus can wait.
All leaguers rendezvous
at Zatara's coordinates.
Batman out.
Stay put.
- What? Why?
- This is a League mission.
- You're not trained.
- Since when?
- I meant you're not trained
to work as part of this team.
- There will be other
missions when you're ready.
- But for now, stay put.
- Glad you didn't
bring you know who?
- Indeed.
- When we're ready?
How are we ever supposed to be
ready when they treat us like--
Like sidekicks?
- My mentor, my king, I
thought he trusted me.
- Trust? They don't even
trust us with the basics!
They've got a
secret hq in space!
- What else aren't
they telling us?
- I have a better question.
Why didn't we
leave with Speedy?
- What is project Cadmus?
- Don't know,
but I can find out.
- Access denied.
- Heh. Want to bet?
- Whoa! How are
you doing that?
- Same system as the batcave.
- Access granted.
- All right. Project Cadmus.
Genetics lab here in d.C.
That's all there is, but if
Batman's suspicious, maybe we
Should investigate.
- Solve their case
before they do.
It would be poetic justice.
- Hey. They're
all about justice.
- But they said stay put.
- For the blotting out the
sun mission, not this.
- Wait. Are you
going to Cadmus?
Because if you're
going, I'm going.
- Just like that we're
a team on a mission?
- We didn't come for
a play date.
- Help!
- Get us down!
- Stay put.
We will get you out.
- Ohh, ohh!
- It's what's his
name--Flash boy!
- Kid Flash! Why
is that so hard?
- So smooth.
- Does he always have
to run ahead?
We need a plan.
We--Robin?
- Ha ha ha!
- I need to borrow that.
Step aboard now.
- Ohh!
- Appreciate the help.
- You handled it.
Besides, we're here
to investigate.
Poetic justice, remember?
- There was something
in the--
- Elevators should
be locked down.
- This is wrong.
Thought so.
This is a high-speed
express elevator.
It doesn't belong in a
two-story building.
- Neither does what I saw.
Unh!
- And that's why they need
an express elevator.
I'm at the end of my rope.
Bypassing security.
There! Go!
Welcome to project Cadmus.
- Wait!
- Aah!
Ohh.
- No. Nothing odd
going on here.
- Dr. Desmond.
- Tell me, guardian, what part
of no interruptions did you
Not understand?
If you're here to tell me what
caused the street level fire,
It can wait.
- Fire department's
still cleaning up.
I'll begin my
investigation when they leave.
- Then what?
- A g-gnome on sub-level
- Ohh. Did I miss a
perimeter breach alert?
- No.
- Then the g-gnome's confused.
Whatever might occur in our
faux lab above ground,
The real Cadmus is the most
secure facility in d.C.
- My job to keep it that way.
- Fine. Take a squad.
- Might I recommend guardian
leave his g-gnome behind?
If violence should occur...
- The little guy would
be in my way.
- No. The advantage of instant
telepathic communication
Outweighs other concerns.
- I need my g-gnome with
me at all times.
- Ok. I'm officially whelmed.
- This is how they hid this
massive underground facility
From the world.
The real Cadmus
isn't on the grid.
It generates its own
power with these things.
Must be what they're bred for.
- Of course. Even the
name is a clue.
The Cadmus of myth created a
new race by sowing dragons'
Teeth into the earth.
- And this Cadmus
creates new life, too.
Let's find out why.
They call them genomorphs.
Whoa! Look at the stats on
these things--superstrength,
Telepathy, razor claws.
These are living weapons!
- They're engineering
an army, but for who?
- Wait. There's
something else.
Project Kr.
Ugh! The file's
triple-encrypted. I can't--
- Don't move!
Wait. Robin,
Aqualad, Kid Flash?
- At least he got
your name right.
- I know you.
Guardian, a hero.
- I do my best.
- Then what are
you doing here?
- I think that's
my question, boys.
I'm chief of security.
You're trespassing, but we
can call the Justice League,
Figure this out.
- You think The League's
gonna approve of you
Breeding weapons?
- Weapons? What are
you--what have I--ugh.
My head.
Take them down hard!
No mercy!
- Way to be a
team player, rob!
- Weren't you right behind me?
- We're headed down?
- Dude, out is up.
- Excuse me? Project Kr,
it's down on sub-level 52.
- This is out of control.
Perhaps--perhaps we
should contact The League.
- We are already here.
-
Which way?
- Yeah. Bizarre-looking
hallway one
Or bizarre-looking hallway two?
- Halt!
They are headed
for project Kr!
- Aah!
-
Hurry!
- I disabled the door.
We're safe.
- We're trapped.
- Uh, guys. You'll
want to see this.
- Whoa!
- Big "k," little "r," the
atomic symbol for krypton.
Clone?
- Robin, hack.
- Oh. Right, right.
Weapon designation Superboy,
a clone force-grown
In...16 weeks?
From DNA acquired
from Superman.
- Stolen from Superman.
- No way the big guy
knows about this.
- Solar suit allows him
to absorb yellow sun
Radiation 24/7.
- And these creatures?
- Genomorph gnomes,
telepathic, force-feeding him
An education.
- And we can guess what else.
They're making a slave out
of, well, Superman's son.
- Now we contact The League.
- No signal.
- We're in too deep literally.
- They're still in
there with the weapon?
- We can't get the door open.
- Use your telekinesis!
- I have tried to no avail.
- Useless. This is a debacle.
Get some g-trolls down here
to muscle the door open now!
- Already on their way.
- You realize once we get
in there we can't ever let
Them leave.
- Doc, these aren't your
typical meddling kids.
You don't want to get on
the wrong side
Of the Justice League.
- Better than getting on the
wrong since of the Cadmus
Board of directors, believe me.
Contact the
g-gnomes inside Kr.
- This is wrong.
- We can't leave
him like this.
- Set him free. Do it.
Unh!
- Whoa! Hang on, Supey.
- We're on your side.
- Ohh!
- I don't want to do this.
Unh!
- Enough!
-
- We are trying to help you.
- Aah!
- Attaboy.
- Dr. Desmond, you require
an audience with the light?
- Yes. Very sorry to disturb
you at this late hour.
- Just make your report.
- Of course. Ahem.
Well, we had a small fire
here at project Cadmus.
The origin of the incident is
still unclear, but it seems to
Have attracted some...
Unwanted attention.
Aqualad, and Kid Flash--
Breached security.
They found and released
the weapon, the Superboy.
Of course the clone is under
our telepathic control and as
Ordered turned against
his would-be liberators.
The 3 are contained, and we
don't believe The League knows
They're here.
Uh, what should I
do with them?
- Clone them.
The substitutes will serve
the light and only the light.
- And the originals?
- Dispose of them.
Leave no trace.
- Time runs short.
You must awaken.
You must awaken now!
- What? What do you want?
Quit staring.
You're creeping me out.
- Uh, KF, how about we not
tick off the guy who can fry
Us with a look?
- Prepare the cloning
procedure for the new project
Sidekick now.
- Almost done here, doc.
- Where's the weapon?
- Superboy? He carried
the intruders to
The cloning chamber.
- We have genomorphs for that!
Get the weapon back
in its pod now!
- I don't see the harm
in letting the kid
Stretch his legs.
- Don't you now?
- That clone
belongs in a cage!
- We only sought to help you.
- Yeah. We free you,
and you turn on us.
How's that for grat--
- Kid, please, be quiet now.
I believe our new friend
is not in full control
Of his actions.
- Wha--what if--
what if I wasn't?
- He can talk?
- Yes, he can.
- Not like I said, "it."
- The genomorphs taught
you telepathically.
- They taught me much.
I can read, write.
I know the names of things.
- But have you seen them?
Have they ever actually let
you see the sky or the sun?
- Images are implanted
in my mind, but no.
I have not seen them.
- Do you know what
you are, who you are?
- I am the Superboy, a
genomorph, a clone made from
The DNA of the Superman,
created to replace him should
He perish, to destroy him
should he turn from the light.
- To be like Superman is a
worthy aspiration, but like
Superman, you deserve a life
of your own beyond that
Solar suit, beyond your
pod, beyond Cadmus.
- I live because of Cadmus!
It is my home!
- Your home is a test tube.
We can show you the sun.
- Uh, pretty sure it's after
midnight, but we can show
You the moon.
- We can show you,
introduce you to Superman.
- No, they can't.
They'll be otherwise occupied.
Activate the cloning process.
- Pass. Batcave's
crowded enough.
- And get the weapon
back in its pod!
- Hey. How come he gets
to call Supey an it?
- Help us.
- Don't start thinking now.
See, you're not a real boy.
You're a weapon, and
you belong to me!
Well, to Cadmus. Same thing.
Now get back to your pod!
- Aah!
- Unh!
- Where's dubbilex?
Ooh! Lurking as usual.
Get the g-gnomes
downloading their memories.
When that's done and when
you're sure the clones are
Viable, delete the
source material.
- Superboy, you live.
That gives you the right
to follow your own path.
A weapon or a person, the
choice is yours, but ask
Yourself, "what
would Superman do?"
- I told you to get
back to your--
- Don't give me orders.
- You here to help
us or fry us?
- Huh. I don't seem to have
heat vision, so I suppose
Helping is my only option.
- Ahh. Finally!
Lucky Batman isn't here.
He'd have my head
for taking so long.
- Seriously, that's what
you're worried about?
The whole League will have
our heads after tonight.
- Free Aqualad.
I'll get kid mouth.
- Don't you give
me orders either.
- Thank you.
- You--you'll never
get out of here!
I'll have you back in
pods before morning.
- That guy is not whelmed,
not whelmed at all.
- What is it with you
and this whelmed thing?
- Activate every
genomorph in Cadmus.
- We are still 42 levels
below ground, but if we can
Make the elevator...
- Aah!
- Superboy, the goal
is escape, not to bury
Ourselves here.
- You want escape?
Aah!
I--I'm falling.
Superman can fly.
Why can't I fly?
- Don't know, but it looks
like you can leap tall
Buildings in a single bound.
Still cool.
- Thank you.
- Guys, this will have
to be our exit.
- Turn left, brother.
- Go left! Left!
- Turn right.
- Right!
- Great directions, Supey.
You trying to get us repodded?
- No. I don't understand.
- Don't apologize.
This is perfect!
- At this rate,
we'll never get out.
- Shh. Listen.
- Someone--Robin, I'd
wager--hacked our systems,
Deactivating internal security
cameras, but he neglected
The motion sensors.
The genomorphs are closing in.
They're all
coming out in here.
We have them cornered.
Ohh! He hacked the
motion sensors.
- I hacked the motion sensors.
- Sweet. Still plenty of
them between us and out.
- But I've finally
got room to move.
- More behind us.
- We'll cut them off
at sub-level 1.
- We'd better, or the board
will have our heads, my head.
I need to get something
from project Blockbuster
Just in case.
I'll meet you at sub-level 1.
- Oh, crud.
- We're cut off
from the street.
- Thanks. My head
hadn noticed.
- Can't hack this fast enough.
This way!
- Perhaps for the sake of
all genomorphs, our brother
Superboy should make
up his own mind.
- It was you.
- Yes, brother. I set the fire
and lured your new friends
Down into Cadmus, woke them
when they were in danger...
- And guided me. Why?
- Because you are our
hope, the genomorph hero.
You will blaze a trail for all
our brothers, showing us
The way to freedom.
- What's going on?
- What is your
choice, brother?
- I...Choose...Freedom.
- Feels like fog lifting.
- Guardian?
- Go. I'll deal with Desmond.
- I think not.
Project Blockbuster will give
me the power to restore order
To Cadmus.
-
- Everyone back!
Aah!
- Arrgh!
- Ok. That's one way to
bust through the ceiling.
- You think lab
coat planned that?
- I doubt he is planning
anything anymore.
-
- Learned that one
in kindergarten.
- Unh!
- Aah!
- Unh!
- Of course.
KF, get over here!
- Got it?
- Got it.
- Go!
- Got your nose.
- Superboy, Aqualad!
- Come and get me,
you incredible bulk!
Ohh!
- This one and that one.
- Sorry. Try again.
- Ha!
-
- Move!
-
- We did it.
- Was there ever any doubt?
- See? The moon.
Oh. And Superman.
Do we keep our
promises or what?
- Is that what I think it is?
- He doesn't like
being called an it.
- I'm Superman's clone.
- Start talking.
-
Well, uh--we'll figure
something out for you.
The League will, I mean.
For now, I'd better make sure
they get that Blockbuster
Creature squared away.
- Cadmus will be investigated,
all 52 levels, but let's make
One thing clear.
- You should have called.
- End results aside,
we are not happy.
You hacked Justice League
systems, disobeyed direct
Orders, and endangered lives.
You will not be
doing this again.
- I am sorry, but we will.
- Aqualad, stand down.
- Apologies, my king, but no.
We did good work here tonight,
the work you trained us to do.
Together on our own we forged
something powerful, important.
- If this is about your
treatment at the hall,
The 3 of you--
- The 4 of us, and it's not.
- Batman, we're ready to use
what you taught us, or why
Teach us at all?
- Why let them tell
us what to do?
It's simple.
Get on board or get
out of the way.
- This cave was the
original secret sanctuary
Of the Justice League.
We're calling it
into service again.
Since you 4 are determined
to stay together and fight
The good fight, you'll do
it on League terms.
Red Tornado volunteered
to live here and be
Your supervisor.
Black canary's in
charge of training.
I will deploy you on missions.
- Real missions?
- Yes, but covert.
- The League will still
handle the obvious stuff.
There's a reason we have these
big targets on our chests.
- But Cadmus proves the bad
guys are getting smarter.
Batman needs a team that
can operate on the sly.
- The 5 of you will
be that team.
- Cool! Wait. 5?
- This is the Martian
Manhunter's niece
Miss Martian.
- Hi.
- Liking this gig
more every minute.
Welcome aboard. I'm Kid Flash.
That's Robin, Aqualad.
It's cool if you
forget their names.
- I'm honored to be included.
- Hey, Superboy.
Come meet miss M.
- I like your t-shirt.
- Today is the day.
- Cadmus changes today.
With Desmond out of the
picture, the board's placed me
In charge.
Dr. Spence, you're
acting chief scientist.
No more g-gnomes suppressing
our wills, no more secret
Breeding projects.
This is a kinder,
gentler Cadmus.
- Then I will of course help
in any way I can, brother.
- Can the light afford to
leave guardian in charge
Without the g-gnomes?
- We have subtler
means of control.
What concerns me
is the children.
We now know The League is
willing to employ young heroes
To do their dirty work.
That's a dark twist.
- Yes, but one that can be
played to our advantage.
Even the temporary loss of
the weapon may prove useful.
Eventually everyone
sees the light.
