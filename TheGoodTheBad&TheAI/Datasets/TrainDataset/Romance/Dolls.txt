BANDAI VISUAL, TOKYO FM
TV TOKYO and OFFICE KITANO
a TAKESHI KITANO film
We re ready.
It's time. Here goes.
"I beg you. Calm thyself.
Rashness will come to no good."
"Thou hast become enslaved
to such a miserable state of mind."
"Who hast led thee to such a state?"
"God have mercy. It Is none other than I."
"I, Umekawa, is all to be blamed."
"Shall I be thankful to thee?"
"Or shall I pity thee?"
"Read thou my heart." She beguiled him.
The tears she shed
fell on the gold coins.
And her tears shone like globeflowers
covered by dew.
It was indeed a sight,
which drew forth
pity from one's heart.
All the gold Chubei spent
was not his to possess.
Thus, glory was ephemeral.
A way they fled
to yonder and beyond
where their feet guided them.

The leashed beggars.
Leashed beggars!
Well, hello.
Hi.
So, Matsumoto's bride isn't Sawako.
Evidently not.
When I got the invitation,
I thought they finally got hitched
but I was wrong.
He's marrying
our company president s daughter.
You're kidding.
The family seems to like him.
So, he's a Cinderella boy.
He's now a way ahead of us.
Whatever happened to Sawako?
Must have broken up nicely.
Never thought Matsumoto was such a guy.
Why not take the opportunity?
Yeah, the shortcut to success.
In 2 years, we'll have to
speak politely to him.
The president is kind enough to...
I'm already engaged.
Forget her. You re not married yet.
Think about your life.
Your father worked hard,
but with little success,
because he's not a college graduate.
Why do you think
he made you go to college?
Think it over.
It s about your life.
This is a great opportunity.
You must know that.
I can't leave her.
We II go and apologize to her.
We'll beg her... do anything.
What?
Congratulations.
I'm happy for you.
Excuse me, sir.
You have a visitor.
She says she's Sawako's friend.
Hey.
What's up?
An old friend's here.
Forgot to invite him.
I see.
So, you chose success?
Sawako chose suicide.
She died?
No, she survived, but not completely.
She lost her sanity.
Doesn't even recognize me.
She s as good as dead.
Where is she now?
Hospital.
Which one?
She won't recognize you.
Sawako chose suicide.
She won't recognize you.
It's delicious.
You can have more.
Whatever happened to him?
Heard he took off.
What about the wedding?
I guess it値l be cancelled.
Okay, collect the trash.
Put the trash in here. Okay.
Still some over there.
Why the hell did you
take off from the wedding?
The bride was in tears,
and the president was furious.
Can you lend me money?
What are you...
Whatever you have now.
What do you plan to do?
Better apologize quickly
or you'll be doomed.
Thanks a million.
I'll get in touch with you soon.
Hey, Matsumoto.
Where did you come from?
What s your name?
Sir... Your lady seems to be...
Don稚 leave the room by yourself.
You値l give trouble to the hotel.
I値l take care of everything.
Hello.
Yes... I understand...
Sorry, sorry.
Give them to me.
Yeah...
I know...
...But Sawako
isn't feeling so great.
I heard.
They say she's lost her mind.
Is it true?
Hello? . . Hello?
Hello?
Hey, Matsumoto.
Are you from around here?
Where do you live?
Is anything the matter?
You know her?
Yes.
Can you pay for them?
Let me...
Come on...
Let me see them.
Do you want to try that out?
Go ahead. Open it and try it.
Wait... Let me.
Like this.
Let me. You blow it... Like this.
It's cold. Let's go in.
You'll catch cold.
Here.
Watch out, you morons.
What s wrong with you?
I'll buy you a new one.
Forgive me.
Boss, it's done.
We've finished loading.
Thank you very much.
We appreciate it.
We II be off then.
It was his choice.
Boss.
He II be guarding you.
I m Ikeuchi, sir. I'm starting today.
Is your mother well?
Yeah.
I see.
Yeah... Hey.
Thank you.
- Say hello to her.
- Sure.
That's my  brother's son.
What's with those guys? Some weirdos.
Excuse me.
Where did you say you came from?
The Takigawa Family, sir.
OH, yeah... In Hiroshima, right?
How long have you been with us?
Is that right?
Not easy, is it?
Why did you become a yakuza?
When I was a kid,
I used to fight all the time.
Became a yakuza, because I was bad.
Being strong in fights
doesn't mean anything nowadays.
Better use your head.
Being tough did mean something
...in the good ol' days.
After you ice him,
stay away from my place.
You have to kill even
your  brother at times.
Go ahead.
Brother, you're killing me, too?
Sorry about it.
Do it.
Too bad... We were really close.
The doctor s here.
Oh, okay.
Damn quack. I can稚 tell
whether I'm getting better or worse.
He never says anything straight.
Maybe I haven't got
much time ahead of me.
Are you single?
No woman?
Not now.
How come?
Because women get in our way.
So you're an old fashioned chap, huh?
Am I?
I used to be like you.
It's me.
You surprised me.
Here. I made lunch for you, too.
Wow. This is terrific.
Will you eat it?
I will.
Here.
Thank you.
It certainly looks good.
How is it?
It's delicious.
I'm glad.
I'm going out...
Yes, sir.
Take me to Saitama.
Sir?
Today's Saturday, right?
Yes.
Brought them from the shop.
Won't they be angry?
No, these were left over.
Next Saturday, I値l make the lunches.
I might not be able to come next week.
Are you busy?
Yes... Well, no...
I'm thinking of quitting work.
Not much work at the factory
and it may go bankrupt.
I think I'll do the owner
a favor by quitting early.
He's a great guy,
and can稚 tell me to quit.
I see.
I'll find a more worthwhile job.
The way I am now,
I can't make you happy.
Being half-assed isn't good,
so it might be better
to be alone for a while.
So, don't care about me, Ryoko,
and go your own way.
I'll come see you when I'm ready.
When I come I'll be dressed well, too.
You'll be surprised that
I've made something of myself.
Well, I'll be going.
See you.
Hiro!
I'll wait for you.
I値l make lunch,
and be here every Saturday.
I値l make lunch and wait for you.
I値l make lunch,
and be here every Saturday.
I値l make lunch and wait for you.
Wait here.
Yes, sir.
What is this place?
Don't ask me such things.
Sorry.
The woman in question.
Who?
She comes here every Saturday
at noon with 2 box-lunches
and waits for her beau.
Excuse me. May we sit here?
I'm sorry. I promised to eat lunch
with my boyfriend here.
Can you keep it vacant?
Hey, there hasn't been any hit.
Sorry, sir.
How come there's no hit here?
Sorry, sir.
Forget the sorry, sir
Hey, did you put bait on my line?
Yes, tangerine.
Tangerine?
Yes, sir.
Tangerine as bait?
Yes, sir.
For fish?
Yes, sir.
How can you catch fish
with tangerine, you moron?
This is ridiculous. Let s go.
