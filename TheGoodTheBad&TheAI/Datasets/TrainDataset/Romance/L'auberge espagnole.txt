Everything started here
when my plane took off.
No, it's not about a take-off
The beginning is here.
I had an appointment
with Mr Jean-Charles Perrin.
It starts where it should ends.
Good morning, I have an appointment
with Mr Jean-Charles Perrin
You'll find him in the building F
Good morning, I have an appointment
with Mr Jean-Charles Perrin
Somebody for Mr Perrin
Good morning
Good morning, I have an appointment
with Mr Jean-Charles Perrin
OK, please follow me
Ah Xavier
Good morning Mr Perrin
Call me Jean-Charles
You can't know how happy I am
to see you
Come in
See, that's where I work
view of Paris...the Eiffel tower
I've known your father since...
at that time we were together
at the Administration School
I remember it was in...
My father is somebody
who can understand that
Meet him, you've nothing to loose,
he's very nice I've known him for...pfff...
This is my father
It's just in your branch
You love the Double Malt
you know this one it's scotish,
it's marvellous
In fact, everything started
here when he said :
The only thing I know is that
with the new european directives
some jobs will be created in one year
if you make a post-graduate
about a subject
that talks about the economic issues
in Spain
I might be able to help you find a job.
There are some openings.
but you must speak spanish
and know the spanish market.
Hablas español ?
Well...un poquito
Do you know Spain ?!
well...I know Ibiza...
Then I decided to leave
one year for Spain
When I was a kid, I was blond
and I wanted to be a writer.
And then I changed...
changes happen...
My mother, to make fast, is a hippy.
A real one.
And the problem with real hippies
is that they always tell the truth
You don't like bulghur,
you don't like tofu.
I cannot cook anymore for you.
If you prefer to go in the fast-food
and eat their shit
To wolf down GMO, pesticides,
prions and co...
Before I wasn't sure but
now thinking about it,
I told myself I needed to go.
España
I had to gather information about
european university exchanges.
It's called ERASMUS.
And it's a fucking mess...
Please wait !
You wonder who Erasmus is.
I looked on Internet because I didn't know too
and honestly I didn't get everything.
To be quick, I think he was a kind of
dutch traveller around 1500
To register for my post-graduate in Spain,
it took me 3 months
It's in the office next door.
Have you seen my colleague next door ?
I've just been there.
Good morning it's for
an ERASMUS form
Do you have your registration card ?
I've just got it.
But, nothing is filled on this.
What do you want me to do with that ?
But I've just got it now, they had lost
my file, I have to fill another one.
Of course, you're really all the same.
Always filling the forms at the last
moment when it needs a lot of papers...
I've done it but they've lost my file,
it's not my fault if they lose the files.
I just wanted to know what papers do
I need...
for the file...
to be complete.
For a Erasmus file,
for a post-graduate,
it's easy,
you should know it's written
on the card inside the file.
You need agreement of
your research director here.
You need agreement and signature
of your research director there.
You need the agreement of
the university there.
You need the agreement of
this university.
Your student health insurance card,
you have to give it to me.
Are you SMEREP or MNEF ?
MNEF
Ok then you have to go at the MNEF
office, building D ground floor
to obtain the form E111.
Don't 'pfffff'.
If you don't have this document,
you won't be able
to get your medical fee
and medecine costs back
when you'll be there.
OK, fill all these.
And after of course, like other files,
a resume, a covering letter, name of your
post-graduate diploma and that's it.
I don't know why the world
has become such a mess.
I don't know if it's compulsory
that the world become like that.
Everything is complicated,
badly-made, untidy.
Before there were fields
with cows and chickens.
Everything was more simple I think.
Before we had a direct contact
with things.
In the world of Martine, we had animals.
We ate what we grew.
We built our clothes, our house.
In the farm, the life was
simple for Martine.
Sometimes I wonder why we have
left the world of Martine.
It's horrible, no ?
Why is it horrible ?
Look how sexist it is !
See the vision of the woman they give.
Bah no why ?
You say that because she gives seeds to chickens
and because she milk cows ?
No but of course,
anyway it's your fantasy.
The little nice girl with the
small skirt and the cheeks all red.
Bah no.
When I think that my parents
called me Martine because of her.
I'm freakin out.
My mum read that
when she was young.
It's rather cute I think.
Martine.
It's not important.
It's because of Martine that you...
I'm sad that you're leaving.
I'm sad too.
Yes ?
Shit.
Wait Martine.
OK then.
She's sad no ?
Of course.
I'm sad too you know.
You're sure it's good to go ?
Are you crazy mum,
what are you doing ?
It's not your father's ideas...
Mum ! No, it's not my father's ideas...
I've decided to go,
my plane's leaving in 5 minutes.
I don't want to talk about that now.
I'm sad too you know.
Everybody's sad.
It doesn't seem like.
Don't cry.
We'll see each other soon.
Don't cry Martine.
Don't worry everything will be fine.
Xavier, are you sure about
what you're doing ?
Shut up mum !
Do you want something to drink ?
Erasmus ?
What are you studying ?
Economy.
Wow serious, market and all that stuff.
Yeah sort of.
Do you know Barcelona ?
No actually i've just arrived.
I can tell you, you're going to enjoy it.
- Really ?
- Really.
You'll see, excellent.
Bye.
This guy had the face of the guys
I usually try to avoid.
And I don't know why,
he absolutely wanted to talk to me.
You'll see, it's a crazy city.
People start to go to the restaurant at 10pm.
Before, there no one in the restaurants.
After, they started the party !
You have to know the Barcelonians love to party.
- Have you heard about the 'barres de copas' ?
- No.
I'm not telling you, you'll see.
When coming to make Erasmus you have to cling.
You won't sleep a lot, you'll see.
And you come to do what ?
I'm a doctor, I've got an important job
at the Hopital del Mar.
I'm a neurologist.
And you ?
We got married 2 weeks ago, she doesn't
know yet what she's going to do.
First, she's going to take
some courses to learn spanish.
You don't speak spanish at all?
And you, you speak spanish ?
Hablas español ?
A little yes.
I'm here to make a post-graduate
diploma at the Barcelona university.
When arriving in a city,
we see streets in perspective.
Sequences of buildings with no meaning.
Everything is unknown, virgin.
Please, street...
'carrer des escudellers blancs'
Pardon ?
I think it's at the end on the left, straight.
- There ?
- Yes there
- OK thanks
Later we'll have lived in this city.
We'll have walked in its streets.
We'll have been to the end of the perspectives.
We'll have seen all the buildings.
We'll have lived stories with people.
When we'll have lived in this city,
we'll have taken this street
After a moment, everything belongs
to you because you've lived there.
It was to happen but I didn't know it yet.
Urquinaona
This thing that sounds weird was added
to the long list of old weird names
that we have somewhere in our brain.
Urquinaona, slightly slipped next to
Mouffetard, Bondoufle, Ponteaux-Combault
Marolles-en-Hurepoix, Mandelieu-La Napoule
and Knok le Zout.
He becomes normal and familiar.
After, long after, when we are back in Paris
every hard time has become
an extraordinary adventure.
There is always this stupid stuff
or the worst days of a journey.
The most missed experiences are those
that we talk about most.
- The bell doesn't work
- What ?
- It doesn't work
Who are you searching for ?
- A girl whose name is...Sonia Miralpeix.
I am Xavier
Is it possible...the door.
One moment, I open it.
The only plan I had to sleep
a few days in Barcelona
was from a friend of my mother,
whom, of course, I didn't know.
Some more coffee ?
Your plane was late ?
It's better.
This guy who was from chili, has a niece who lives in Barcelona.
and who told him I could stay while searching for an appartment.
But I could not stay long in this flat
because she lived at her grand-father's
and that it was complicated.
It was complicated for me to stay long.
It was already complicated before I came but,
now I was in a typical shitty plan of my mother.
Never listen to her again,
never follow her plans again.
Thanks mum, never listen to her again...
Never follow her lousy plans.
Hi, Jean-Michel.
Good morning it's Xavier.
We've seen each other at the airport.
OK.
You see who I am.
I'm embarassed.
I feel confused to call you like that.
No, no, just some guys who...
As you told me that you could...
It's very nice.
And I don't remember who's dead
but anyway now she's in Chili,
and she just forgot to tell me
that it won't be possible for me.
Listen, honestly, honestly no problem.
I told you.
For us it's the same we've just arrived
so anyway it will be without any fuss.
Make yourself at home.
I know what it is, it was the same
when I arrived here the first time.
Between French people,
we should help each other, right ?
You can sleep on the sofa.
Anne-So is going to cook you something.
Yes
Are you hungry ?
Yes
I don't have many things to offer.
I can cook....rice...or pasta.
And to go with...we don't even
have butter but oil.
Of course, very good, pasta with olive oil.
Come on.
Sorry, it was hard not to wake you up.
No, no, no ok, no problem.
Would you like some coffee ?
Why not.
At first, it seems like a complexe architecture
but in fact the functioning
of the brain is quite simple.
OK here is the cortex.
Like this with the 2 hemispheres.
And the memory area
takes place in the hippocampus
and in the internal part of the temporal lobes.
Of course I summarize...
My speciality is to study everything about the relations
between this area of the brain
which is more or less related to the memory
and this area that manage the language.
We have discovered some extraordinary diseases.
For example, somebody who is bilingual
can have an amnesia which affects
only one of the 2 languages he knows.
So suddenly because of some traumatism
he knows only his mother tongue.
Nothing more about the second language
he learnt.
Erased from the hard-drive.
Well done no?
I've seen your classified in the newspaper.
Yes for the flat.
I want to share.
'Compartir', tio.
Compartido.
To find a flat in Barcelona, it's a real story.
Is it OK for you ?
More or less 1000 euros.
Yes, it's good.
-Sure ? 50 000 the first month.
-I'll see.
Because we thought about selling.
- The first month, otherwise...
- OK.
My job has started very quickly, I have to go
Can I ask you a favor Xav ?
Of course, no problem
Can I ask you to go out with Anne-So ?
She's afraid of going out alone.
As I know you speak a little bit of spanish...
Yes, yes, no problem
I saw you crying in the plane.
You looked so sad.
It made me sad too.
Yes, we say to ourselves
that we're happy to go
that we're strong.
But once in the air, well I wondered...
It's not easy to leave like that,
we leave so much behind.
We don't know exactly where we're going
Yeah
It's a strange mix.
Same for me, I'm so happy with Jean-Michel
I really wanted to follow him,
live something great with him.
And at the same time, I'm scared.
Change your life.
Learn a new language.
I feel like at the bottom of a huge mountain
I needed to write to Martine regularly.
I started to write things
I would never have told her
if she had been in front of me.
I had always been shy but being
far away from her made me talk more.
And at the end, I was closer to her.
Sometimes for the share flats
you had to go through a real exam.
Moreover, I speak french.
I lived one year in Paris.
It's not always like this,you see...
Instantly, I loved this place.
I would have give anything to be accepted here.
The mess that lived here, looked like the one
that lived inside me since always.
It's as if theirs slanging matches were those
that take place in my head since I'm a child.
The courses had started, I still didn't have a flat.
Goodbye Anne-Sophie
Fuck, I really don't understand
the course in catalan.
And you, you understand ?
It's not possible, somebody has to ask him.
"Speak castilian"
Who asks him ?
Are you student in french ?
Are you from the french course ?
Who ?
You.
OK. Good morning everyone.
I'm going to talk about the future
of the world capitalism.
- Please sir.
- Yes.
Could you make the course in catilian ?
Sorry, it's impossible.
The majority of students are catalan.
They don't have to change their language.
We are 15 ERASMUS students
who don't speak catalan.
And you speak spanish.
I understand you perfectly miss
but understand me too.
We are in Catalonia and the catalan
is the official language.
For spanish, go to Madrid or
in South America.
Let's continue.
I'm going to talk about the future
of the world capitalism.
What can we say about world capitalism ?
What I liked with this girl
is that she didn't fit with economy.
I wondered what she was doing here.
Exactly like I always asked  myself,
what I was doing here.
In the beginning, there was
only one currency : gold.
I speak catalan because I am catalan
and because I live in Catalonia.
I find it contradictory to defend catalan
while we are building Europe
I don't agree.
First because...we're talking about identities.
There's not just one valid identity,
but several compatible identities.
It's a matter of respect.
Me, for example, I have at least 2 identities.
The gambian identity, that I carry inside of me
and the catalan identity.
It's not contradictory to combine both.
You, you're french, not martian.
You are french
and you keep your french identity.
Do you understand me ?
I give you my 'pan tumaca'
I give you my...my Dali.
Spain is not only 'Ole'
Not only flamenco. It's a lot of things
including catalan.
It must be vey destabilizing
to be always between 2 languages
Isn't it the same problem in Belgium
with the flemish and walloon ?
Walloon, no it's not the same
For example, I am walloon,
I don't speak flemish
When I am in Flandres, I say I'm french
It's good, super good.
Brilliant !
Then if they understand I'm walloon...
Tomorrow ?
That's brilliant, I've found a flat
Cool
Yes, so...OK
I have shitty room in the house of the mother
of the woman that hires me.
What are you doing ?
Au pair girl - babysitter
Brilliant !
Yeah brilliant
It's brilliant for you
Yes, it's brilliant for me...
I'm sad that you're leaving.
I want to write books.
What is it ?
The Spanish Inn
L'auberge espagnole.
This house was literally a spanish inn.
Wait
"Reading is like spanish inns,
we find what we bring in it." Maurois
It's a little bit complicated
to explain how it works.
But if I summarize, it's more or less like that :
I start with the phone to explain.
No, no, the fridge.
You come soon to see me.
I can't really talk to you now.
But i'm not alone, that's why.
We went out yesterday already, I'm broken.
Not at all but...but it's not one person
there are 5 people behind me.
Listen we're not going to argue on the phone.
It's ridiculous.
You're coming soon to see me.
I want to see you.
Of course.
I love you too.
Kisses.
Xavier is not here, he's coming back tonight.
Xavier is not here, he's coming back tonight.
Isn't it beautiful ?
How was it this afternoon ?
Very good.
Where did you two meet ?
In Dinat.
In a pizzeria.
We used to go there every day.
There was a typic italian chef.
"Today I propose you melon,
very good ham, bonnissimo !"
He said that all the time ?
Everyday during 2 weeks.
Everyday...
Yeah I was working in the hopital
nearby and Anne-Sophie...
Go on, tell him.
No, go on, you tell.
Come on, tell him, Anne-So !
Why were you going to
this restaurant everyday ?
No.
Come one, don't be shy !
Go on, tell him !
No, I feel ashamed.
Don't make such a fuss
what bothers you ?
It's juste intimate, I don't want to tell.
Come on !
Wait it's not important.
She doesn't have to...if she doesn't want.
Fuck Anne-So tell him now !
He's right it's not important !
Get out of your shell baby !
The first time I saw Jean-Michel
at the first sight, I told myself I was in love.
Like that, instantly.
Completely mad about me !
I saw him and I told myself
"It's my husband."
'Love at first' sight, a real one.
You're impossible...
Shit ! Again !
Yes ?
Can I call you back ? At 8 ? OK.
They really piss me off !
Don't get angry Wendy.
- Hello.
- Hello Mr Cucurull
-I'm coming to show around the flat.
- Why ?
I don't speak to you.
Bicycles right in the middle...
We'll have to repaint.
Come in.
My God, the cupboard of my grand-mother !
The living rom.
And the Virgin ?
There was a Virgin here. Where is it ?
It's...elsewhere.
What a shambles !
You have to leave before the 1st of March.
Sorry. I'll take you back to the door.
It was a pleasure.
Can you give a reason ?
I don't want anymore students here.
- Why ?
- Look at the state of the flat !
I didn't finish to wash up.
But Lars and Soledad hadn't finished to eat.
I went to watch the TV
and when I was back you'd done everything.
I was about to do it but you're fussy.
What ? I don't want to live in a pigsty.
I am not fussy !
We are young, OK, but responsible.
OK you seem serious.
Starting from the next month, i'll talk to you.
And the rent is now 180,000 pesetas.
We have to take somebody else.
I know a very nice person
from my economy course.
- Who is it ?
- A girl...
very serious.
Anyway, I speak french.
I spent one year in Paris last year.
I'll call you.
You don't like her ?
If we can find better...
Unbelievable, you have a lot of stuffs I have.
You've got that CD too.
You too ?
What are you doing tomorrow ?
My friend Sabine is coming from Belgium.
Cool.
Hi.
Sabine.
Xavier.
Hi.
I really miss you.
It's not because I'm at the beach
that I don't miss you.
Tomorrow it's Sunday we've decided
to go to Sitges.
It's an other beach nearby.
No. Now I am at the beach
but in Barcelona.
Sitges is another beach.
I don't know, it must be different,
another beach.
With the french couple,
you know I told you.
The ones I've met in the plane
and who hosted me.
Well, cool no, but they are very nice.
Is France this way ?
No, rather this way.
We wouldn't have seen each other a lot.
Bah no.
Bye.
Hi everyone !
You want...
And you slept in the same bed ?
Bah yes.
In this one.
Yeah.
Why are you laughing ?
She's my friend.
Did you make some 'stuffs' ?
Xavier, yes, we made some 'stuffs',
she's my girlfriend.
A woman, I am lesbian.
And you ? When is yours coming ?
Mine...she's coming...soon.
She has some stuffs to finish and...
She's having a lot of problems.
Good luck then.
Women are crazy, trust me.
I hope it's good.
I changed my recipe.
What is it ?
A 'grattin dauphinois'.
- It's like a tortilla...
- I love tortilla !
It's not a tortilla.
There's no eggs.
It breaks my eggs, tortillas without eggs.
I am here honey.
Wendy, we're here.
We're coming.
Here we are.
Ola.
How are you ?
This way.
Join them if you want.
No, no, no way.
She is not a little stupid the English ?
Not at all, she's very cool.
Wait, she's very uptight.
She has a guy ?
Yes, she has.And she not uptight
at all.
Anyway, they managed to give you
the most shitty room.
It's not shitty !
And anyway, I won't stay long
we change in 2 months.
You've decided to annoy me, that's it ?
No, but you described it
as the dream place.
And honestly...
your room is really shabby.
Look at the wallpaper.
Sorry, but I can't here like that.
It's OK.
I need us to get back together a little.
It's OK, I understand.
And with the others nearby.
Are you upset ?
No, I told you I understand.
It's OK.
But I know we don't have much time together.
The 'Everything should be great' stuff,
it's worrying me.
It's dumb...
Please stop. I'm telling you it's OK.
I had the feeling that we spent
more time saying goodbye
than seeing each others.
Love sucks.
I find it hard.
Yeah.
I love her though.
But here...
Same for me.
Sabine left in a bad mood.
It's right that...
What ?
I made a mistake by telling
somebody flirted with me.
Really ? Who ?
A guy ?
No !
My flamenco teacher.
It was during her course.
She made again a demo, you see.
She was...
so beautiful.
I had shivers.
She was staring at me.
Then she came near me.
More and more.
Softer.
At the end, she was really hard with me.
She was slapping my butt.
Move your hips !
Make a curve.
She was squeezing me against her.
Then she turned me.
I could do nothing, I was...
paralized.
She was totally dominating me.
And then ?
It was good.
She kissed me.
Fuck ! And you said that to...
to Sabine
Not like this.
Ah OK.
No.
You work too much.
Do you want something to drink ?
Nothing thanks.
Come on, it's for me.
You spend the day here, with one half-pint...
Let me pay you a drink.
What ?
Where are you from ?
France.
ERASMUS ?
- When did you arrive ?
- 2 month ago.
Shit, yes, 2 months.
You spend too much time at the university.
You should come more often.
It's here that you'll learn
what's important in Barcelona.
Leave him alone. He doesn't want
to hear your stupidities.
I teach him spanish.
What's your name ?
Do you know what is a "French" ?
A "French" ?
Come more often,
I'll teach you the spanish
'de puta madre' in 2 months.
'Puta madre'.
He'll never come back.
After few months, thanks to Juan, I started
to speak a spanish 'de puta madre'.
So, I was always coming to Juan
and Neus's bar.
My friend Xavier ! How are you doing ?
- What's going on ?
- We're having a little party.
- Hi Xavier.
- How are you, Neus ?
Xavier didn't tell me you were so beautiful.
He hid you well, bastard !
What did he say ?
He said...
he welcomed you in his cafe.
- Exactly !
- Asshole !
Let's dance.
Hi, my love !
But you said you'll come back !
But wait...
I don't have enough money, I told that
but I don't have enough money.
Me too I didn't have any money,
when I came, I managed to do it.
Really you don't care actually.
I do care.
Yes, every time you promise something,
you can't keep it.
I don't trust you anymore.
For my birthday, it's really lousy.
Where are you ? At the beach again ?
No, I am in Barcelona, in the street.
The music...I am in front of a cafe,
there's music everywhere, stop it !
It stinks no ?
It's a pity that Barcelona is such a dirty city.
Not more than Paris I think.
Yes of course it is.
There are  a lot of places here
that look like the Third World.
I know a lot of places in Paris
that look like the Third World too.
But I'm not surprised
that you don't know them.
You think I am uptight, right ?
No.
Yes, I can imagine what you think.
You think : "Poor girl, she's totaly uptight"
No, it's not true.
You think I am old-fashionned.
A little yes.
You are not really 'Juanita banana'
What is that ?
Let's say you're not really rock n' roll,
but you know it.
Yes I know it.
Does it bother you ?
No.
It bothers me.
I am not dumb you know, Xavier.
You, you're so at ease.
Everywhere.
All the time.
You pick up spanish in a few months.
You're intimate with everyone.
But I cannot.
I didn't have your education.
I am not as casual.
I know that here, you have to be cool.
But I'm not cool,
rock n' roll as you say.
Listen, it's not that important.
It's not a reason to say that Barcelona
and its inhabitants are dirty.
It's not being 'not rock n' roll',
it's just racism.
- It's racism ?
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to offend you.
It's not about offending me !
You're no more in France now,
it's been 6 months that you're here.
You should look around yourself.
I look around...You are so horrid to me...
Hi, Anne-Sophie.
It's Xavier.
Yes.
