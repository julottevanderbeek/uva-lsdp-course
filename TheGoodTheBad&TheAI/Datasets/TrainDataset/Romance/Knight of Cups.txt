The Pilgrim's Progress.
From this World to That Which is to Come,
Wherein is Discovered,
The Manner of His Setting Out,
As I walked through
the wilderness of this world,
I lighted on a certain place
where was a den
standing in a certain place with
his face from his own house
book in his hand,
and a great burden upon his back.
Remember the story
I used to tell you when you were a boy...
the people poured him a cup
that took away his memory.
I'm asking for your permission to make this
a dramatic scene for one second...
You have nice eyes.
Aren't I lucky.
Where do you live?
Why do ya wanna know?
I want to write you a letter.
What are you gonna say in your letter?
Maybe you better not say it.
Let's live
like nobody is ever done it before.
Once the soul
was perfect and had wings...
Brave.
it could soar into heaven
where only creatures with wings can be.
But the soul lost its wings
and fell to Earth.
And the nature of wings is to try to raise
the earthbound body
the soul remembers the beauty
it used to know in heaven.
And wings begin to spout,
and that makes the soul want to fly,
but it cannot yet.
It is still too weak.
So the man keeps staring up
into the sky like a young bird.
He has lost
all interest in the world...
-  Can I come over?
-  We just left each other.
On my phone sheet, I got agent
writers up my ass trying to get this job.
I just want to sit next to you.
Teddy thinks
you're the guy for this.
That means the assignment
you didn't turn in, right,
you don't have to worry about it.
Here's what happens. That goes away.
-  What are you wearing?
-  A dress.
- What's it made of?
- How should I know?
We said there's no way you're gonna do it.
So what'd we do? Said, double your quote.
And he did it.
And that, Chuck signed off of that.
Teddy gets who he wants.
The biggest comedy star wants you.
Five years ago you came to me and
wanted to write big movies in Hollywood.
- I mean...
- Okay, I don't want to see.
Moments like this
don't come along, okay? This is it.
I think you're weak.
Am I bringing you back to life?
We're not leading the lives
that we are meant for.
We're meant for something else.
My brother will translate.
He looks around.
He walks near the edge of the cliff.
She says, like shadows.
Your wrists were taped up
like a tennis player's.
You walked around
like nothing had happened.
You were always doing it,
pretending everything was okay.
- That's my brother, Rick.
- How are ya?
What's goin' on, now? Anything.
Same today?
Don't know how many times
I thought I'd die right here on the street.
I picked him up and I had him
in my car, and a cop pulled us over.
I tell him, "I'm a Methodist minister
and I'm looking after you, alright?"
And I got off.
I dreamed that we were caught in
a huge tidal wave that engulfed the city.
Any moment I! seemed like
we might be swept under.
There was a door
that I was afraid to go through.
- I touched the knob...
-  If I stuck you with a fork,
Like gain' out on the Snake River together.
Remember?
It's good of you to invite me out here.
Show me what it's like
to live a normal life.
Somethin' wrong?
What's up?
I can tell when somethin's wrong, man.
I know you.
What do you wanna talk about?
I'm the only brother you got left.
You can tell me.
I tell you stuff.
For destroying everything
I'd been trying to do.
I remember when they were putting Billy
in the ground, Dad went into hysterics.
"My son!"
Who fucking does that?
Oh, right now. Come on.
I gotta feel something.
Come on, feel it.
Ah, look at the fierce one.
The fierceness in his eyes. The rage!
inflicted upon myself...
-  Say it.
-  Serious information.
I did every lousy, crappy job
that they wanted me to do.
But because I stumbled down
the road like a drunk...
The light's gone out of your eyes.
Angela...
Frita...
Music is very important.
Helps me to fall in love.
Your face was very familiar to me, but I
didn't know from where. You're fantastic.
Thank you.
Listening to music on headsets, unaware you
are staring at them like a dirty ol' man.
I never stopped loving them.
But the way I loved them changed.
Sometimes you want raspberry, then
after a while you want some strawberry.
- It's Abrasive.
- Oh, you are such a governor.
- What's your name?
- Helen.
What's your name?
Rick.
Do you know anybody here?
No. Does that surprise you?
- I know a guy.
- I know a guy...
- like future space.
-  You're at a party, it's alright.
You know who'd be hot?
Cleopatra.
If her nose had been this much shorter,
it would've changed the world.
What about pink?
Do you like pink?
-  I love the company of women.
-  It's pretty. Did it lake long?
Some men don't like pink.
-  But closer.
-  Now you tell me something.
Treat this world as it deserves.
Smoke machines in an empty sea.
What can run but never walk,
some word have I found but never talk.
Ge! up.
There's a ketamine party we're having
next week. Have you ever heard of that?
You're here for 20 seconds and then,
wham, you're out. You're in another room.
Your wife. You're in another one.
You oughtta do that.
Have you been to Sarajevo?
I have prayed, man,
for God to take my arm, take both arms.
I felt so useless.
What's your name?
Dear friend.
In love with the world,
in love with love.
You always wanted to get away.
I wanted a mate.
Are you sorry that you brought me here?
Are you sorry you came?
Do you remember how happy we were?
Different these days.
What's going on with you?
You used to sing in the morning
coming down the stairs.
I meant to make you happy.
I wanted nothing else.
But then you began to be angry with me...
just for little things.
I don't wanna accuse you,
bu! you turned more unkind toward me.
Just don't threaten me with leaving, okay?
Just do what you wanna do!
Just go!
Have you.
Mine.
Are you sorry
we didn't have babies?
You wanted me to help you
through the dangers of a young man's life.
When was the last time
you took these boots off?
I think you were afraid
of going astray.
Your head was turned
in the wrong direction.
Can you move all your fingers?
Yeah, they look a little bit bruised.
You never really wanted
to be totally inside our marriage.
My
Drinking is bad.
Bu! feelings are worse.
Sober girls are the worst,
but so are really drunk ones.
The sweet spot is one xanie,
four white wines.
If you're not first in line,
you're smelling somebody else's brown eye.
Living my life is like
playing Call oi Duty on easy.
I just go around and fuck shit up.
Why don't we take
"yes" for an answer.
Let me tell you about you.
You worked long and hard
to get to this moment.
Mountain air.
Freedom.
What are you gonna do?
Crawl back down because
you don't like the altitude?
You have an incomparable opportunity.
I told you about you.
Now let me tell you about me.
I wanna make you rich.
Is there anyone you wanna sit
in a room with?
Is there anyone you wanna know?
You wanna climb your stairs, or theirs?
Don't get your head
too far up your own ass.
Once people envied
and respected me.
They called me in.
Give me your ID's.
Give me your...
give me your pass to open the doors.
They have a checklist.
They didn't count the pros
and cons...
I gave my life up for you kids.
It wasn't a noble sacrifice.
It was what we were supposed to do.
It was the way I was raised.
Try starving once! I've tried it.
I've done it!
Now ifs all over. Now it's leaving me.
Now it's going away from me.
You think when you reach a
certain age things will start making sense.
Then you find out you're
just as last as you were before.
The pieces of your life
never to some together.
His goods are in peace. Bu! when
a stranger than he shall came upon you...
nice and
clear as a mountain stream.
In my vision
I was on the verandah of a vast estate,
There seemed to emanate from it a light
from within this gleaming, radiant marble.
That's good, that's good.
Tuck.
Relax your mouth.
Who is responsible for this clothing?
Who is it?
-  Can you step out of the wind?
-  Stop smiling.
And don't move too fast.
They didn't take eighty.
Doesn't matter.
Don't stare at me like this.
Lean into her.
Put your breasts against her back.
Don't look sweet. Don't look scared.
You like this, Helen.
Look into the camera. Fucking make
ii hard. You're a dirty, fucking bitch.
Work those muscles. You're a 1975 housewife
who takes steroids and fucks girls.
Stop, take your hands off your hip.
Hit her hard, pop.
I keep thinking
I can make a new start.
Helen?
Two weeks.
Can you swim?
Higher.
Is this a friendship we have?
I don't wanna wreak havoc
in men's lives anymore.
There's somewhere else
we needle get to.
How tenderly you touched my face...
except I got better
math and science scores...
Thank you.
-  How long will you be here?
-  A week, Sara's got folks here.
Have you been out here before?
You told me
that sometimes you felt like a spy.
You would hide behind
the rocking chair before he came home
You're always wondering, are they too cold,
are they warm enough?
-  Don't fucking move.
- Check him for his wallet.
Come on.
Got 20, 40, 60.
Couple hundred.
Take the TV?
You can't tow that down the street.
How come you ain't got nothin'
in this house, man!
- Keep looking.
- What kind of jacket is that? Take it off.
Take it off. Whoa, careful.
Yeah.
You've been there, down under?
What's your name?
What's your name?
Whatever you want it to be.
You pick.
You have a darkness on you.
A little shadow.
You live in a little fantasy world,
don't you?
Don't you?
Yes. Because ifs so much more fun.
Uh-huh. Changes every day.
I can be whatever I want to be.
Don't forget that.
You can be whoever you want to be.
You can be an asshole.
You can be a saint,
you can be a you can be a god.
I'll tell you,
but don't tell anyone, ifs a secret.
You liked that, didn't you?
Free.
Love danger.
Like living on the edge like this.
It's crazy, ifs scary.
What if I get busted?
Look at you with your little
eyes looking at me.
Sometimes I think I know so much more
about the world than other people.
You see, I took drugs once, and it kind of
opened up this window for me.
I call it the Window of Truth.
I saw the world in a different way...
I see things other people do not...
I think you had that experience, too.
Get out of the big cloud of dust
everybody's kicking up.
who laid the foundations of the earth,
The waters stood above the mountains.
A! thy rebuke they fled,
at the voice of thy thunder
they hasted away.
They go down by the valleys unto the place
which thou has! founded for them.
and herb for the service of man that he may
bring forth food out of the earth...
Very loving and enchanting.
Most affectionate.
Real nice to get along.
Very beautiful.
I like your outfit, too, especially the
boots. Now they're a touch of class.
Are you a religious man?
- You have a cross around your neck.
-  Absolutely.
Oh, even though I'm in darkness,
I believe in the light.
I was instructed from some information
to be no part of the world
nor of the things in it.
But my eyes are now simple,
and I'm carnal when I see beautiful women
and big cars and lots of money,
and I wanna be a part of it.
I mean, who needs a bed
this big? Pretty good, huh?
Look at you,
hanging out there with your girls and your
money. Are you feeling happy?
- Yes.
- It makes you happy?
-  It depends who owns the money.
- It's my new fur. He bought it for me.
This man is in love with me.
Just some other girl.
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.
I thought you were dead.
- I can't believe I actually met Elvis.
- You never know in this town.
That's my move.
Do you think I'll be as famous as Elvis?
he hath turned the shadow
of death into the morning,
Go,
I don't feel guilty
that I've fallen in love with you.
You're afraid
you're making me break my vows.
But the vow comes out
of the love behind it.
I remember when
I came down out of the mountains
and I was conditioned with
being absolutely clear.
if not enlightened,
at least wiser than I had been.
You have to kneel in a certain way and
you have to bow at the appropriate time.
And it's all beautifully timed,
even the sound of when they announce...
We walked 250 miles over the mountains,
into Tibet area.
And every... couple days,
every 20 miles or so,
you knew you were
going back in history, in time...
But don't forget
their life is so circumscribed.
If you're living in a cave eating nettles,
it's not so difficult to keep life simple.
You don't have honking horns and your wife
running in saying "You screwed up!"
The distractions are very few, and that's
the great attraction of the monk's life.
Teaching now... I only teach one thing.
You're so
Thumb, first finger, third
finger, left, fourth finger, third finger,
second finger, thumb, right hand, thumb,
first finger, second finger, thumb...
Open your mouth.
Don't lose it all
just because you've lost a part.
acknowledge that it was...
I wake up and...
I forget about it
for a few minutes and then...
and then I remember.
She's like "I had four of them.
You have to get over it and stop crying."
son,
Even now,
He's taking your hand and guiding you
If you are unhappy, you shouldn't
take it as a mark of God's disfavor.
Just the contrary.
Might be the very sign He loves you.
He shows His love
not by helping you avoid suffering,
by sending you suffering,
To suffer binds you to something
higher than yourself,
higher than your own will.
Takes you from the world
to find what lies beyond it.
We are not only to endure
patiently the troubles He sends,
Find the light
you know in {he east.
Wake up.
son,
