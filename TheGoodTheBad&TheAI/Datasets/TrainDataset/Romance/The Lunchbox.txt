It's raining today.
Don't play in the playground.
It will be very muddy.
If you slip, you'll
break your head.
- Play inside.
- Okay.
And don't walk under trees.
One fell nearby yesterday.
And an overpass collapsed,
we saw it on the news.
But it has stopped raining.
It can always start again.
Here he is.
Hey!
Wait a minute!
AUNTIE:
Did you remember all the spices?
No, Auntie, I think
I forgot something.
I knew it! I could
smell it up here!
Here.
Thank you, Auntie.
AUNTIE: Just a little bit does it.
Okay.
This new recipe will
do the trick for you.
Auntie.
I know you're laughing.
Don't believe me now.
But one day you'll see.
Mm.
Smells perfect!
One bite of that and he'll
build you a Taj Mahal.
The Taj Mahal is a tomb, Auntie.
I know that!
Take it back.
Fernandes.
Fernandes, this is Shaikh.
Shaikh, Mr. Fernandes.
Shaikh used to work in Saudi
Arabia as a chief accountant.
He will take over your responsibilities
when you leave next month.
Shaikh comes with
very good references.
Very pleased to meet you, sir.
Mr. Shroff
speaks very highly of you.
SHROFF: I had him join us early so that you
can train him in all that you do in Claims.
Good luck.
Mr. Shroff said you've
been here for 35 years.
Your colleagues will
miss you a lot.
How does it feel, sir?
I mean, your golden years are
about to start. How does it feel?
-  Oh, fantastic.
-  Fantastic.
Can we start the training?
Sure.
But it's lunchtime right now.
You come at 4:45.
Four forty-five, 4:45.
Okay, sir, no
problem. I'll come later then.
Thank you very
much, sir. Nice to meet you.
MAN :
In today's class the recipe is
the all-time favorite
Paneer Do Pyaza.
Auntie.
Auntie.
- Are you asleep?
- AUNTIE: What happened?
Auntie, the lunchbox is back.
So? Go on.
It's completely empty.
Completely?
Yes!
It's like he's licked it clean!
What did I tell you?
This is just the beginning.
Oh.
Auntie, turn the tape
off. Rajeev is back.
AUNTIE: Okay.
Good, you came back early.
How was lunch today?
It was good.
Um...
Just good?
Good, as usual.
You sent the lunchbox back empty
so I thought...
Your cauliflower was really good.
It was very good.
Hello. Ah.
Just reached home.
I was waiting for your update.
Okay.
Oh. Oh-ho. Was it so boring?
What can you do?
Auntie?
Auntie.
What happened now, sir?
I'm retiring next month.
I'll be canceling the
lunchbox service.
Okay, sir. I'll make a note of it.
I'll settle up at the
end of the month.
Okay, sir. No problem.
Fine.
And...
Who made the lunch today?
We did, sir. Why?
The food was good!
- What?
- It was good, very good.
Maintain the same standard. Okay?
What's with him today?
The cauliflower did it for us!
Let's make it again tomorrow.
Here, serve this.
FERNANDES : Hey, hey.
What is this?
GIRL : Mr. Fernandes,
a ball went inside your balcony.
Please, can we have it?
BOY : Please, sir?
- Do I look like your servant?
- CHILDREN: No.
Please. We'll not play here.
We'll play on another side.
If you play in front of this door again,
I'll chase you down in the street.
- Please. Please.
- BOY: Sir, we'll play on the other side.
GIRL: Mr. Fernandes, please. Sorry.
Huh?
AUNTIE: Ila!
Oh, Ila.
Ila.
Yes, Auntie, I'm here.
- Did you call out to me earlier?
- Yes.
I was changing Uncle's diaper.
What did Rajeev say?
Nothing.
What?
Auntie, the lunchbox
went to someone else.
I don't think Rajeev got it.
It went to someone else who
liked it and finished it.
But the delivery men
never make a mistake.
What is it?
Good morning, sir. How are you?
Good morning.
Sir, I came by yesterday.
You were not to be seen.
I was right here. You were late.
I was here at 4.45.
I was here. You were late.
No problem, sir.
Are these Claims files, sir?
This is the Claims Department.
Uh... Uh...
When do we start the training, sir?
Let's do it.
Definitely, sir?
Let's do it after lunch.
- I'll come back then.
- Yes, come back.
- Are you sure, sir?
- Yes.
You'll definitely be here?
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
ILA: Thank you for sending
back an empty lunchbox.
I had made that food
for my husband.
And when it came back empty, I thought
he would say something to me.
For a few hours, I thought the way to
the heart is really through the stomach.
Auntie, this letter
business is strange.
Ila, you owe a thank you.
What happens if this
goes to Rajeev?
So good.
Rajeev ate someone else's food
yesterday and didn't notice.
Let him notice today.
Should I write something else?
No. Keep it short!
Auntie!
Auntie.
Are you asleep?
AUNTIE: What happened?
Auntie.
The lunchbox has come back.
It's empty again, but with a reply.
- A reply?
- Yes.
What does it say?
And it's not in
Rajeev's handwriting.
Read it!
Uh... "Dear, Ila,
the food was very salty today."
What else does it say?
"Dear, Ila, the food
was very salty today."
What? No "Thank you," no "Hello"?
"Dear Ila, the food was
very salty today."
Who does he think he is?
He empties the lunchbox
and then complains!
Wait a minute.
Here, use this.
No, I don't like all this.
I'll tell the delivery man the box
is going to the wrong address.
AUNTIE: He should've thanked you!
No, I really don't like this.
Why? It's not like you know him.
Good afternoon, sir. How are you?
Good.
I couldn't find you at
your desk, so I came here.
You were reading in the canteen,
so I didn't want to disturb.
Your lunchbox has an amazing aroma.
I could taste the food
without eating it!
Your wife, sir,
she has magic in her hands.
My wife is dead.
FERNANDES :
Dear Ila, the salt was fine today.
The chili was a bit
on the higher side.
They helped to extinguish
the fire in my mouth.
And I think it'll also
be good for the motions.
There are so many people in this city
who eat only a banana or two for lunch.
My husband
came home late last night.
This morning he went to work.
My daughter went to school.
And I started cooking
with Deshpande Auntie.
Her husband has been in a
coma for the last 15 years.
One day he woke up and started
staring at the ceiling fan.
In the morning he wakes up
and stares at the fan again.
This has been going
on for 15 years.
Even the doctors
have lost hope now.
Auntie thinks that the
fan keeps him alive.
And so did the fan.
Uncle's heartbeat slowed.
After that, Deshpande Auntie
had a generator installed.
What do we live for?
Madam.
FERNANDES: Dear Ila, your
husband sounds like a busy man.
There are too many people, and
everyone wants what the other has.
Years ago, you could find a place to
sit in the train every now and then,
he will see the difference and probably
go back to his Orient ceiling fan.
When my wife died, she got
a horizontal burial plot.
I tried to buy a burial plot
for myself the other day,
and what they offered
me was a vertical one.
I've spent my whole life
standing in trains and buses,
now I'll have to stand
even when I'm dead.
Sometimes having a child
can help a marriage.
It's nice.
You forgot.
The last time I wore this
was for our honeymoon.
I thought I'd try it today and
see if it needed altering.
But look. It fits perfectly.
- Doesn't it?
- Yes.
In fact, it's loose.
Yes, it looks good.
After our honeymoon, we had no
idea that Yashvi was on the way.
We didn't find out for a while.
We didn't find out for two months!
We didn't have much then.
Mm.
When she arrived, our luck turned.
These days things are so
expensive, luck is not enough.
And why do you make
cauliflower every day?
Did you buy it in bulk?
Rajeev.
Mm-hm?
What if Yashvi had a
little brother or sister?
You had a brother.
And he...
Please don't make cauliflower
every day, it gives me gas.
Hm?
MAN: Rickshaw, bus, airplane...
Everything gets stuck
in Mumbai traffic.
This road has been
jammed for hours.
You see that building?
That tall tower.
A woman jumped off along with
her little girl this morning.
Jumped with her little girl?
Yes, she jumped.
What was her name?
How would I know, sir?
I'm not related to her.
Must be family problems.
Do you know someone
in that building?
Is she completely dead?
This morning,
my husband went to work...
Good afternoon, sir. How are you?
I'm busy, actually.
What about the training?
This is lunch time.
Please come back later.
Everybody told me not to
expect anything from you.
My name is Aslam Shaikh.
I am an orphan.
I gave myself this name.
I've taught myself
everything I know.
And I will teach myself
this job too. That's all.
Thank you very much.
Listen.
Come here.
You go to my desk.
There are files
from the Ahmedabad sector.
Calculate the amounts, prepare the pay
orders, and send them to Accounts.
Thank you very much, sir.
Okay.
Thank you so much, sir.
Sir, I'll be right back.
No, don't come back. You go work.
Yes, sir.
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Okay.
ILA: This morning, my husband went
to work and Yashvi to school.
I switched on the
radio, the news was on.
When my brother died,
everyone said the same thing:
What went through
that woman's mind?
Perhaps she took off
all her jewelry.
What did her daughter
ask on the way?
Mom, what are we going to play?
ILA: It must have been so
difficult to get to the roof.
Doesn't it take courage to
jump from tall buildings?
FERNANDES: Dear Ila, please
don't think like that.
Things are never as
bad as they seem.
One day I was on the
train on my way to work.
AUNTIE: Are you laughing?
Yes, Auntie.
I just remembered a joke.
Tell me the joke!
I forgot.
- You forgot?
- Yes.
Soak five almonds in
water every night
and eat them in the morning.
It's a tonic for memory.
I will right away, Auntie.
How are you, sir?
Going to the station?
Yes.
I get off at Bombay Central.
I live in Dongri.
- And you, sir?
- I live in Bandra.
Sir, can I ask you a question?
Yes.
People in the office say...
You were walking and kicked a cat.
It got hit by a bus,
and you just went on your
way. Didn't even look back.
Is this true, sir?
Actually, it wasn't a cat.
It was a blind man.
He asked for directions so I pushed
him, and he got hit by a bus.
You better be careful.
Thank you.
Give me a cigarette.
- I'll pay you later.
- Okay.
SHAIKH: You're joking, right?
Have you always lived in Bandra?
Yes, always.
I keep moving around.
First I was at Muhammad Ali Road,
then I went to Dubai,
then to Saudi Arabia.
I used to keep going back
and forth from Saudi,
but once I met Meherunissa
I never went back.
I cut the vegetables here,
so when I get home I can
just throw them in the pan.
Where did you learn to cut
vegetables like that?
I worked in a hotel in Saudi.
- A hotel?
- Yes.
Cooking, room service,
cleaning, accounts.
All in one.
It's dry in Saudi.
There's no such thing
as entertainment there.
You pray, you work,
you pray, you work.
And nothing else. Here
I get some free time.
Now I cook and wait
for Meherunissa.
She comes back in the evening.
We eat, then go for a walk.
Very good.
But I love her, sir.
No matter what.
What do you do in the evenings?
I watch TV...
sometimes...
Sir, come with me.
- Where?
- My house.
I'll make pasandas for you.
- What?
- Pasanda.
- What is that?
- It's a special lamb dish
that you chop like this.
- A lamb dish?
- Yes, sir.
And I'm a specialist.
Yes, I'll come.
- Come now.
- Today?
Please come now!
I have some important work at home
but I'll come next time.
- For sure next time?
- Yes.
Promise?
I'll be expecting you.
I'll come next time.
-  Okay, sir. See you, bye.
-  Bye-bye.
My husband came
home late last night.
He got a call and
went back to work.
When I got married, I took some
things without telling my mother.
Among those things I
found an old diary.
Grandma wrote all her recipes in it.
I found one for spring apples.
Excellent.
How are you, sir?
Can I sit?
Sit.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Here.
Try.
Sure?
Yeah.
What happened?
-  Who made this?
- Why?
A restaurant near my house.
Why?
It's great.
Just great. Sir, book a
lunchbox for me as well.
It's shutting down soon.
But it has such great food!
There's no value
for talent in this country.
You're right, sir, talent has
no value in this country.
You need magic in the hands.
Anyone can make food
but you need magic.
FERNANDES: Dear Ila, your
grandmother's recipe was very good.
Even better than my
favorite aubergines.
Yesterday even I found
something from many years ago.
I found old TV shows that
my wife used to record.
You must have been a child when they
played on TV, or not even born yet.
I don't know why I
wanted to see them.
I went through them show by
show, episode by episode.
And then finally, after
staying up all night,
I realized what it was
that I was looking for.
Every Sunday when she
watched the shows,
I was outside repairing my
bicycle or just smoking.
Andi would glance through the window
every now and then just for a second,
and I would see her
reflection on the TV screen.
Laughing at the same
jokes over and over.
Each time as if she was hearing
it for the very first time.
I wish I had kept on
looking back then.
I sent all the pay orders, sir.
An apple and a banana for you.
Okay. Have.
No, sir.
No, have.
Have.
Okay, sir.
- What is this?
-  Sir, uh, paper.
Could I have some water please?
- How is it? Good?
- Mm. I love this.
Yeah. Thank you.
Nowadays everyone
uses e-mail, not paper.
- What paper?
-  The letter.
We are in the era of e-mail.
My mother loves the old TV shows.
When I was little I would watch
them with her for hours.
Every cigarette takes five
minutes off your life.
AUNTIE: Oh, Ila.
Yes, Auntie.
Did you get my carrots?
Yes, here they are.
Here!
They only cost 10 rupees.
What else did you get?
ILA: The usual things, Auntie.
MAN : What's the
other name for "aubergine"?
It's vegetarian, so how come
it has "egg" in its name?
MOTHER:
He's on new medicine these days.
It helps,
but he sleeps all day.
Ma, where is the TV?
There are no good programs
on TV these days.
Do you need some money?
We're doing okay, child.
This new medicine
seems very expensive.
Don't worry. I'll handle it.
How?
Where will you get the money?
If my son were alive, I wouldn't
have to ask anyone for money.
- I'll talk to Rajeev.
- No, no! There is no need.
I'll arrange for
about 5,000 for now.
We're the girl's side.
Does it look nice? Asking
for money all the time?
It's fine, you can
pay it back slowly.
No.
I have some money.
I can handle it.
Okay, fine.
But don't tell your father.
The 5,000 should cover
the cost of the medicine
for this month.
Next month something will turn up.
Do you want to see him?
Shall I wake him?
It's late, we should go home.
MOTHER: Okay.
FERNANDES: Dear Ila, you won't believe
what happened to me yesterday.
In the evening, as I was walking
to the station with Shaikh...
...I felt like stopping to
look at a painter's works.
All his paintings are
exactly the same.
But when you look
close, real close,
you can see that they are different.
Each slightly different from the other.
A different car here, a different
man daydreaming on the bus there.
A stray dog gallantly
crossing the street.
Whatever catches the
painter's fancy on that day.
And then I treated myself
to an auto rickshaw.
The old houses of boys I used to play
with when I was a child are gone now.
And the hospital where I was born and
where my parents died. And my wife.
I think we forget things if we
have no one to tell them to.
Did you say something, sir?
What?
Did you say something?
No.
What are you playing?
Blind Man's Bluff.
Can I tell you what
we used to play?
What?
Look.
Let's untie this first.
Should I do it?
I'll do it.
We used to play house.
- Ah-uh.
- Mm.
This was the baby.
I was the father.
And your uncle used
to play the mother,
my wife.
I want to tell you something.
I thought I should confront him,
but I don't have the courage.
My daughter learned in school
that in Bhutan everyone is happy.
They don't have Gross Domestic Product,
only Gross National Happiness.
Madam.
You look very
distracted today, sir.
- Did I do anything wrong?
- No.
Tell me something, Shaikh.
Yes, sir.
Have you ever been to Bhutan?
Bhutan?
I was thinking instead of Nasik,
I could settle in Bhutan.
I've only been to Saudi.
Bhutan is good as well.
The economy is down there,
one rupee here is five there.
So one can go there.
My mother always used to say...
Always says:
"Sometimes the wrong train will
get you to the right station."
Your mother says?
But you told me you were an orphan.
I am, sir,
but when I say "my mother always
says" people take it more seriously.
And it feels good.
Right.
MAN : You are
listening to Radio Bhutan...
ILA:
How can we go to Bhutan together?
How are you, sir?
A banana and apple.
Here, try this.
Here, taste this.
You are glowing today, sir.
What is it?
You look 10 years younger.
Your mother says:
"The wrong train will get
you to the right station."
Mother is always right, sir.
-  How is it?
-  I love this.
- Variety.
- Variety, sir.
Auntie.
Auntie.
AUNTIE: Yes, what?
Auntie...
Do you have a tape of
that movie ?
Yes, why?
The songs were good, right?
They're okay.
Could we listen to it?
Now?
Yes.
Can you play it?
I'll play it.
Yesterday, Auntie played this tape
of the movie Saajan.
A strange coincidence.
She has every Hindi
movie audio tape,
she doesn't have a
CD or Mp3 player.
She keeps the cassette
industry alive all by herself.
Isn't it odd to keep
writing like this?
We can write anything in a
letter, it's very easy.
I've heard they have
very good kheema pao.
What?
MAN: The boss wants to see you.
Yes, I'll come after lunch.
It's urgent.
Okay, I'll come.
FERNANDES :
May I come in, sir?
Come in.
I just had a meeting with
the Accounts Department.
And it was the most embarrassing
meeting of my life.
You know what they said?
They said, "it's as if our Claims
Department does not exist."
All the pay orders are wrong.
Shaikh's initials are
all over the place.
And to think that I was going
to have this man replace you.
I need you to review this.
Stay up all night if
necessary, but fix it.
And as for you, Shaikh, just
get out of my sight. Please.
It's my mistake, sir.
I made the pay orders.
I asked his initials
because we work together.
It's my mistake.
Fernandes,
- you don't have to defend him.
- I'm not defending anyone, sir.
Thirty-five years of service.
And you have not made
one single mistake.
You know I would not
defend anyone, sir.
Anyway,
I'll handle the
Accounts Department.
- Okay?
- It's okay, sir, no problem.
One more thing. Why do these
files all smell of vegetables?
- Onions, potatoes, even garlic.
- Really?
Smell it. Smell it.
I don't...
Sorry, sir, you saved me today.
Thank you, sir, you saved me.
Don't you ever cut your bloody
vegetables on the office files.
Sorry, sir.
Next time,
I'll put a plastic bag over the files.
And then cut the vegetables.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry, sir,
no vegetables. Nothing.
I'm sorry, sir.
This isn't some
cheap restaurant in Saudi!
These are government files!
Do you understand?
If you cannot do this, get lost!
Why should I get lost?
You will teach me.
I am sorry, sir, but
you will teach me!
Did your mother also tell you
to forge a degree to get a job?
She must have gotten confused.
What kind of a
person you are, Mr. Shaikh?
Huh?
Why don't you come
over for dinner, sir?
Sir, please.
I've made pasandas.
Sir, please.
Unbelievable, Mr. Shaikh.
Unbelievable.
Pasanda, he says.
You'll come, right?
- SHAIKH: Sir, have more pasandas.
-  No, no, no. Uh...
It's very good.
It's my recipe, sir.
MEHERUNISSA: My father warned me:
"Don't marry him, he'll
chain you to the stove."
Her father is a very dangerous man.
Last time he smiled
was during the 1984 World Cup.
Just a little bit.
He's a sour face.
Sir, what does your wife do?
Be quiet.
I'm sorry, sir, she doesn't know.
It's okay.
My wife has passed away.
But I have a girlfriend.
You?
Yes.
MEHERUNISSA: What is her name?
Ila.
I knew it, sir!
The lunchbox, the notes...
When did you get married?
SHAIKH: Marriage, sir...
Sometimes it feels like 35 years.
Sometimes 25, or 10, and sometimes
it feels like it was yesterday.
Sir, you're not eating,
have some more.
It's my recipe, sir.
I really don't want it.
You're not eating at all.
Sir, I wanted to ask you something.
Go ahead.
You asked just now
when we got married.
Actually,
her father said no.
He said: "The boy is an orphan,
short and dark-skinned."
So Meherunissa ran away from home.
But she doesn't want to get married
without her father's blessing.
I won't tell anyone.
No. It's not that.
Her father has agreed now.
We are getting married soon.
There'll be an army from
her side at the wedding.
Brothers and sisters,
their husbands, children,
uncles, aunts, everyone
will be there.
And there is no one from my side.
I'm alone.
I wanted to ask, if
you wouldn't mind,
being the witness from my side.
My "guardian."
Me?
Yes, and if Madam
Ila can come too...
Of course.
-  Thank you very much.
- Welcome.
Thank you so much, sir.
Her father insists
on giving me a scooter.
As a gift for my promotion.
But I'm not retiring.
I was thinking
of not taking early retirement.
Uh...
I'll ask the boss to
make you my assistant.
So your promotion...
That's good news, sir!
I mean, great news!
Don't mention it to my father-in-law,
he'll take the scooter back.
- Ha, ha.
-  Sir, please.
I'll tell
Meherunissa the good news.
Thank you very much, sir.
MAN: Uncle, would you like to sit?
Who, me?
Yes, Uncle, would you like to sit?
No.
Please, I'm getting off
at the next station.
SHROFF: Fernandes.
-  Yes, sir.
- You wanted to talk to me?
No, sir.
My secretary said you
wanted to talk to me.
It was about pay orders.
What about the pay orders?
I solved it.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- I'll see you soon.
- Yes, sir.
WAITER: Would you like to order?
MAN :
Let's move to architecture now.
New services keep on coming out
and keep on getting close.
Let's see if any one of them can
perhaps be a little easier to use.
FERNANDES: Dear Ila, I got the lunchbox
today. There was nothing in it.
Yesterday you waited in the
restaurant for me for a long time.
But before that, that same morning
I forgot something in the bathroom.
Exactly the same as it used to be after
my grandfather had been in the shower.
It was like my grandfather
had been there.
Just me and the smell
of an old man.
Maybe it was that morning. Maybe
it was many, many mornings ago.
And maybe if I'd forgotten
something in the bathroom before,
MAN: Uncle, would you like a seat?
No, no.
Life kept on going and
lulled me with its motions.
I kept rocking back and forth as it
threw me left and threw me right.
No one buys yesterday's
lottery ticket, Ila.
I came to the restaurant
while you were waiting.
I wanted to come up to you and
tell you all this in person,
And for some time, you
let me into your dreams.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
The two ladies at the back,
please come in front.
I can't see you.
Smile, please.
One, two, three.
Now a photo with everyone!
The girl's side to the right.
The boy's side to the left please.
The boy's side to the left please.
Smile, please.
You're leaving, sir?
This is the new scooter?
Want a lift?
If you stay and don't retire,
- I'll return it to Meherunissa's father.
- Ha, ha.
Taxi!
The weather is strange.
It's like there's a drought.
Okay.
Goodbye, Shaikh.
Do you know, sir,
the first time I took the train
with you, in first class,
I hadn't bought a ticket.
I spent the whole journey
till Bombay Central
praying I wouldn't be caught.
What would you have
thought of me? Ha, ha.
But the very next day, I got
a first class pass made.
You'll be a good husband, Shaikh.
Thank you very much, sir.
Wait.
Come to Nasik sometime.
ILA : Hello.
Ma...
I'm coming.
Eighty rupees.
Rajeev is on his way.
He's in a meeting.
He'll go straight
to the crematorium.
I'm very hungry.
I'm craving parathas.
I didn't eat breakfast
this morning.
I was making breakfast for him.
Okay, Ma.
I was always worried...
about what would happen to
me when he passed away.
- Never mind.
- But now...
I just feel hungry.
Ma.
In the beginning,
there was a lot of
love between us...
when you were born.
But for several years,
I've been disgusted by him.
Ma.
- Every morning, his breakfast,
- Ma.
His medicine, his bath...
Breakfast, medicine, bath...
When your brother died...
that old ambulance
with a red light came.
Remember? Huh?
Those old Matador models.
Which one has come now?
Huh?
What color?
White.
With the blue light.
Okay.
Mister.
Yes.
This lunchbox is going
to the wrong address.
How can it go to the wrong address?
We don't deliver it wrong.
Yes, I understand.
But my lunchbox has not been
going to the right address.
- It goes to the right address.
- It doesn't.
People from Harvard came...
Forget about them.
Listen to me. Try to
understand what I'm saying.
This lunchbox that I give to
you does not go to my husband.
Instead it goes to someone
else, who has been eating it.
The Harvard people came here
and studied our system.
- They said we don't deliver wrong...
- It's been going to the wrong address.
Do you think I am a liar?
The King of England came in
person to see our system.
But this lunchbox
is going somewhere.
It goes to the right building.
I want the address
of that building!
Saajan Fernandes' desk?
He sits two desks down.
Is this Saajan Fernandes' desk?
Let me call you back.
Saajan Fernandes?
He left.
I mean he left the job.
Where can I find him?
Nasik.
He left for Nasik.
So you are going to Nasik?
Yes.
Are you moving there?
Yes.
Permanently?
Yes.
I retired three years ago.
I come back to see my
son every now and then.
Sorry, Ila, ma'am.
Throw.
BOY : Come on, Calvin.
Good evening, Mr. Fernandes.
GIRL :
We thought that you're gone.
I was gone.
- But I came back.
- Why?
Okay, you play here, but
don't break anybody's glass.
Okay?
Take it.
CHILDREN :
Thank you, Mr. Fernandes.
- Come on, Calvin.
- CHILDREN: Come on, Calvin.
AUNTIE: Ila?
Ila?
Auntie.
I've been calling out
since this afternoon.
Where were you?
I had something to take care of.
I got worried.
I ran out of diapers
for your uncle.
But I asked the super to get them.
Do you know, Ila?
I cleaned your uncle's fan today.
Without turning it off!
This morning you probably
woke up and made some tea.
And after that maybe you
went for a morning walk.
My bracelets, earrings
and my wedding necklace.
So maybe we'll be
okay for some time.
By the time Yashvi comes home
from school, I'll have packed.
and your new postman
will deliver it.
Or maybe I should
keep it for myself.
that sometimes the wrong train
will get you to the right station.
