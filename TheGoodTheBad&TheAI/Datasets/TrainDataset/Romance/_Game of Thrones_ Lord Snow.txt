You'd be more
comfortable there.
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.
I'll stay with Drogo
until he fulfills
his end of the bargain
and I have my crown.
Jon:
I have something for you.
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.
with Robert Baratheon.
-
- Ned:
There's great honor serving
in The Night's Watch.
The Starks have manned The Wall for
thousands of years.
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.
What of it?
Tell me we're not speaking of this.
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.
Rapers. Not impressed
by your new brothers?
Welcome.
Catelyn:
I don't think Bran
fell from that tower.
I think he was thrown.
No!
- Lord Stark must be told of this.
- Catelyn:
What is the meaning
of this?
Cersei:
Arya:
-
- Ahh!
We found no trace
of the direwolf, Your Grace.
- We have another wolf.
- As you will.
He doesn't mean Lady,
does he?

Welcome, Lord Stark.
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.
The honor of your presence
is requested.
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my Lord.
If you'd like to change into
something more appropriate...
Thank the gods
you're here, Stark.
About time we had some
stern, northern leadership.
About glad to see you're
protecting the throne.
Sturdy old thing.
How many Kings' asses
have polished it, I wonder?
Um, what's the line?
The King shits
and The Hand wipes.
Very handsome armor.
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.
You've chosen your opponents
wisely then.
I have a knack for it.
It must be strange for you
coming into this room.
I was standing right here
when it happened.
He was very brave,
your brother.
Your father too.
They didn't deserve
to die like that.
Nobody deserves
to die like that.
But you just stood there
and watched.
and watched.
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms--
you think anyone said a word,
lifted a finger?
No, Lord Stark.
was silent as a crypt.
Except for the screams,
of course,
and the Mad King
laughing.
And later...
when I watched
the Mad King die,
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...
It felt like justice.
Is that what you
tell yourself at night?
You're a servant
of justice?
That you were avenging
my father when you
shoved your sword in
Aerys Targaryen's back?
Tell me--
if I'd stabbed the Mad King
in the belly instead of the back,
would you admire me more?
You served him well
when serving was safe.
Lord Stark.
Lord Varys.
I was grievously sorry to hear of
your troubles on the Kingsroad.
We are all praying for
Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
A shame you didn't say
a prayer for the butcher's son.
Renly!
You're looking well.
And you look
tired from the road.
I told them this meeting could
wait another day, but--
Man:
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.
No doubt Lady Catelyn
has mentioned me.
She has, Lord Baelish.
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem
from navel to collarbone.
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.
It wasn't the
that I chose, my Lord.
It was Catelyn Tully.
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.
I humbly beg your pardon,
my Lord Stark.
Grand Maester.
How many years has it been?
-
- And you served another King.
Oh, how forgetful of me.
This belongs to you, now.
- Without the King?
- Winter may be coming,
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.
Varys:
His Grace has many cares.
He entrusts some
small matters to us
that we might
lighten the load.
We are the Lords
of Small Matters here.
in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.
Mmm, how much?
to the champion,
the winning archer.
Can the treasury bear
such expense?
I'll have to borrow it.
The Lannisters will
accommodate, I expect.
We already owe Lord Tywin
three million gold.
What's another 80,000?
Are you telling me the crown
is three million in debt?
I'm telling you the crown
is  million in debt.
How could you
let this happen?
The Master of Coin
finds the money.
The King
and The Hand spend it.
I will not believe
Jon Arryn
allowed Robert
to bankrupt the realm.
Lord Arryn gave wise
and prudent advice,
but I fear his Grace
- doesn't always listen.
- "Counting coppers," he calls it.
I'll speak to him
tomorrow.
This tournament is an
extravagance we cannot afford.
As you will. But still,
we'd best make our plans.
There will be no plans
until I speak to Robert.
Forgive me, my Lords.
I'm--
-
- You are The King's Hand,
Lord Stark, we serve
at your pleasure.
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.
- It's ugly.
- A King should have scars
you fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.
I'm not like him.
I didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all
I did was scream.
And the two Stark girls
saw it, both of them.
That's not true.
You killed the beast.
You only spared the girl because
of the love your father bears her father.
I didn't, I--
When Aerys Targaryen
sat on the Iron Throne,
your father was a rebel
and a traitor.
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.
Do I have
to marry her?
Yes.
She's very beautiful
and young.
If you don't like her, you only
need to see her on formal occasions
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.
And if you'd rather lie
with noble virgins, so be it.
You are my darling boy
and the world will be
exactly as you
want it to be.
Do something nice
for the Stark girl.
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.
The occasional kindness will spare
you all sorts of trouble down the road.
We allow the Northerners
too much power.
They consider themselves
our equals.
How would you handle them?
I'd double their taxes
and command them to supply
A Royal Army?
Why should every lord
command his own men?
It's primitive,
no better than the hill tribes.
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the crown,
trained by
experienced soldiers--
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.
And if
the Northerners rebel?
I'd crush them.
Seize Winterfell and install
someone loyal to the realm
as warden of the North.
Uncle Kevan, maybe.
And these 10,000 Northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?
- For me. I'm their King.
-
But you've just
invaded their homeland,
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.
The North cannot be held--
not by an outsider.
It's too big and too wild.
And when the winter comes,
the Seven Gods together couldn't
save you and your royal army.
A good King knows
when to save his strength...
And when to destroy
his enemies.
So you agree...
The Starks are enemies?
Everyone who isn't us
is an enemy.
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?
- The Prince.
-
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.
The Hound killed your friend.
The Hound does whatever
the Prince tells him to do.
You're an idiot.
You're a liar, and if
you told the truth
- Mycah would be alive.
- Enough!
What's happening here?
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.
Go to your room.
We'll speak later.
That's for you, love.
Don't you like it?
I haven't played with dolls
since I was eight.
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.
It's all right.
Go on.
War was easier
than daughters.
-
- Go away!
Ned:
May I come in?
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.
Give it to me.
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.
Where did you get this?
This is no toy.
Little ladies shouldn't
play with swords.
I wasn't playing.
And I don't want
to be a lady.
Come here.
Now what do you want
with this?
It's called Needle.
Oh, a blade with a name.
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?
Your sister?
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?
Stick 'em
with the pointy end.
That's the essence of it.
I was trying
to learn.
I asked Mycah
to practice with me.
I asked him.
- It was my fault.
- No, sweet girl.
No no, you didn't kill
the butcher's boy.
I hate them!
I hate all of them.
The Hound, the Queen
and the King
and Joffrey and Sansa.
Sansa was dragged before
the King and Queen...
And asked to call
the Prince a liar.
So was I!
He  a liar.
Shh, darling,
listen to me.
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey's someday.
She cannot betray him.
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?
Well.
Look me.
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.
Winter is coming.
You were born
in the long summer.
You've never known
anything else.
But now winter
is truly coming.
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,
look after one another.
Sansa is your sister.
I don't hate her.
Not really.
I don't want
to frighten you,
but I won't lie
to you either.
We've come
to a dangerous place.
We cannot fight a war
amongst ourselves.
All right?
Go on.
It's yours.
I can keep it?
Try not to stab
your sister with it.
If you're going
to own a sword,
you'd better
know how to use it.
Don't listen to it.
Crows are all liars.
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.
I know a story about a boy
who hated stories.
I could tell you about
Ser Duncan the tall.
Those were always
your favorites.
Those weren't
my favorites.
My favorites were
the scary ones.
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?
Fear is for the winter,
when the snows fall
a hundred feet deep.
Fear is for the long night,
when the Sun
hides for years
and children are born
and live and die
all in darkness.
That is the time for fear,
my little lord,
when the White Walkers
move through the woods.
Thousands of years ago
there came a night
that lasted a generation.
Kings froze to death
in their castles,
same as the Shepherds
in their huts.
And women smothered
their babies
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.
So is this the sort
of story that you like?
In that darkness,
the White Walkers
came for the first time.
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as Hounds--
Only what what the little lord
telling wants to hear.
Get your supper.
I want some time with him.
-
- One time she told me
the sky is blue because
we live inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant
named Macomber.
Maybe we do.
How do you feel?
You still don't
remember anything?
Bran,
I've seen you climb
a thousand times.
In the wind, in the rain--
a thousand times.
- You never fall.
- I did though.
It's true, isn't it,
what Maester Luwin
says about my legs?
I'd rather be dead.
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.
Fewer eyes
back here, my Lady.
But still too many.
It's nine years since I've
set foot in the capital.
And no one knew who I was
the last time I came either.
My Lady.
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?
I would.
We've done nothing wrong.
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.
Instructed?
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but--
follow me, Lady Stark.
Cat!
Go on.
Go upstairs.
You little worm!
You take me for some
back-alley Sally
you can drag into a--
pssst!
I meant no disrespect
to you of all people.
How dare you
bring me here!
Have you
lost your mind?
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I'm truly sorry
about the locale.
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?
A dear friend told me.
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.
To see you again after so
many years is a blessing.
Your poor hands.
How did you know
I was coming?
Knowledge is
my trade, my Lady.
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?
My little birds
are everywhere...
Even in the North.
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.
Valyrian steel.
Do you know whose dagger
this is?
I must admit
I do not.
Well well, this is
an historic day.
Something you don't know
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.
- It's mine.
- Yours?
At least it was, until the tournament on
Prince Joffrey's last Nameday.
I bet on Ser Jaime
in the jousting,
as any sane man would.
When the Knight of the Flowers
unseated him,
I lost this dagger.
To whom?
Tyrion Lannister.
The imp.
Man:
If that were a real sword,
you'd be dead.
Lord Snow here
grew up in a castle
spitting down
on the likes of you.
Pyp.
Do you think
Ned Stark's bastard
bleeds
like the rest of us?
Next!
Well, Lord Snow,
Go clean yourselves up.
A charming man.
Commander:
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways
into men
of The Night's Watch.
And how's that going,
commander Mormont?
Slowly.
A raven came
for Ned Stark's son.
Good news or bad?
Both.
Maester Pycelle:
I meant to give you this earlier.
So forgetful
these days.
A raven from Winterfell
this morning.
Good news?
Perhaps you'd like to share it
with your wife?
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?
Woman:
I thought that she'd
be safest in here.
One of several such
establishments I own.
You're a funny man.
Huh?
A very funny man.
Ned!
Ah, the Starks--
quick tempers,
slow minds.
You broke
my nose, bastard!
It's an improvement.
If we threw you over The Wall,
I wonder how long it would take you to hit.
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.
What're you looking at,
half man?
I'm looking
at you.
Hmm, very
distinctive faces.
All of you.
And what do you care
about our faces?
It's just I think
they would look marvelous
decorating spikes
in King's Landing.
Perhaps I'll write my sister,
the Queen, about it.
We'll talk later,
Lord Snow.
Everybody knew
what this place was
and no one told me.
No one but you.
My father knew
and he left me to rot
at The Wall all the same.
Grenn's father
left him too...
Outside a farmhouse
when he was three.
His little sister hadn't
eaten in three days.
He was given a choice:
His right hand or The Wall.
I've been asking
the lord commander about them.
Fascinating stories.
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.
It's a lucky thing
none of them were trained
by a Master-at-Arms
like your Ser Rodrik.
I don't imagine any of them
have ever held a real sword
before they came here.
Oh...
Your brother Bran.
He's woken up.
The mere suggestion
that the queen's brother
tried to kill your boy
would be considered treason.
We have proof.
We have the blade.
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.
The only man who could say
otherwise has no throat,
thanks to your boy's
wolf.
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.
He's like a little brother
to me, Ned.
He would never
betray my trust.
I'll try to keep you
alive, for her sake.
A fool's task, admittedly,
I won't forget this.
You're a true friend.
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.
He's a child--
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing.
He's said nothing.
He remembers nothing.
Then what are you
raving about?
What if it
comes back to him?
If he tells his father
what he saw--
we'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.
We'll say
whatever we like.
I think we can outfox
a 10-year-old.
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.
They can write
a ballad about us:
"The War
for Cersei's Cunt."
- Let me go.
- Never.
- Let me go.
- The boy
won't talk.
And if he does,
I'll kill him.
Him, Ned Stark, the king-
the whole bloody lot of them,
until you and I are
the only people
left in this world.
I wish I could
see the girls.
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.
Until we know
who our enemies are--
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.
In my bones,
I know it.
Littlefinger's right.
I can't do anything
without proof.
And if you find the proof?
Then I bring it to Robert...
And hope he's still
the man I once knew.
You watch yourself
on the road, huh?
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.
My temper?
Gods be good,
you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.
He still loves you.
Does he?
Off with you.
Yes, it's been a long time.
But I still remember
every face.
You remember
your first?
Of course,
Your Grace.
Who was it?
A Tyroshi.
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.
How'd you do it?
Lance through
the heart.
Lucky for you.
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,
thinking he could end
the rebellion
Caved in his breastplate.
Probably shattered
every rib he had.
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "wait!
Wait."
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.
They don't put that part
in the songs.
Stupid boy.
He could have lingered
on the edge of the battle
with the smart boys
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,
and he'd be waking
three times in the night
to piss into a bowl.
Wine!
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.
Lancel Lannister.
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?
What are you doing?
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean it's empty?
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?
So get more.
Tell your cousin
to get in here.
Kingslayer!
Get in here.
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair
and their smug,
satisfied faces.
It must wound
your pride, huh?
Standing out there
like a glorified sentry.
Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...
Forced to mind the door
while your King
eats and drinks
and shits and fucks.
So come on.
We're telling war stories.
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?
One of the outlaws
in the Brotherhood.
I was there that day.
You were only a squire,
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.
Best move I ever saw.
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.
Any last words?
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmmm.
What about
Aerys Targaryen?
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?
I never asked.
Did he call you
a traitor?
Did he plead
for a reprieve?
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...
"Burn them all."
If that's all,
Your Grace...
Do the Dothraki buy
their slaves?
The Dothraki don't
believe in money.
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.
- From whom?
- If you rule a city
and you see the horde approaching,
you have two choices:
Pay tribute or fight.
An easy choice
for most.
Of course, sometimes
it's not enough.
Sometimes a Khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.
Sometimes a Khal decides his riders
haven't had a good fight in months
-
-
Tell them all to stop.
You want the entire
horde to stop?
For how long?
Until I command them
otherwise.
You're learning
to talk like a Queen.
Not a Queen.
A Khaleesi.
Jorah:
Annakhas dozgosores.
-
- You dare!
You give commands to me?
To
You do not command the Dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
I don't take orders
from savages
or their sluts.
Do you hear me?
Rakharo ask if you want
him dead, Khaleesi.
No.
-
- Rakharo say you should take ear,
- to teach respect.
- Please please, don't hurt him.
Tell him I don't want
my brother harmed.
Huh?
-
-
Mormont!
Kill these Dothraki dogs!
I am your King!
Shall we return
to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?
Uh uh uh uh uh.
You walk.
Benjen:
I wanted to be here when you
saw it for the first time.
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?
I'm the First Ranger.
My job is out there.
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?
The kind I don't
want to believe.
I'm ready.
I won't let you down.
You're not going.
You're no Ranger, Jon.
- But I'm better than every--
- Better than no one!
Here...
A man gets what he earns,
when he earns it.
We'll speak when I return.
- A bear's balls.
- Tyrion: Oh, you're joking?
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart
all fried in his own fat.
When you're a hundred miles
North of The Wall
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.
And how do
a bear's balls taste?
A bit chewy.
And what about you, my Lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
Do Dornish girls count?
So you roam
the Seven Kingdoms,
collaring pickpockets
and horse thieves
and bringing them here
as eager recruits?
Aye.
But it's not all of 'em's
done bad things.
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.
They have a better chance
finding feed than glory.
The Night's Watch is
a joke to you, is it?
Is that what we are,
Lannister?
An army of jesters
in black?
You don't have enough men
to be an army
and aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.
But something to think about
while you're drinking
your wine down there,
enjoying your brothels--
half the boys you've seen training
will die North of The Wall.
might just be the cold.
They die in pain.
And they do it so plump
little lords like you
can enjoy their summer afternoons
in peace and comfort.
Do you think
I'm plump?
Listen, Benjen--
may I call you Benjen?
I have great admiration
for The Night's Watch.
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.
You know, my brother
once told me
that nothing someone says
before the word "but"
really counts.
But...
I don't believe that Giants and Ghouls
and White Walkers
are lurking
beyond The Wall.
I believe that
the only difference
between us and
the Wildlings is that
when The Wall went up,
our ancestors happened
to live on
the right side of it.
You're right.
The Wildlings are
no different from us.
A little rougher maybe.
But they're made
of meat and bone.
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.
It's not the Wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.
You've never been
North of The Wall,
so don't tell me
what's out there.
Are you going below?
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.
Oh, I always do.
I think he's starting
to like me.
- "Going below"?
- Aye.
Into the tunnel
and out the other side.
He'll be North of The Wall
for a month or two.
So you're heading down
to King's Landing too.
Aye, day after tomorrow.
I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.
I... I travel a bit
on the grubby side, my Lord.
Not this time.
We'll be staying at
the finest castles and inns.
No one turns away
a Lannister.
At Jakar?
Ath ja haker.
Yes, Khaleesi.
Oh, what are you doing?
When was last time
you bleed, Khaleesi?
You change, Khaleesi.
Jorah:
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade
is a good thing,
easier to handle.
It's a good weapon
for a Dothrakan.
But a man in full plate--
the  won't get
through the steel.
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.
Designed for piercing plate.
- Armor.
- Armor.
Armor make a man...
-
- Slow.
- Slow.
- It's true,
but it also keeps
a man alive.
He still is.
A man of great honor
and I betrayed him.
I don't think
she wants to eat dog.
The Khaleesi
have baby inside her.
-
-
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.
I need to ride to Qohor.
Uh, we ride
for Vaes Dothrak.
Don't worry.
I'll catch you.
The horde's easy to find.
Don't stand so still.
It's harder to hit
a moving target.
Except for you.
You move too much.
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.
Maester Aemon:
Eight-- no, nine.
All of them brief?
They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.
This summer
has lasted nine.
But reports from the Citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.
The Starks are always
right eventually:
Winter is coming.
This one will be long
and dark things
will come with it.
We've been
capturing Wildlings,
more every month.
They're fleeing south.
Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport
say they see mermaids.
One of our own Rangers swore
he saw them kill his companions.
He swore it right up
to the moment
Ned Stark
chopped his head off.
standing between the realm
and what lies beyond.
of undisciplined boys
and tired old men.
There are less than
a thousand of us now.
We can't man the other
castles on The Wall.
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed
- and fed.
- Your sister
sits by the side the King.
Tell her we need help.
gods help us all
if we're not ready.
I'm sorry to see
you leave, Lannister.
It's either me
or this cold.
And  doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?
I expect I will.
Gods know there aren't
many feather beds
between here
and King's Landing.
If you see
my brother Bran,
tell him I miss him.
Tell him I'd visit
if I could.
Of course.
He'll never walk again.
If you're going to be
a cripple,
it's better to be
a rich cripple.
You take care, Snow.
Farewell, my Lord.
You are late, boy.
Who are you?
Your dancing master,
Tomorrow
you will catch it.
Now pick it up.
That is not
the way, boy.
This is not a greatsword that is
needing two hands to swing it.
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be
to make you strong.
Just so.
One hand is all
that is needed.
Now you are standing
all wrong.
Turn your body sideface.
Yes.
So.
You are skinny.
That is good.
The target is smaller.
Now the grip--
let me see.
Yes.
The grip must be
delicate.
What if I drop it?
The steel must be
part of your arm.
Can you drop
part of your arm? No.
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.
I'm a girl.
Boy, girl--
you are a sword,
that is all.
That is the grip.
You are not holding
a battle-axe.
- You are holding--
- A Needle.
Ahhh.
Just so.
Now we will begin the dance.
Remember, child,
this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning--
the Knight's Dance,
hacking and hammering.
This is the Bravo's Dance...
The Water Dance.
It is swift
and sudden.
All men are made of water,
do you know this?
If you pierce them,
the water leaks out
and they die.
Now you will try
to strike me.
Ha!
Up!
Ha!
Ah.
Dead.
Oh!
Dead.
Very dead.

- Syrio: Come.
Ah ah ah!

-
Again, faster.
Ah.
