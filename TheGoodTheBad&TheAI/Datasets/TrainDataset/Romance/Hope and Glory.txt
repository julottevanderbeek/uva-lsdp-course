IN THE DIM LIGHT--
PERHAPS THE DIM LIGHT
BETWEEN PEACE AND WAR--
THE KING RETURNS TO LONDON.
A FEW HOURS LATER, HIS MAJESTY
HOLDS A PRIVY COUNCIL,
WHILE THE TENSION
GROWS WORLDWIDE.
MR. CHAMBERLAIN RETURNS
FROM AN AUDIENCE WITH THE KING.
PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLES
TO WRITE A NEW PAGE IN HISTORY.
THERE HAS NEVER
BEEN A DOUBT
THAT EVERY BRITISH CITIZEN
WOULD PLAY HIS PART.
LONDON PREPARES
ITS DEFENSES
AGAINST ATTACK
FROM THE AIR.
EVERY CITIZEN MUST KNOW
WHAT TO DO
IN AN AIR RAID.
DO YOU KNOW
THE WARNING SIGNALS?
WE REPEAT THEM SOFTLY,
TO AVOID ALARMING ANYONE
OUTSIDE THIS THEATER.
ALL CLEAR!
ALL CLEAR!
HAVE YOU GOT
YOUR GAS MASK?
IT WAS ALL
THEY TALKED ABOUT--
GETTING READY FOR WAR.
BUT NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.
IT WAS ALL WORDS
AND NO ACTION.
HOPALONG CASSIDY,
ON THE OTHER HAND...
NOW THAT WAS
THE REAL THING.
SUNDAY, THE 3rd
OF SEPTEMBER, 1939.
EVERYONE WHO IS OLD ENOUGH
AND WAS THERE
REMEMBERS EXACTLY
WHAT THEY WERE DOING
AT THAT MOMENT.
I HAD JUST GUNNED DOWN
A COUPLE OF RUSTLERS.
I SLIPPED BACK
A FEW CENTURIES,
AND I WAS RIDING
THROUGH AN ENCHANTED FOREST
THE MAGICIAN MERLIN
SUDDENLY APPEARED BEFORE ME
AND MY HORSE
REARED UP IN TERROR.
THEN...
SOMETHING EVEN MORE
EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENED.
ALL THE SUNDAY MORNING
LAWN MOWERS SUDDENLY STOPPED.
ALL THE SUNDAY MORNING
LAWN MOWERS SUDDENLY STOPPED.
THIS IS LONDON...
YOU WILL NOW HEAR A STATEMENT
BY THE PRIME MINISTER.
I AM SPEAKING TO YOU
FROM THE CABINET ROOM
OF 10 DOWNING STREET.
THIS MORNING,
THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR
IN BERLIN
HANDED THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT
A FINAL NOTE STATING
THAT UNLESS WE HEARD
FROM THEM BY 11:00
THAT THEY WERE
PREPARED AT ONCE
TO WITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS
FROM POLAND,
A STATE OF WAR
WOULD EXIST BETWEEN US.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU NOW
THAT NO SUCH UNDERTAKING
HAS BEEN RECEIVED,
AND THAT, CONSEQUENTLY,
THIS COUNTRY IS AT WAR
WITH GERMANY.
?? FLAT-FOOT FLOOGIE
WITH THE FLOY FLOY ??
?? FLAT-FOOT FLOOGIE
WITH THE FLOY-- ????
STOP THAT, SUE!
SHE JUST SINGS IT.
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
WHERE ARE
MY STOCKINGS?
I CAN'T FIND
MY STOCKINGS!
THEY'VE STARTED
WAR AGAIN.
HAVE THEY?
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
I STILL NEED
MY STOCKINGS!
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR STOCKINGS!
IT'S AN AIR RAID!
GOOD GOD!
THEY'VE
STARTED ALREADY!
AIR RAID!
AIR RAID!
GET DOWN!
STAY DOWN!
GET DOWN!
STAY DOWN!
IT'S THE ALL-CLEAR.
OH!
TESTING.
THEY WERE
JUST TESTING.
WE ALL EXPECTED
TO BE BOMBED RIGHT AWAY,
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED
FOR AGES.
AND EVERYONE SAID,
"FANCY STARTING A WAR
ON SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY."
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL
DAY, TOO.
A FEW LAWN MOWERS
STARTED UP AGAIN,
BUT THEY DIDN'T
RING TRUE, SOMEHOW.
NOTHING WOULD EVER
BE THE SAME AGAIN.
NOTHING WOULD EVER
BE THE SAME AGAIN.
YOU GOING TO GIVE ME
A HAND, MAC, OR NOT?
DAD!
IT'S FULL
OF WATER AGAIN.
OH, BLAST!
AW!
COMES UP
THROUGH THE CLAY.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEALED IT OFF
WITH HOT PITCH, SMILER.
IT'S NOT FAIR.
IT'S SELFISH TO
KEEP THEM WITH YOU.
YOU REMEMBER THAT AUNT
I TOLD YOU ABOUT
IN AUSTRALIA?
SHE HAS
OFFERED TO HAVE THEM.
SNAP IT UP!
GREAT CHANCE
FOR THEM.
I MEAN, A LOT MORE
FUTURE OUT THERE.
SO FAR AWAY...
SO FAR AWAY...
I COULDN'T BEAR IT.
BUILDING
AIR RAID SHELTERS
IS HUNGRY WORK,
GRACE.
WELL, A FEW BOMBS MIGHT
WAKE UP THIS COUNTRY!
HA HA HA!
TAKE MORE
THAN A FEW BOMBS
TO WAKE UP DAWN
ON SUNDAY MORNING.
THIS PHONY WAR
GETS ON MY NERVES.
IF WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE A WAR,
I WISH THEY'D
GET IT STARTED.
JUST IGNORE HER, MAC.
THIS WAITING ABOUT'S
GETTING US ALL DOWN.
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT ABOUT
DO YOU REMEMBER
YOUR DRILL, MAC?
HUT! 2! 3!
ALL PRESENT
AND CORRECT, SIR!
YOU'VE KEPT THE OLD SAM BROWN
ALL THESE YEARS!
AND KEPT IT
POLISHED?
MIGHT COME IN USEFUL.
HA HA HA!
OOH!
STEADY, STEADY.
HAVING RECEIVED
HIS MAJESTY'S PERMISSION...
SHH! QUIET!
I HAVE FORMED
AN ADMINISTRATION
OF MEN AND WOMEN
OF EVERY PARTY
AND OF ALMOST
EVERY VIEWPOINT.
DAD!
SHH! SHH!
...TO WAGE WAR
UNTIL VICTORY IS WON,
AND NEVER TO
SURRENDER OURSELVES
TO SERVITUDE AND SHAME...
COME ON,
COME ON.
WHATEVER THE COST
AND THE AGONY MAY BE.
HA HA HA!
BLOODY GIN
ALWAYS MAKES ME...
CRY!
SHE ONLY WEEPS
WHEN SHE'S HAPPY.
OH, STOP IT,
MOLLY.
YOU'LL
START ME OFF.
GRACE, GRACE.
IT'S DUTY,
MAC.
IT'S HER DUTY.
WE DID OUR BIT
IN THE LAST LOT.
WHEN KING AND COUNTRY
CALL, MAC,
YOU'LL GO
AS SOON AS I WILL.
WHAT DID WE KNOW?
A COUPLE OF KIDS, 17.
I HEARD THE DRUM AND
FIFE YESTERDAY, MAC,
MARCHING PAST.
IT MADE MY HAIR
STAND ON END.
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO, MOLLY.
WE'VE BEEN ASLEEP
FOR 20 YEARS!
AW, GO TO HELL!
COME ON!
COME ON!
GOOD NIGHT,
MOLLY.
GOOD NIGHT.
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?
GO TO BED
THIS MINUTE!
GO TO BED
THIS MINUTE!
DON'T WORRY,
SUE.
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO BE LIKE THEM
WHENWEGROW UP.
WE'RE NOT EVEN
LIKE THEM NOW.
WE'RE NOT EVEN
LIKE THEM NOW.
WE'RE STANDING
IN THE POURING RAIN
OUTSIDE OF A ROAD
SQUELCHING WITH MUD
AND LINED WITH THE INEVITABLE
DOUBLE ROW OF POPLARS.
A FEW LORRIES ONLY
ARE SPLASHING BY
TO AND FROM
THE FORWARD AREAS,
BUT COMING DOWN THE ROAD
TOWARDS US
IS A BATTALION THAT I KNOW TO
BE OF A FAMOUS IRISH REGIMENT.
THEY'RE MARCHING IN THREES,
AND, IN THEIR FULL
BATTLE DRESS AND KIT,
THEY BLEND WITH THE BLOOMING
GREEN GRASS OF THE ROADSIDE...
FORWARD!
I RODE INTO BATTLE
WITH DRAWN SWORD
AGAINST THE TURKS.
WE DID OUR BIT
IN THE LAST LOT.
I HEARD THE DRUM
AND FIFE YESTERDAY
MARCHING PAST.
IT MADE MY HAIR
STAND ON END.
WHAT DID WE KNOW?
A COUPLE OF KIDS, 17.
I FOUGHT AGAINST THE TURKS,
MACHETES AGAINST ARTILLERY.
UNTIL VICTORY IS WON...
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
UNCLE MAC!
UNCLE MAC!
DAD.

IT'S LOVELY

IN THE DOOR.
YOU SILLY BEGGAR!
AHH!
WE'RE TRYING
TO WIN A WAR,
AND YOU SHUT YOUR
FINGERS IN A CAR DOOR!
AHH! MY HAND!
SORRY.
SORRY.
THAT'S IT,
FOR THE DURATION.

POP IN AND GIVE HER
A POLISH, BILLY BOY,
JUST NOW AND THEN.
A CAR NEEDS

A CAR NEEDS
TO BE CHERISHED.
HAS SUE
GOT IT RIGHT?
WHAT'S THAT?
YOU JOINED UP.
OH, THAT!
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE
TOLD ME YOURSELF.
OH, GRACE. IT'S
NOT FOR LONG.
THEY SAY IT'LL
BE OVER BY CHRISTMAS.
HEY!
NO. NO, LEAVE--
YES.
I DON'T WANT TO--
COME ON.
STOP IT!
STOP IT!
DON'T BE DAFT!
ACT YOUR AGE!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
I CAN'T COPE
ON MY OWN.
I CAN'T COPE
ON MY OWN.
I'D BETTER LET

OOH! OH!
HIYA!
OH!
OH!
BILLY,
BEFORE I GO,
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO TELL YOU.
YOU'RE NOT QUITE
OLD ENOUGH, BUT...
WELL...
WELL...
IT'S THE GOOGLIE.
YOUR HAND IS TOO
SMALL TO MASTER IT,
BUT YOU CAN
MAKE A START.
ANYWAY...
I'M GOING TO PASS
ON THE SECRET NOW,
FATHER TO SON,
IN CASE...
IN CASE ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ME.
IN CASE ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ME.
ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT?
NOW...
YOU KNOW
THE LEG BREAK, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW
THE LEG BREAK, RIGHT?
AND THE OFF BREAK?
AND THE OFF BREAK?
NOW, THE GOOGLIE
LOOKS LIKE A LEG BREAK,
BUT IT'S REALLY
AN OFF BREAK.
GOT IT?
LIKE THIS.
THAT'S LIKE
TELLING FIBS.
WHEN YOU
TELL A LIE,
YOU WANT TO
GET AWAY WITH IT.
BUT WHEN
SOMEONE ELSE DOES,
YOU WANT TO
FIND THEM OUT.
A GOOD BATSMAN
WILL SPOT A GOOGLIE.
A GOOD BOWLER WILL
HIDE IT.
ALWAYS REMEMBER
THAT, SON.
ALWAYS REMEMBER
THAT, SON.
GOOD-BYE, GRACE.

IT'S NOT LIKE
ANY JAM I KNOW.
IT'S GERMAN JAM!
WELL,
IT'S ALL RIGHT!
IT CAME FROM
A GERMAN SHIP--
GOT SUNK.
THIS STUFF
WASHED ASHORE.
OUR BOYS FOUND IT
ON THE BEACH.
WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
IT'S OFF-RATION.
WE KNOW THAT!
MAYBE THEY
PLANTED IT.
THEY KNOW WE
ARE MAD ON JAM.
THEY COULD POISON
THE COUNTRY!

COME AWAY.
I DON'T WANT YOU
STANDING TOO CLOSE.

JAM IS JAM!
IT'S JUST...
JAM!
I'M NOT
HAVING ANY,
EVEN IF IT'S
NOT POISONED.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
IT'S NOT
PATRIOTIC.
YOU DON'T
LIKE JAM.
YOU NEVER
EAT JAM.

THAT'S NOT
THE POINT.
TASTE IT!
WHY DON'T
YOU TASTE IT?
YOUTASTE IT.

GIVE US SOME,
DAD!
HA HA!
THAT'S IT!
COME ON.
YOU MEAN
THEY LET YOU GO
THROUGH THE OFFICER'S
TRAINING COURSE,
AND THEN SAID YOU WERE
TOO OLD FOR A COMMISSION?
THAT'S IT.
WHY DIDN'T THEY
SAY THAT BEFORE?
I WASN'T TOO OLD
WHEN I STARTED IT,
JUST WHEN
I FINISHED IT.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO BE, THEN?
A CLERK.
I'LL DO
A TYPING COURSE.
I SHALL BE
TYPING FOR ENGLAND.
OH!

MY WORST PROBLEM IS

TYPEWRITER RIBBON.
WHEN I RODE
AGAINST THE TURKS,
I KNEW

YOU THOUGHT YOU DID.
YOU THOUGHT YOU DID.
WE'VE BEEN GYPPED
ALL OUR LIVES, SMILER.
TAKE YOUR STREET.
WHAT ABOUT IT?
ROSE HILL AVENUE--
NO ROSES, NO HILL,
AND IT'S CERTAINLY
NOT AN AVENUE.
WHY NOT?
YOU NEED TREES
FOR AN AVENUE.
THERE WAS TALK
OF PLANTING SOME
WHEN WE FIRST CAME.
PROPAGANDA.
WE'VE BEEN HAD.
HOW'S YOUR WAR, MAC?
NEVER DONE BETTER.
ON THE FIDDLE,
SAME AS
EVERYONE ELSE.
EXCEPT THE SERVICEMEN.
NATURALLY.

KEEP AN EYE ON THEM
FOR ME, WILL YOU?
THERE'S A PAL.
I MADE A MESS
OF IT ALL.
I'VE BEEN
SUCH A BLOODY FOOL.
YOU ALWAYS WERE,
SMILER.

MUMMY KEEPS STILL
AND DADDY MOVES
ON TOP OF HER.
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
WHEN THEY KNOW HOW.
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
WHEN THEY KNOW HOW.
THAT WAS
SOME AIR RAID.
AIR RAID?
DIDN'T YOU FEEL
THE HOUSE ROCK?
YOU MUST'VE SEEN
THOSE SHELL BURSTS.

LET'S GET MARRIED.
WE CAN LIVE
IN MONTREAL.
I COULD
TEACH YOU FRENCH.

WE HAD A WEEK--
A WHOLE WONDERFUL WEEK.
THE MOST WONDERFUL
HONEYMOON
ANY COUPLE
EVER HAD.
I LOVE YOU

IT'S PATRIOTIC TO BE POOR.
WELL, I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING WITH
A LITTLE OOMPH.

OOH, I LOVE
A MAN IN BED.
THE SMELL OF HIM,

RUBBING AGAINST YOU,
THE WEIGHT OF HIM!
THEN WHEN THEY
DO IT TO YOU
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT
AND YOU'RE NOT SURE
IF YOU'RE DREAMING
OR IF IT'S HAPPENING.
OH, THAT'S THE BEST!
NO GUILTY FEELINGS.
NOT THAT I SHOULD
HAVE ANY WIDE AWAKE.
MOLLY!
WELL.
I'M NOT TALKING

WHAT'S THAT?
BIG BERTHA
SHELLING FRANCE.

WHO PAYS FOR THEM?

MAC, DID YOU
EVER FIND OUT
WHO MOLLY
WENT OFF WITH?
A POLISH PILOT.
SOUNDS LIKE A BAD JOKE
ON THE WIRELESS, HMM?
YOU MISS HER.
WELL, I KNOW I DO.
WELL, I KNOW I DO.
SHE SAID, "I KNOW
YOU LOVE ME, MAC,
BUT YOU NEVER
LOVED ME ENOUGH."
BUT YOU NEVER
LOVED ME ENOUGH."
HMM.
NOT LOVING ENOUGH.
IT'S A TERRIBLE THING
TO DO TO SOMEONE.
I SUPPOSE
I DID IT TO CLIVE.
I...
ALWAYS HELD
SOMETHING BACK.
ALWAYS HELD
SOMETHING BACK.
ALL BETTER LEFT
UNSAID, GRACE.
YOU WERE
NEVER APART,
YOU AND CLIVE.
HE KEPT ASKING

I KEPT WAITING

FOR YOU TO SAY
SOMETHING,
BUT YOU NEVER DID.
CLIVE HAD A JOB.
I DIDN'T.
I COULDN'T.
I COULDN'T.
WE DID
THE DECENT THING, GRACE.
WE DID
THE DECENT THING, GRACE.
THIS WAR HAS PUT AN END
TO DECENT THINGS.
WE CAN'T CHANGE
WHAT'S PAST.
NOT EVEN THE WAR
CAN DO THAT.
WE DID
THE PROPER THING,
BUT WE LOST LOVE,
AND THAT'S SAD, MAC.
AND THAT'S SAD, MAC.
DAWN!
DAWN!

YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A GRANDMA.
HELLO, GRANDMA!

I JUST DON'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING!
IT'S ONLY A HOUSE--

I SHALL TEACH YOU
THE WAYS OF THE RIVER.
ANOTHER YEAR
IN THAT AWFUL SUBURB,
AND YOU'D HAVE BEEN

WATT, AND AMP!
BASTARDS!

WITH STRAW BOATERS
AND BLAZERS.
THE PUNTS
ON THE RIVER
LIT WITH CHINESE LANTERNS,
LIKE FIREFLIES.
THROW THE POLE FORWARD.
LET IT SLIDE
THROUGH YOUR FINGERS.
DON'T PUSH UNTIL IT
HITS THE BOTTOM.
DON'T PUSH UNTIL IT

"WHAT CAN YOU DO
WITH FOUR DAUGHTERS?"
I ASKED MYSELF.
FOUR DAUGHTERS!
A STRING QUARTET WAS ALL
I COULD COME UP WITH.
THEY HATED ME
FOR MAKING THEM LEARN.
AND NOW WE'RE GLAD
YOU DID.
WELL, HERE'S TO MUSIC
AND ABSENT FRIENDS...

BRIDEGROOMS...
AND...THE BRIDE.
THE BRIDE!
THE BRIDE!
AND WAIT FOR IT...
HERE'S TO MY C.O.
HE'S WANGLED ME
A POSTING CLOSE TO HOME.
HE SAID, "YOUR HOUSE
BURNS DOWN,
"YOUR DAUGHTER
GETS MARRIED,
"YOU'RE ALWAYS AWAY
ON COMPASSIONATE LEAVE.
"PACK UP YOUR TYPEWRITER.
FIGHT THE BLOODY WAR
DOWN THERE!"
FIGHT THE BLOODY WAR
DOWN THERE!"
CLIVE,
I'VE FOUND THIS LITTLE
BUNGALOW TO RENT
DOWN THE TOW-PATH.
I NEVER WANT TO LEAVE
THE RIVER AGAIN.
THE CHILDREN HAD
SUCH A WONDERFUL SUMMER.
FAIR ENOUGH.
THE RIVER.
THE RIVER!
THE RIVER!
AND LOYAL FRIENDS
AND GOOD
AND FAITHFUL WIVES--
WE HOPE AND TRUST--
AND GRUMPY GRANDFATHERS.
SINCE YOU'RE SHORTLY

I THROW DOWN
THE GAUNTLET.
A CRICKET MATCH--YOU AND MAC
AGAINST BILL AND ME. ON?
OOH!
OOH!
UGH!
MAC PLAYED
FOR SURREY SECONDS,
AND I OPENED
FOR THE INDIAN ARMY.

A THOUSAND TIMES.
CLASS WILL TELL.
IT'S AN OLIVE BRANCH.
TAKE IT. IT'S THE BEST
HE CAN DO. COME ON.
YOU'RE BATTING FIRST.
I ALWAYS GET
THE STACCATO WRONG.
IT WAS ME.
SHE'S NOT FEELING
TOO GOOD.
OH, DARLING!

A GOOD PLAYER.

THE YOU-KNOW-WHAT.
ALL RIGHT, GRANDPA.
ALL RIGHT, GRANDPA.
THAT WAS A GOOGLIE!
A GOOGLIE?
YOU DIDN'T
SPOT IT, CLIVE.
I TAUGHT HIM HOW. NOW
HE TURNS IT AGAINST ME.
THE LAW OF LIFE'S
CRUEL, ISN'T IT?
YOU WICKED OLD
GUVNER.
WELL DONE, LAD!
OOF!
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

THIS IS NOT THE END.
NO, THIS IS NOT EVEN
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
BUT IT IS, PERHAPS,
THE END OF THE BEGINNING.
I SCRUMPED IT.
I NEARLY GOT CAUGHT.
THEY CHASED ME
FOR AGES!
OH, YOU DID THAT
FOR ME?

OF YOUR HOLIDAYS?
WELL, FOR THE BABY,
