Huh?.
You stepped over the line,
miss.
Uh, it's Ms.
**
Sorry, Ms., but, um--
I meant to.
You're not
supposed to do that.
Or the photos.
That's why
I tried it.
Why?.
To see what would happen.
Well, uh,
I mean,
I'm what happens.
I-I ha-- I have to walk over,
like I've done, and askyou
to take a step back.
And ifi someone doesn't,
what then?.
I'm not sure.
I've never had anyone
not step back.
I've only said it, like, fiour times,
and every time they've done it.
What ifiI'm your fiirst?.
Non-stepper, I mean. Then what?.
Look, I'm ofifiin 1 0 minutes.
I'd probablyjust stand here,
make sureyou didn't touch anything.
Really?.
Prettymuch.
Yeah-- No, I'd let
the next shifit talk toyou,
kickyou out, orwhatever.
You wouldn't grab me
or anything?.
You're not gonna mess up
myweekend with this,
areyou?.
I wasn't planning on it,
but I'm not completely
against it either.
See, ifiyou get all crazy,
then I gotta write up
a report and stufifi.
I'm here till 5:00, 5:30 easy,
and I have a second job
to get to-- the video store.
Oh, that's where I--
I've seen you in there.
You helped me once, I think.
Yeah?. With what?.
The Picture ofDorian Gray.
You fiound it in " Drama,"
not "Classics."
Right!
I remember that!
Somebodymisplaced it.
Yes!
Yeah, behind Cabaret.
Mmm.
That's funny.
Anyway, you helped me.
That was... nice.
Thanks.
But you're not gonna
return the fiavor, right?.
You mean, step back over--
No, I-I'm-- I'm sorry.
I can't.
Whyis that?
It's a pretty good-sized
sculpture.
You could see it
just fiine firom here.
Truthfully?
I'm gonna deface the statue.
Oh.
Uh, is that paint?
Yes, it is.
Great.
Hey, uh, paint's
not really a great thing
to bring into a museum.
Why do you have that?.
I'm gonna do something
to the nude.
What, like, color it?.
I'm thinking more ofi
painting a big dick on it.
Oh.
And would "Why??" be completely
out ofithe question here?.
- Because I don't like art
that isn't true.
- True?.
This sculpture,
it's fiake, it's not real.
Therefiore, fialse art.
No, it's a Fornicelli.
It defiinitely is.
I read the little thingie there
one time.
Yes, but the leafiisn't.
It's not?
Well, what is it?
A pastie orsomething,
like strippers have?
It's plaster...
that was added by
a committee who had complaints
firom local townspeople.
Really?.
I didn't know that.
Theytook issue with his thing--
you know, the shape ofit.
Said it was too lifielike.
It's supposed to be God.
You know, that's what
pisses them ofifi.
Look.
See, it's right behind
the leafi there.
You can just see his--
Twig.
Yeah, but they didn't
even cover it properly.
It's shoddy crafitsmanship.
I mean, ifiyou're gonna do it,
at least do it--
Exactly. Do it right.
So, you're a student, then,
or is this just basic anarchy?.
Student.
Me too.
What's your emphasis?.
Taking out school loans,
mostly.
But I do sit in on
a fiew English classes.
You're in art?.
Mm-hmm. MFA.
Oh.
Applied Theory and Crit.
So, is this, like, a project,
then, or--
No, I am just getting started
on my thesis project now.
It's a big sort ofi
installation... thingie.
That's a good word, huh?.
"Thingie."
It is.
Anyway, this is just...
an idea I had.
You're cute.
I don't likeyour hair.
Thanks... I think.
No, you're defiinitely cute,
butyou should--
you should do
something with it,
your hair.
Okay.
I-I'll try that.
Your relies late.
Yeah. Typical.
Yeah, so doyou have to
stay atyour station
until they spell you, or--
Oh, no, no. At punch-out time
I'm supposed to
get down there and do it.
They can really be pricks
about that.
Oh, you should go, then.
Yeah.
Can I call you?.
What doyou want to call me?.
Um...just up...
fior right now.
I mean, talk.
Maybe get crazy.
Um, take you to dinner?.
Okay.
Uh, sure.
Do they... allow you
to do that here?.
What, eat dinner?.
I meant, hit on the patrons.
Uh, no.
They've got a pretty strict policy
about that too actually.
But--
Ah. The great equalizer.
" But."
Exactly.
I'll take the risk.
Good answer, Grasshopper.
What?.
Kung Fu. On TV?
Remember when he was a kid,
there was an old guy
with fiakey contact lenses--
Right!
Grasshopper.
I don't reallywatch
much television.
Yeah.
So, doyou want
a number?
Hmm?. Oh, God.
Absolutely.
Oh, dang it.
I don't have a pen.
Me either.
Here.
What?
Give me the jacket.
Hmm?. Oh.
Uh-- Uh--
That's my own.
That's not
part ofithe unifiorm.
That's mine.
Good. Nowyou'll
always have it on you.
Great.
Yeah.
- So, I'll call you?.
- Yeah.
It was nice
to meetyou... again.
You too.
You can defiinitely tell.
You can.
- Really.

Twenty bucks.
Okay.
- I mean, I can't tell, so I fiigured--
- That's becauseyou seeyou every day,
shower, getting dressed--
- So doyou.
- I don't seeyou shower
or getting dressed.
I meant everyday.
So far, anyways.
I know. I'm kidding.
Oh.
I'd like that, though,
ifi... you would.
What?.
Showering and...
getting dressed, you know--
Both, ifiyou want.
Either. Anything.
Any moment I can get with you.
That's what I'd like.
Ask and you shall receive.
So I'm asking, then.
Soyou shall be

PDA.
What?.
Public display ofiafifiection.
Oh.
I'm not used to that.
No?.
I don't mind.
Really?.
Nah.
Whose business is it?.
Ours, right?.
Kiss ifiwe want to.
Make love in a bathroom stall.
Who cares?.
I'd start with
the administration.
Why should they?.
We're two adults.
We know what we're doing.
I think this is a bigger discussion
than befioreJenny and Philip get here.
Whatever.
Oh, no, I mean--
I'd love to have it with you--
uh, the discussion.
And I agree... somewhat.
I understand.
No, another time
we'll defiinitely discuss it.
"Another time."
I'd rather do it.
We'll, let me go
check the men's room.
You amaze me.
And you amaze me.
You do. Look atyou.
It's just a littlejogging.
I'm very proud ofiyou.
Thankyou...
Henry Higgins.
What's that?.
That's from a book.
Well, it's a play actually.
Not the one we're seeing,
though, is it?.
No, we're... seeing Medea.
Oh,yeah, right.
I read this as an undergrad.
I like it.
Should I be nervous?.
No, not too much.
I mean, unless we have kids.
Now, what about you?.
What about me?.
I don't know
anything aboutyou.
Yes, you do.
I don't. Not really.
- Where am I firom?.
- Illinois, near Chicago.
- Sign.
- Gemini, I think.
- The twins, yes.

a split personality?.
No, it means
I was born in June.
Ah. Okay.
Anything elseyou wanna know?.
Why doyou like me?.
- What?.
- Whywould you like me?.
I'm not anything. I mean--
Don't do that, okay?.
That's the only thing aboutyou
I don't like.
Whatyou see in yourself
or don't see.
Fuckin' insecurities.
Sorry.
Doyou like me?.
Ofi course.
And do I appear
to likeyou?. Huh?.
Yeah.
I mean,
it seems like it, yes.
I do likeyou.
Do I seem to know

No question.
So don'tyou trust me, then,
to know how I fieel?.
Yeah-- No, you're right--
I mean,
don't worry about "why..."
when... "what"
is right in firont ofiyou.
Those are verywise words...
firom someone
with such a great ass.
Kiss me...
Grasshopper.
Ah-ah-ah!
PDA.
I don't think anybodywants
to watch you kiss, Adam.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Phil.
Hello.
Hi.
Hey!
Evelyn,
this is Philip.
Hello.
Hi.
And his fiiancée,Jenny.
Hi.
Hey.
So, should we
grab our tickets?.
Adam,
what's up with you?.
Did you
lose weight?.
Um... a little,
maybe.
No, it's--
He cut his hair or something.
That's it, right?.
Right.
Yeah, well, uh, both,
sort ofi.
Huh.
Okay, so, let's, uh--
Come on.
Oh.
**
Come on.
**
**
**
So tell me this again.
You guys are gonna--
Underwater.
We're gonna get married
underwater.
You gotta be kidding me.
Like in those Life magazine
photos you see, orwhatever.
Is that, like,
a... Califiornia thing?.
No. We wanted
to trysomething bold.
That oughta do it.
That is crazy. Really.
So ifiwe want to attend,
we have to--
Get in the tank with us.
You bet.
- No. Honey, I thought
we said the guests--
- U h, we haven't--
We haven't settled
that part completely.
That is nuts.
No, I applaud you.
I think it is very bold.
Yeah, well,
don't expect my buddy here
to fiollow in our fiootsteps.
He's the least adventurous
person I know.
Really?
Absolutely.
Oh, and the marriage thing?
Uh-uh.
It's not gonna happen. Sorry.
I don't know how manynights
I listened to this guysay,
" Not me, man.
I'm never gettin' hooked.
No way, man."
Well, well!
Listen, don't encourage him.
My roomie doesn't need
any more encouragement.
Former roommate.
You're gonna lookstupid
in one ofthose wet suits.
-
- Hey, let's not be
a party pooper, my firiend.
This could have
been yours.
Oh, Phil, stop being--
Adam and I had a class together,
and he never got up the nerve
to ask me out.
I'm borrowing his pen,
like, all the time--
hint, hint--
and he's this total monk
the whole semester.
Anyway, Phil picks him up
from class one day, sees me,
and we went to mini golf
that same night.
I cannot tell a lie.
I got the moves,
God help me.
Whoo!
God help all ofi us.
Well, like I said,
I think it's great.
It's really amazing-- it is--
to fiind anybodywilling
to take a risk these days,
to look a little silly
or dififierent or anything.
Bravo.
To people with balls.
To balls.
Long may theywave.
I'll tellyou
what tooksome balls.
That museum thing
a fiew weeks back,
with the balls.
Did you guys
read about that?.
Oh, Adam, ofi course you did.
You were supposed
to be guarding it.
But, uh--
Evelyn, didyou hear
about it?
-  The penis.
-  Yes, I did.
Why are we whispering?.
Becauseyou don't say "penis"
inJenny's house.
But we're at my place now,
so we sing it firom the eaves.
* Penis, penis *
Bar's closed.
Last call.
- * Penis, penis *
- Nice.
Seriously, though,
canyou believe that shit?
Somebody with the gall to pull
that kind ofi bullshit on our campus?.
Fuckin' burns me up.
Shh.
I'm an artist, so...
Maybe we should--
I don't really have
the same reaction as--
I mean, this isn't Berkeley.
What does that mean anyway--
" I'm an artist"?.
Mmm, nothing.
It means nothing really.
Just that
I understand the impulse.
You what?.
Um, Evelyn,
we shouldprobably--
No, no. Wait, Adam.
I wanna hear.
What impulse?.
It's called vandalism.
Uh, does anybody
want dessert?.
Hold on.
This is rich. Go ahead.
Just that, um, I don't think
it was just kids playing.
I think it was
a sort ofi statement, a kind ofi--
- Statement?.
- Yeah, I do.
What kind ofstatement
would that be?
It was pornography.
- Oh, no, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.
No. Pornography is meant
to titillate, to excite you.
- Did you see a picture
ofiwhat happened?.
- We did,yeah.
Anddoes a penis exciteyou?
I mean, just any old penis?.
Uh, you're fiunny,
and that's not the point.
It's totally the point!
How about you,Jenn?.
Did you like whatyou saw?.
Did it getyou hot?.
This is, like,
uncalledfor, okay?
- All she said was--
- I know what she said.
Why don't you let her speak?.
Did you wanna say
anything else?. Huh?.
Okay.
Then, look, all I'm--
I'm saying is that,
in my opinion,
it wasn't pornography,
it was a statement.
Wow.
The postgraduate mind at work.
You know, Istill don'tsee
how that makes it a statement.
- What do you mean?.
- It's grafifiiti.
It would be a huge statement,
especially fior a town like this.
Which "Take Back the Night" rally
did you fiind her at, Adam?.
You're really
the obnoxious type.
You know that?
I mean, how long did you
have to stomach this guy?.
Evelyn--
Anyhow, who knows what
the person was saying by it.
We don't.
But I think it was a gesture,
a kind ofi manifiesto, ifiyou will--
W-W-Wait.
I don't think a person's dick
can be a manifiesto. Uh-uh.
You can write a manifesto
on yourthing,
but your thing can't be one.
I'm sure I read that somewhere.
See, you're just
trying to be really--
Hey, I'm not trying to be anything.
Who the hell do you thinkyou are?.
A fiew double dates,
and telling me anything
about who I am.
- Un-fiucking-believable!
- Okay, this is getting a little--
Adam,
you can really pick 'em.
Let's just fiorget the whole--
You are not gonna take
his side in this, areyou?.
No.
Jesus!
I'm just trying to get out ofihere
with a touch ofi dignity.
I've got a test tomorrow
anyway.
"Statement."
Just shut the fiuck up!
Fuck right ofifi.
How would you know?.
I think she was making one.
So, that's my opinion.
Jenny,
thanks fior everything.
Yeah, how'd you know
it was a girl?.
I don't.
I just said.
It's a guess--
what it was,
where it was placed.
An educated guess.
Oh, you're not--
She's not trying to take a poke
at my being an undergrad, is she?.
Okay, can we just
stop this now, please?.
Adam, tell me she didn't just--
Hey, artiste,
how did you know it was a woman
who painted the cock?.
Very, very suspicious there.
You're such a prick.
Man, how doyou go on
day afiter day?.
Let's go.
Adam,
are you coming?.
Yeah.
I'll meetyou out firont?.
I just wanna--
Okay.
You're very sweet.
Good luck.
"Good luck"?.
Hey, fiuckyou!
Oh, come on, m-man!
Where in hell
did you meet that bitch?.
At the museum.
What, did she giveyou
a haircut and a blow job,
nowyou're her puppy?.
Phil!
I'm not her puppy!
The wedding sounds great.
Really, it sounds-- Yeah.
You don't
have to leave.
Wereyou...
always like this befiore?.
So...
you know.
Shy?.
Mm-hmm.
Just about the fiact
that no one would ever
sleep with me. That's all.
Come on!
No, seriously.
I mean, you're, like,
I don't know,
only the third person
I've ever--
Really?.
Yeah.
I mean it.
And theywere
both young.
I mean,
I was too.
I wasn't, like, hanging out
by a day care or anything.
It was during
high school, mostly.
Hmm.
Soyou're sort ofi
in uncharted waters here.
I don't wanna
blowyour cover, but...
I could kinda tell.
Yeah?.
Yeah.
Well, that's okay.
Nobody here at school?.
Well,
nothing serious.
Dates.
Some close calls.
But not anyone,
you know--
LikeJenny?.
No, no.
Areyou sorry
you didn't ask her out?.
Hmm?. I mean, ifi--
ifil wasn't
in the equation.
Not really.
Hmm.
We just never
got the right--
What--
I sort ofiblew that one.
Anyway, it's kinda weird
talking about it now that--
That's okay.
You know, it's nice to see,
every so ofiten, someone... gallant.
So, did you enjoy
tonight?.
Uh-huh.
Dinnerwas great.
The trip into the city--
that was fiun.
I likeyour car.
I meant the perfiormance.
Oh, right, that.
Um--
Not really.
Well...
that's all right.
That's fiine.
Oh, no, it's not that
I didn't enjoy it. It was okay.
You didn't think
it was amazing?.
I thought itwas amazing
that the cops didn't bust in
and stop her.
Oh, come on!
How could you not fiind that moving,
what shewas doing?.
Easy.
I mean, granted,
I usually love it when a woman
removes her tampon in firont ofi me.
- Very sexy.
- It's not supposed to be sexy.
I was joking.
You know that.
I mean,Jesus,
it's an expression ofiherself
as an artist, as a woman,
a person.
I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.
Me either.
You didn't get it.
That's all.
No, that's not true.
Wejust don't agree. That's all.
- I wanted to I i ke it.
- Then why didn't you?.
Maybe because she was
fiinger painting portraits ofi her daddy
using menstrual blood.
She... is completely influential,
totallyvanguard.
To me, it was nasty, it was private,
and I fielt like it was something
I wasn't supposed to be seeing.
She allowedyou to though.
She allowed you into herworld,
into herwork,
but in a highly theatrical way.
Exactly my point.
It's called theater, not therapy.
No, it's called
perfiormance art!
- It's called her period!
- It's called your taste up your ass!
Did we just have
our fiirst fiight?.
I think so.
Yeah, we did.
Cool.
Better mark it down
in our diaries.
Yeah.
Hey.
We can do that-- fiight.
That's good.
Why good?.
'Cause, um,
now we get to make up.
Were you nervous befiore?.
I mean, about us
with the video.
Oh, not really.
A bit.
Sure.
Yeah. It's just,
let's not watch it. Okay?.
Do we have to do that?.
Not ifiyou don't want to.
Good.
'Cause I don't think I could
get into that actually.
See, I'm totally dififierent.
I think everyone should
see themselves doing it,
and their firiends
should see it too.
That's why the tape's
going back to my place.
Don't be so firightened ofi everything.
I'm not.
I'm not firightened anyway.
I just don't think that's
a thing other people
need to see, ever-- my ass.
People like who?. Philip?.
No, that's fiine.
You can show him.
Areyou crazy?.
Why is heyour firiend?.
Oh, God, you don't
wanna go over all that.
I just don't thinkyou need
that kind ofi person in your lifie.
I mean, no one does.
It-- It may be a touch early
to start dictating
who my firiends are.
Yeah... I suppose.
Boy, he really got under
your skin, didn't he?.
Under, over, around.
I hate that kind ofi guy.
What kind?.
That kind.
Whatever he is,
that's what I hate.
I'll let him know.
No! God, no.
Don't give him the satisfiaction.
And he'd take it too.
Believe me.
I don't know.
Maybe it would help him,
you know, be better or something.
The only thing that would help him
is a fiuckin' knifie through his throat.
Okay, I'm glad I don't have
a pet rabbit or anything.
You know what I mean.
Um... no, not really.
I've just been around his type,
that's all, and I don't like him.
Yeah, I got that part.
No big deal.
Right. No, itwas
the "knifie through the throat" part
thatwas the big deal, I thought.
Oh, that's just an expression.
From where?.
Transylvania?.
No.
From the Scorned Girl's Handbook.
Oh, yeah, page 666.
You've been peeking.
You know what happens
to peekers, don't you?.
Well, ifi they're deejays,
they usually get asked to play " Misty"
on the radio all the time.
Close.
No, I'll showyou.
Butyou have to
do me a fiavor.
What's that?.
Just... smile.
Smile into the camera...
fior as...
Iong as you can.
Jenny!
Adam! Hi!
Hey.
Hi.
Oh!
So--
Thanks fior coming.
I appreciate it.
Ofi course.
How's it going?.
You know... okay.
Right.
Lots to do
fior a wedding.
I bet.
Yeah. Invitations to get out,
arrangements to make.
Air tanks to fiill.
That too.
Soyou guys are still
going through with that, huh?.
That's what we're saying.
- What doyou mean, "saying"?.
- No, no, no. We are.
It's what we're doing.
I just--
-Jenny, what?.
- I don't know.
I'm just, you know, worried.
Why?
About what?.
What doyou think?
Philip.
He's just, I don't know,
being fiunny.
- Funny how?.
-J ust kinda fiunny odd.
Like nice.
Nice?
Yeah. You know, sweet?.
Now, I love him and all.
I do. You know that.
But that is not the way I would
describe him to people-- sweet.
Would you?.
I wouldn't exactly use his name
and "sweet" in the same...
short story.
And that's
what's bugging me.
I mean, he's only been like this
once befiore, maybe twice.
But defiinitely once,
when we were fiirst going out
and he was seeing somebody else.
You rememberthat?
Yeah. I do.
The other one.
The otherJenny. Exactly.
I'd call and I could hear him
fireeze up, you know,
get allsort of... sweet,
fiish around slowly
until he fiigured out
ifi it was her or me.
God, I used to hate that.
Maybe I'mjust
making it all up,you know?
I mean, my own insecurities
and looking fior a reason to not--
Dive in?
- Take the plunge?.
- Oh, God!
Jump ofifi the deep end?.
Stop me befiore I--
Cute, but yes.
That might be it,
but I don't think so.
I mean, I wanna get married.
I do.
Even ifiit is underwater.
And I love the guy,
whether he's sweet or not.
It's just, I don't believe him
now that he is.
Well, you got me.
Really?. I mean,
you don't know anything?.
Haven't fielt that?.
I only see him, like, once a week
in our survey course, so it's not like
I'm in the inner circle anymore.
I know. I just thought
that maybeyou'd tell me
ifiyou knew something.
But I would tell you,Jenny.
I would. Seriously.
Really?.
I think so.
I mean-- Oh, look,
that's a lousy thing
to pass on to a person.
And ifil did, you know,
know something
and then told you,
you'd more likely
hate me fiorever
than be gratefiul.
Yeah,
that's probably true.
Um, you could lie.
Feel firee.
No, you're probably right.
So that doesn't exactly make me
want to come clean here.
Which I have nothing
to come clean about, okay?.
Honestly.
It's just--
I-I just fieel
that I would.
I-I do.
Because I think
you're pretty amazing...
ifthe, uh, truth be known.
And you're almost married,
so why shouldn't it be?.
Uh, the truth, I mean.
Thankyou.
Not a problem.
Anyway,
that's all I know.
Which is nothing.
Okay!
Hwah!
I'm just being stupid.
Hey.
Ifiyou fieel it,
it's not stupid.
God!
You're a lovely person.
You know that?.
" Lovely"?.
Jesus, why don'tyou just
call me gay and get it overwith?.
Hey!
Lovely is nice.
No, I wish there were
a fiew more lovely people
in the world.
I mean it. You are.
And getting cuter by the day.
What is that girl doing toyou?.
Lots.
She's amazing. Really.

Areyou wearing--
No! Adam!
Are those contacts?.
Yep.
Contacts.
Oh, my God.

That was only fior, like, a week!
That one time!
I know, but still,
you gotta admit--
I do. It's great.
I fieel better.
" Better."
I mean, you're, like,
this totally hot guy now.
No.
No, I mean, I always thought
you were handsome befiore, but...
I didn't thinkyou'd go in
fior the makeover thingie.
Me either.
Who knew?.
Well, apparently she did.
You are still seeing her,
aren'tyou?.
Oh, yeah. She's--
You don't hold a grudge, doya?.
All she said that night--
Oh, God,
I couldn't believe that!
No, it was great.
No, truthfiully, it was.
I mean, Phil needed to hear
everyword ofithat.
He did, too.
Hear it, I mean.
You know, he even said something
afiteryou guys lefit.
I mean, not an admittance
ofi guilt, exactly,
but as close to one
as we're likely to hear
firom the guy.
Really?. What'd he say?.
I'm amazed.
As was I.
He put on quite the show.
I remembervaguely.
They both did.
Anyway, later on
he said something like,
" He could do worse."
Not exactly
a seal ofi approval.
No, but a lot fior him.
And afiterwhat she said?.
You're right.
Huh.
Hey, her middle name's
notJenny or anything, is it?.
No such luck.
Whew!
No, it's Ann.
Evelyn Ann Thompson.
It's nice, right?.
Eat?.
What?.
Eat.
Those are her initials.
The acronym ofiher name
is E-A-T.
Hey, that's cute.
Oh, God, you're a goner.
I know.
It's pathetic, isn't it?.
Somewhat.
But lovely.
No, not that again!
What the heck is this?.
What is this?.
What?.
Did you stop biting your nails?.
Yeah, fior, like,
a month now.
Don't tell me she--
It's true.
She gave me some kind ofi crap
to put on 'em, and that was it.
I just stopped.
You have nails!
This is crazy!
It's no biggie.
The whole time I've known you--
threeyears now--
your fiingers have looked
like raw meat.
Anyway, awfiul.
And nowyou just quit.
This girl is the messiah.
I've quit befiore.
For, like, an hour.
I love this woman.
Me too.
Yeah, I can see that.
Wow.
And you'd really tell me
ifiyou knew something?.
I would, yes.
Okay.
Geez, when did you
get so cute?.
Whew.
Shit.
Yeah.
What was that all about?.
I don't know.
Uh, I'm not sure.
Look, I'm sorry.
No. Don't be.
I am.
Uh, I'm the one
with the ring on.
Yeah, it's...
my firiend's ring.
Good point.
Thanks fior reminding me.
You're welcome.
Aw, dang it!
Oh, no, listen,
it wasn't because ofi,
you know, myworries orwhatever,
how I'm fieeling about Philip right now.
It wasn't.
Okay.
It just--
Happened.
Right.
I've wanted to do that
fior a long time.
Threeyears.
Me too.
Now we take it
down to the-- the beach
and bury it.
Don't we?.
Yeah, we do.
Ofi course.
Um...
don't you want to?.
Bury it?.
Yes. Or--
No. No, we can't
talk about it.
Don't even say the--
God. Do you have
a shovel in your car?.
Uh, I don't, no.
But... I have my car.
My bike's
right over there.
Then it... should be fiine
ifiwe were to...
go to the beach.
I suppose so.
Good.
Oh, come on.
We should go bury this.
On the beach.

What ti me did they say?.
I t's 1 0:50 now.
No big deal.
You always wait
at the doctor's ofifiice.
I know. I just had to be
at work by 1 2:00.
Today?.
Yeah, I told you that.
No, you didn't.
Yeah, I did.
I always workWednesdays.
Really?.
Yeah. EveryWednesday.
Hmm.
It's okay.
I can be late ifil have to.
Areyou sure?.
Yeah.
I mean, they hate it,
but I'll come up with something.
Orwe can go.
No.
I wanna do this. I do.
I mean, w-whowouldn'twant
to pay a lot ofimoney
to get their nose chopped ofifi?.
Well,you're onlytalking to them
anyway. That's all.
It's just weird to think--
People do it
all the time.
Especially out here.
Right.
No, you're right. You're right.
- I just never imagined myself
to be one ofi those people.
- I'm one ofi those people.
What?. You are not.
Take a look.
Where?
I don't see anything.
Exactly.
You got your nose done?.
Honestly?.
Sixteen.
My parents' birthday present.
Thoughtfiul.
I asked fior it.
I had this terrible hook.
The Jewish slope,
we called it
in Lake Forest.
The only ski run
fior miles around.
I can't believe it.
I can't tell.
That's the idea, isn't it?.
You could be lying to me.
What would be
the point ofithat?.
To get me in here.
To watch chunks ofi my flesh
get torn away.
You could be a sadist
fior all I know.
Hey, quit sweet-talking me.
God, they did
an amazing job.
Mmm.
Wait a minute.
Your name's Thompson.
That's notJewish.
On my mother's side, you dope.
That's what makes meJewish.
Her maiden name is Tessman.
Oh.
We don't have to
stayhere, Adam.
No, it's okay.
It just makes me jumpy.
It's cosmetic,
not corrective.
Lots ofi guys do it.
It's no big deal. I promise.
Well, ifi it's cosmetic,
maybe I should just
put some powder on it.
You know,
I thinkyou'll look great.
You have a good fiace.
A nice shape toyour nose,
actually,
but it'sjust got
that bit of--
What?.
Bulb.
At the end. I mean--
Well, not a bulb exactly,
but more ofi a--
No, I get it.
Sort ofi a Rudolph efifiect.
PDA.
Indeed.
Shall I go
check the men's room?.
- I dareyou.
- Shut up.
I'm serious.
Is this, like, mylast meal
orsomething?
A conjugal visit
befiore I'm drawn and quartered?.
Stop being so morbid.
It's just flesh.
Yeah, I see
whatyou mean.
It's just flesh.
That's not morbid at all.
It isn't.
You've bitten more skin off
from aroundyourfingernails...
than a doctor would ever
trim offyour nose.
It's true.
How'd you get that scar
on your back?.
Which?. The--
Yes, the raised one.
A kid, um, threw a stick
at me, fiirst grade.
Stitches?.
Yeah. Thirty-three.
And is that terrible?.
Areyou disfiigured
because ofiit?.
Well... I don't like
to wear tank tops.
What's the matterwith scars?.
Not a thing.
Did you try to--
No. Not really.
I mean, I cut on myselfi a little,
tried to get attention
when I was a teenager,
but I didn't wanna
slit myveins open.
So, is myarm unattractive toyou then
because ofthose, ornot?
No, not at all.
I love your arm.
It's beautifiul.
They're like rings on a tree.
They signify experience,
make us unique.
I can see that.
And that's all this is.
The idea ofiyou
having some surgery.
It's an experience.
I know.
It just makes me--
What? Nervous?
"It's a fiar, fiar better thing I do
than I have ever done."
Something like that.
Is that firom a book?.
Yeah. Dickens.
Ah! So...
are you gonna go check?.
What?.
What, the restroom?.
Uh-huh.
What ifithey call my name though?.
Seriously.
What ifithey do?.
I smell trouble...
Mmm.
which I may not be able
to do afiter this.
Just go.
All right.
Then I can
showyou something.
What?.
Hmm?. Oh, nothin'.
No, uh,
just a little something
I had done... fioryou.
Wait. No. Show me now.
It's a big religious no-no.
Nice, huh?.
"Eat."
Let me guess.
You couldn't afifiord the "me."
No, you goofi.
It's your initials.
Doyou like it?.
I do.
I like it.
I'm serious.
It looks good.
Just shut up. Don't get here late
and then make fiun ofi me.
- No. You look distinguished.
- Phil.
I look like a hockey player.
Yeah, but a distinguished one.
What'd you do anyway?.
I fiell.
Come on.
What?.
Seriously. I did.
You sound like a battered wifie.
I fiell.
That's not fiunny.
Yeah, it is. It's very fiunny.
I mean, it's not that fiunny
that wives get beat up,
but the fiact thatyou look like one--
that I fiind hilarious.
Well, that's what happened.
I tripped, I fiell. No big deal.
You really fiell?.
Yeah.
I, uh, tripped going up the--
You know?.
No. What?.
The... thingie.
I hit the edge ofithe--
You know.
No. It's "the edge ofithe"
that I'm a little hazy on here.
The edge ofithe knob--
my doorknob.
You really tripped?.
Truthfiully?.
Yes. God.
Huh.
Okay.
Why do you say that-- "Huh"?.
- What, you don't believe me?.
- No. I just--
I saw your girlfiriend
the other day,
maybe what, last Thursday.
You weren't in class.
I asked her ifyou were okay. That's all.
Yeah?. So?.
And she said yes, but you were recovering
firom an operation or something.
What?.
That's what I said.
Then she said it wasn't really
an operation, perse,
just some thing you had done--
a "procedure."
That was it.
So Ijust thought,
No.
I don't know, whatever.
I -I hurt it. Really. I hit it-- You know,
I banged it up pretty bad at home.
So I had the doctor
take a look at it, but he
didn't operate or anything.
So where'd you see her?.
I don't know.
Starbucks or somewhere--
the mall maybe.
She doesn't drink cofifiee.
So it was downtown then.
Record City, I think.
Wh-What, you worried
I'm gonna steal her?.
No.
God. Don't be so--
Believe me.
-  Ugh!
- Anyway, it's gonna be fiine.
Well, that's good to hear.
Yeah.
And, uh,
you'd tell me ifi there was
anything seriouslywrong.
Ofi course.
Hey, what's up?.
I mean, we're firiends,
right?.
You'd come to me.
About what?.
- Phil, what's--
-Jenny told me.
Jenny told you what?.
She kissed you.
- Oh.
- She fielt shitty, I guess.
I could tell fior, like, a week
somethin' was goin' on.
And then finally
she toldme about it.
She did.
I mean, she did do that,
but it-it was nothing.
No. I don't mean nothing, no.
Uh, it meant nothing.
It didn't hold any meaning fior us.
For "us"?. Okay, so you
can speak fior her then?.
Itjust happened.
For me. It didn't fior me.
It was just a--
And that's all she said?.
- Don't tell me there's more.
- No. God, no, not at all. No.
It's all right.
I'd been acting weird lately.
This whole... marriage idea
is just fireaky, so--
It's my fiault, I guess.
Sorry.
It's better than me
having to kiss you.
- Good point.
- No tongue, right?.
- Oh,Jesus!
- I'm just asking.
No. Please.
Well, I got a 3:1 0.
So long, Romeo.
Where's yourjacket?.
What?.
Okay, this is, uh...
too much.
The cord jacket?.
The lumberjacky-lookin' thing?.
I don't know.
Uh-huh.
And this, uh,
Tommy Hilfiiger-ish job--
Where'd you come up
with that?.
The mall. I bought it.
- What's the big deal?.
- That's, like, a sailing slicker.
She likes it.
It's reversible.
Well, isn't that just neat?.
What I want to know is,
do you like it?.
It's okay.
Uh-huh.
Let me askyou this.
Did you get to keep the cord job,
or did she make you toss it?.
- Who cares?. God--
- Huh?.
I threw it out, okay?.
Goodwill, actually.
"Goodwill, actually."
It's no big thing.
Dude, don't just say
"no big thing."
I begged you to throw out the fiarm coat
our fireshman year.
I mean, you lost both ofi us
a lot ofi dates with that thing on, okay?.
You've had it since, like, birth.
All right?. So do me a little fiavor.
Let's not pretend that the jackie
and the, uh, weight...
Ow!
and theJon Bon Jovi hair
are no big thing.
Ow! Don't!
'Cause when it comes to routine,
you used to be, like,
Mister goddamn Rogers.
It's a fiuckin' jacket, Phil!
Just lay ofifi.
Go to class.
Uh-huh, fiine.
Fine.
I just hope the next time
we pass each other,
I recognize who the hell you are.
Oh, yeah?. Well, ifi not, you and Evelyn
can always head over to Record City
and have a chat.
Hey! I wouldn't get too deep
into the moral issues during
this particular conversation.
Okay, Romeo?.
I may have a big fiucking mouth,
but at least I keep it to myselfi.
Oh! My--
Oh, is it time to go?
Uh-huh?
Fine. So long, matey!
Ow!
You've got my fiuckin' bag!
Dude!
Seriously, I've got class!
**
**
**
* Oh *
**
So, everything's good?.
Yeah. You know, okay.
Hmm.
You?.
Oh, pretty great, actually.
J ust studying, working on my art.
Right. You've got that
big thing thatyou're doing.
Mm.
Thesis project fior my degree.
And it's going well?.
Yeah.
What was it again?.
I never said.
Oh. Well, that's why.
Right. It's this sculpture...
thingie.
Nice.
I thinkwhatyou've
donewith Adam--
it's really great.
What I've done?.
Well,just, you know,
he's changed.
That's right. He's changed.
Ofi course.
I didn't mean thatyou--
I know. I'm just saying,
he did the work.
Right.
Well, that's always what
they say, though, isn't it?.
What?.
Who are "they"?.
You know, like in Cosmo,
when they have those tests
asking you what you'd like
to change about your guy.
Ah, now you're gonna get
all scientifiic on me.
It's true, though, isn't it?.
I mean, almost everyone
I've ever gone out with,
ifiyou could alterjust
one thing about them or...
even to get them to stop
wearing sunglasses
up on their head all the time,
then they'd be perfiect.
- Well, it's that sort ofi deal, isn't it?.
- Something like that.
Or it could just be
that I care about him.
Hmm. Well, Phil's got, like,
six ofithose "one things,"
but it's the same idea.
Right. Andhowis oldPhil?
Well, he's Phil--
six things away
firom being amazing.
Hey.
- Hey, Evelyn.
- Adam. Hi.
Jenny. I didn't know that you--
I invited her.
Oh.
Uh--
I like your new jacket.
Phil told me about it.
Oh,yeah. It's, uh,
new.
And your nose--
My God, are you okay?.
Ofi course.
It was nothin'.
Falling down
is not nothing.
It looks okay though.
- Anyway, uh--
- Anyway, pull up some floor.
We... got you a juice.
You don't drink cofifiee.
It's not. It's decafi.
It's still cofifiee.
Good point.
So I drink cofifiee.
Then I just don't
like the cafifieine.
Mm.Jennywas just saying
that she thinks you're great.
I mean, doing great things
with yourselfi.
Yeah?.
Thanks,Jenny.
She thinks you'rejust
about perfiect now.
Don'tyou,Jenn?.
I didn't say that.
No. It's true. I'm exaggerating.
She said-- and I paraphrase--
"He's changed,"
but she implied fior the better.
Oh. Well, I agree.
I have.
And again, thankyou.
You're welcome.
I thinkyou've changed too, Adam.
A lot.
Yeah?. How's that?.
Well, you've gotten cuter...
and stronger, more confiident
and, um...
crafitier.
Crafitier, huh?.
Apparently so.
Oh, that spill you took
must have done it.
I'm sorry. Am I missing
something here?.
I'm not sure.
Evelyn, what's up?.
Nothing. Not a thing.
Well, sometimes it's hard to read me,
you know, know when I'm joking.
Very hard.
It is, but I am...joking.
I mean, Adam took a bad fiall
and smashed his nose,
but he's okay now.
See?. It healed well,
don'tyou think?.
Yes.
Uh, doyou guys want
a salad or something?.
I'm hungry.
I'm fiine.Jenny?.
I'm okay.
Hungry?.
Your nose looks--
How much weight haveyou lost?.
Not that much really.
Twenty-one pounds.
Ipeeked. Is that all right?
- "Peeked"?.
- His journal-- a record ofi
his progress that he's keeping.
Really? Oh, that's so cool.
- Cosmo story in the making, huh?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'm, like, totallylost here.
You're mentioned in there too,
Jenny.
Where?.
Adam'sjournal.
I mean, it's a veiled entry,
but I think it's you.
Evelyn.
I peeked twice.
You're right next to someone
known as "cute waitress."
Whyis that?
- I mean, Adam?.
- You're not.
- Something about a meeting and
a drive afiter in your cute little "V-dub."
- What areyou saying?.
- It's getting pretty late.
I really need to get go--
- Don't go. Why areyou doing this?.
I just want to talk
about the kiss.
Whycan't we do that?
This is inappropriate, okay?.
Did you tell her?.
No. No, no. He didn't.
Philip did. We met,
and he told me all about it.
The rest I got
from loverboy's diary.
She's making that up.
Wait. Philip told you
about our talk?. When?.
What else
did he tell you?.
Lots ofithings.
He's a very chatty guy
when you... wind him up.
I can't believe it.
Evelyn, let's just drop it, okay?.
- Ifiyou're angrywith me,
all right, but this is not--
- We're just talking.
Fine. You wanna--
Go ahead.
- I mean, Adam wrote something
in hisjournal, obviously.
- I didn't!
What do you wanna hear?.
We kissed.
No. No, no. I-- I knew that.
I'm sorry.
I've confiused you.
I meant about my kiss...
with Philip.
What?.
That's bullshit.
No. That's getting even.
Unless you guys have something else
you want to tell me about--
meaning the drive.
You didn't meet Phil.
Ask him.
- He would have told me.
- Apparently not.
I'm going.
I'm going now, okay?.
I'll, uh, seeyou.
You guys are still coming
to my showing, right?.
Well... you said you would.
Okay.
That was horrible.
Oh, I don't know.
I could've told her about
the blow job I gave him.
Kidding.
- You had no right
to make her fieel that way.
- She's got a boyfiriend who's shit.
- Now she knows.
- It was still wrong
to treat her like that.
- And me.
- Yeah, let's talk aboutyou.
She called me, okay?.
She wanted to get together and,
you know, talk about Phil,
and then--
And then you made out.
Most natural thing in the world.
It was a mistake, okay?.
I know that.
I just want the truth.
I told you what I did.
You think I wanted to kiss that guy?.
I only did it fior the efifiect.
I'm askingyou, Adam.
What else happened?
I deserve to know.
Nothing.
You're sticking with that?.
Oh, and glad to hear
aboutyour trip.
- See you next fiall.
- What was I supposed to tell him?.
- The truth!
- Wh--
Come on.
Look, I took shit
about my new jacket.
That's all people say to me anymore.
"What's up with you??"
"What's goin' on??"
I can't exactly spread it around
what I've done.
What?. You fiell.
What are we doing here?.
Areyou tired ofi me?.
Is that it?.
God, no!
I don't get it.
I don't want to sound
old-fiashioned here, but...
you're a step away firom
fiuckin' around on me.
I would never do that.
Ifiit hadn't been her,
ifi it'd have been...
oh, say, that cute waitress
the other night.
You didn't think
I caught that, didyou?
The chatty chat and the extra
three bucks on the tip.
That was nothing.
It's never anything...
until it's something.
Geez! Next you're gonna tell me
that the handkerchiefiwith
the strawberries on it is missing.
I don't know that refierence.
Evelyn, please.
Evelyn.
I'll do anything you want.
I know what I did was wrong.
I do. I messed up.
Sojust tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.
I just-- I don't--
I don't wanna lose you.
- You're sure?.
- I am so sure.
I love you.
Anything I say?.
Anything.
Give them up... as firiends,
both ofithem.
Huh?.
No explanation.
Don'tsee them orspeak
to them again, not ever.
That's what I want.
That's to prove to me
about how you fieel.
- And ifi I don't?.
- Well, um, I pretty much
let these things end.
Final answer?.
I choose you.
You choose well...
Grasshopper.
Adam.
- Ahoy.
- Phil.
How's it goin'?.
So...
what, you don't
take my calls now?.
What? No, I--
It's all right. I understand.
The whole...
thing.
-
- I've just been busywith work and all.
Yeah, whatever.
- Well, I should probably grab a seat.
- Hold up. Hey.
Where's the fire?
What?. No. I--
No. I just want a... good spot and--
So, where'sJenny?
Funny.
What?.
Man, come on.
We broke up, broke it ofifi-- whatever.
You knew that.
No. I-- When?
Like, two weeks ago,
right afiter--
You know.
You and Jenny--
I can't believe that.
Believe it. She came over one day
afiter seeing you guys, I guess.
That was it-- the ring ofifi,
took her CD's back--
gone.
I'm sorry.
I mean, I was lookin'to get out.
You know that. But once you start
makin' those plans, you know--
Iike pickin' out napkins and shit--
it's almost easier
to just do the thing.
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't worry about it.
You haven't seen her lately,
haveyou?.
- No.
- Okay.
Well, this ought to be good, huh?.
-
Jenny.
- Adam.
- Hey.
- Hi, Phil.
I'm sorry... about you guys.
Boy, you just can't keep
anything to yourselfi, can you?.
Well, everyso often,
I guess. Right?
What?.
You never change.
That's what.
- Oh, and, Phil?.
- Yeah?.
You don't really need

- What is she--
- It's not, like, totally ofifiicial yet.
Fuck. What areyou gonna do?.
- Well, we should probably
fiind a place too.
- Let's grab two close to the exit.
Oh, maybe we shouldn't--
You know,Jenny and--
Whatever.
Take care, man.
Could I--
Mm-hmm.
Good afiternoon.
Thankyou
fior coming out today.
It's the middle ofi Stop Week,
and I'm sure this is not...
how most ofiyou studying fior fiinals...
would choose to spend your time
away firom campus-- on campus.
The accompanying visual portion
ofithis graduate thesis project...
is currently available in
the exhibition gallery across the way,
so ifiyou don't stay today fior...
punch and cookies, um...
please stop by and take a look
atyour... convenience.
Okay, that's the boring stufifi.
Oh, I almost forgot.
And this is fairlypersonal--
probablyshouldn't even do it--
but it really is the capper
to my time here at Mercy,
so please indulge me.
I was given an engagement ring...
two days ago,
and I haven't really
answered the guyyet.
So I wanted to do it today.
Here goes.
This is a beautifiul stone...
and an amazing gesture
on your part...
fior many reasons.
By the time I'm through here,
I promise that you'll
haveyour answer.
Mygraduate advisorgave me
this advice five months ago.
"Strive to make art,
but change the world."
And so,
being a good little student,
that's what I set out to do.
With that in mind,
I present you with my newest work.
It is a human sculpture...
on which I've worked
these past 1 8 weeks...
andofwhom I am veryproud.
The piece itselfis untitled,
since I think-- I-I hope--
it will mean something dififierent
to each ofiyou...
and, firankly,
anyone who sees it.
Can I get a spot--
I did the MTV thing
here on the fiace.
This is a "befiore" picture that
I had a classmate take ofi us...
nearthe Pizza Hut
out bythe highway.
That was ourfirst
official encounter...
after he asked me out
at his place ofwork--
a big no-no,
or so I was told.
And it was here that I coaxed hi m
i nto eating his fiirst vegetarian meal.
Well, as vegetarian...
as a spinach-and-mushroom
calzone can be.
He also had a salad.
Anyway, he told me that,
fior him, it was a huge deal...
and it does mark the beginning
ofimy systematic makeover--
or sculpting, ifiyou will--
ofi my two very pliable
materials ofi choice--
the human flesh...
and the human will.
But this, I'm afraid, was not done
out oflove or caring...
or concern.
This was a simple matter of,
"Can I i nsti I l 'X' amount ofi change
in this creature...
using only manipulation
as my palette knifie??"
I made sure that nothing
was ever fiorced...
during our sessions
or sittings together--
I-I can't really say theywere
dates, not on my part,
although the illusion ofi dating
was imperative--
and that his firee will was at
the fiorefiront ofi each decision.
I made suggestions,
presented the illusion
ofiinterest and...
desire,
but never said,
"You must do this."
Not once.
Anyquestionsyet?
I found that with the right coaxing--
yes, coaxing,
often ofa sexual nature and often
in verypublic arenas, I'll admit--
I could hone the i nside
ofi my scul pture...
as well as the surfiace.
Now, I fiound myselfi...
suddenly creating
strong moral ambiguity...
where I could detect only
the slightest traces befiore,
ofiten in direct proportion
to the amount ofi external change.
This means, as my subject
became handsomer...
and fiirmer
and more confiident,
his actions became
more and more...
um...
questionable.
Against medical advice,
he had work done to his fiace...
andinsisted to those aroundhim
that he had...
What?.
merelyfallen down.
He also started to deceive
his friends-- and myself--
with greater abandon
during this period...
while showing increased interest
in other women.
I ndeed, he had relations
with his best firiend's fiiancée...
and continues to withhold details
about the incident firom us...
to this day.
Moreover,
he was willing to give those friends up
when asked--
walk away without
any fiurther contact...
afiter said encounter--
Ieading me to an assumption
ofi fiurther wrongdoing...
with the young woman in question.
This is fiucked!
I call this act
morally questionable...
because it seems to be motivated,
in my mind at least,
as much out ofi guilt
as genuine fieelings fior me.
He has then, as I see it,
been completely...
andtotallyrefashioned
as a person.
Andyet,
open anyfashion magazine,
turn on any television program,
and the world will tell you
he's only gotten...
more interesting,
more desirable, more normal.
In a word,
better.
He is a living,
breathing example...
ofi our obsession
with the surfiace ofithings,
the shape ofithem.
Not bad, huh?.
This was a completely...
startling and...
unexpected turn ofi events, but...
obviously, I can't accept.
You can examine the stone
andsetting further...
when it's placed
in the exhibit.
As for me,
I have no regrets,
no fieelings ofi remorse
fior my actions,
the manufiactured emotions--
none ofi it.
I have always stood by
the single andsimple conceit...
that I am an artist, onlythat.
There is... only art.
Now, you may hold
a dififierent opinion,
fieel dififierently.
I welcome that.
Dififierence is good,
great, vital even.
Only indififierence is suspect.
Only to indififierence do I say...
fiuckyou.
With that in mind,
I ofifieryou my untitled sculpture...
and supporting materials today.
Thankyou.
Not a big modern art crowd,
I guess, huh?.
Hey.
Glad you stopped by.
I can't really show my fiace
in the streets,
so it seemed logical.
Look, Adam, I know that--
Please...
just referto me as "it"..
or, uh, "untitled."
It'll help me keep
some perspective here.
I know that this a lot foryou
to take in and everything, but I--
Uh-huh, yeah.
I got a I ittle Gregor Samsa thing
goin' right now, so, uh--
I know my work relied on not
telling you what was going on.
Sorry.
You're sorry.
That's great. I fiigured
I was really gonna have to work
to get that one out ofiyou.
Oh, I'm notsorry,
not forwhat I've done.
I just fieel bad
that you're so upset.
Screw you!
You have screwed me, a lot.
You wanna watch it?.
J ust pull up a chair.
Shit. You are seriously
fucked up.
I mean it.
Listen toyourmouth, Adam.
You never used to talk like that.
Oh, you're gonna take credit
fior that too, huh?.
No.
You picked that up all on your own.
Cute guys always have potty mouths.
They think it makes them cuter.
Oh, yeah?
Tell me how cute
this one is then.
Fuckyou!
You heartless cunt.
So tell me then.
Go ahead.
You fieel that way about me.
You can tell me what I did wrong.
Ifl did something wrong.
You don't see this as wrong?.
You honestly have
no concept here.
Ifiyou hadn't
been here today,
hadn't heard all this stufifi,
wouldn'tyou still be happy--
waiting at home forme,
hoping this went well,
wanting to make love?
- That's not the point.
- Yes, it is. It's the total point.
All that stufifiwe did was real fioryou.
Therefiore, it was real.
It wasn't fior me.
Therefiore, it wasn't.
It's all subjective, Adam--
everything.
I'll tellyousomething real.
Ishouldsueyourass.
You could try.
I did take that risk.
Yeah.
That's right, you did.
What's this doin' here?.
It was only fiour bucks
at the Goodwill.
Whywould you buy that?.
Just so I'd have it--
all ofiyou.
Fine.
What the hell?.
It can't get anyworse.
Ifiyou get ofifi on showing people
my old socks...
and scuzzy sheets, go fior it.
I don't "get ofif" on it.
This is mywork, Adam.
I'll give you backwhateveryou want
as soon as I get my grade.
The ring would be nice.
It was my grandma's.
I'll take care ofiit.
Good.
Hard fieelings?.
Me?
No. We had some fiun, right?.
- Yeah.
- Oh, but, hey, that's subjective.
Exactly.
But do me a favor?
Don't fiool yourselfi
and think that this is art. Okay?.
It's a sick fiuckin' joke,
but it's not art.
Is that right?.
Prettymuch,yeah.
And ifI'm wrong about that--
I mean, ifi I've completely
missed the point here,
and somehow puking up...
all your own shitty little neuroses
all over people's laps is actually art,
then you ought to at least realize
there's a price to it all.
Wow. Okay, so...
you're saying...
I should be a better person?.
I mean, is that it?.
That's the nutshell, yeah.
Betterlike...you?
No.
Just better.
Oh.
Tell me, though,
just one thing.
Yes?.
Was any ofi it true?.
The, uh, nosejob...
or Lake Forest?.
Your mother's maiden name?.
One thing you ever said to me?.
No.
And the scars are--
That was another project.
I got it.
Sorry.
I should, uh,
probablyget going.
Areyou coming?
No, not yet. Don't worry.
I'm not gonna mess up your stufifi.
No spray paint.
That one time...
in mybed one night
whenyou leaned over...
and whispered in my ear--
remember?.
-And I whispered back to you.
I said that I--
- I remember.
I meant that.
I did.
- Yeah?.
- Yes.
Oh.
