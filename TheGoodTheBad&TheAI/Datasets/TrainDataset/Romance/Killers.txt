ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME?
IF I WANTED TO DO THIS

SOUNDS WEIRD ...
LOGICALLY, YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE.
YEAH, RIGHT.
- SPREAD YOUR LEGS.
- HOW MANY THINGS DO YOU HAVE ON HERE?
HOW MANY PEOPLE, SPENCER?
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
OR IS THAT WHEN YOU GUYS
WRITE THE BOOK WITH MANY WOMEN
YOU HAD SEX AND MULTIPLY BY 10?
I HAVE NOT DONE SO.
THEY WERE BAD GUYS,
FAR AS I KNOW.
IT WAS HARD TO TELL
THEN I MET YOU,
I LOVE AND I GAVE UP.
YESTERDAY I WAS CONTACTED BY A GUY.
GO TO A HOTEL.
YOU DISCOVER WHAT HAPPENED.
HONEY, YOU CAN SEE THE GUN.
WHERE DO THEY KEEP HER?
YOU SEE WHAT SIZE IS THIS?
S FATHER, TO RESPOND?
I THOUGHT YOU CHANGED IT.
RELAX, DEAR.
IT'S PRETTY EARLY TO CHECK IT
BY SPENCER, DO NOT YOU THINK?
AND JEN IS JUST PLACES A HOTEL.
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.
SPENCER, I FOUND THIS.
EASY, IS MY FORMER BOSS.
ONE HEART AND ONE HEAD.

MUST HAVE LEFT A TRACE,
WITHOUT NOTICE.

- MISSING A PART OF IT.
- RIGHT.
OKAY, LET'S GO.

- THE CONTRACT WAS MADE THIS MORNING.
IT WAS ANOTHER KILLER IN THE HOUSE.
I THINK WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- GO HOME TO MY PARENTS.
YES.
DAD KNOWS WHAT TO DO.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
I DO NOT WANT TO INVOLVE YOUR PARENTS.
I NEED THE HELP OF YOUR FATHER.
I THINK YES.
BECAUSE YOUR PLANS
FAILS.
I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO INVOLVE YOUR PARENTS IN IT.
ARE YOU A SPY AND DOUBLE AGENT
AND I'M BAD NOW, BECAUSE
I INVOLVE PARENTS, REALLY?
WE WERE MARRIED FOR THREE YEARS, AND NEVER
I HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM YOUR PARENTS.
ARE ALWAYS AT HOME
AND YOUR FATHER ALWAYS TELLS US
WHY AND HOW TO DO IT.
MUST BUY
THE DISHWASHER,
OR GRASS CUTTING IT THAT WAY.
STOP, TALK
ABOUT MY PARENTS.
I'M YOUR HUSBAND.
WHAT WE DO
WHEN TO HAVE CHILDREN?
TALK TO ME.
WITHDRAW WHAT I SAID,
I LIKE YOUR PARENTS.

TO PROTECT YOU.
IT'S A BIT LATE FOR PROTECTION.

THROUGH EVERY PORE,
I FEEL ALL SORTS OF SMELLS,
AND I FEEL LIKE VOMIT
EVERY BREATH.

- MY KNEES ...
THEY ARE ALWAYS SO?
TAKE THE PILL EVERY DAY.
I KNOW, BUT I MADE A BREAK
LAST WEEK, REMEMBER?
SINCE I TOLD YOU THAT MAKE A BREAK
WITH THE REST OF THE PILLS

DO NOT YELL AT ME.
IT WAS YOU WHO SUGGESTED
S DO SATURDAY.
CAN WE HELP YOU?

IT'S A BABY IN ME.
DO NOT MAKE ME MAD.
YOU ARE NOT CRAZY
SCENARIO THIS IS CRAZY.

CAN I HELP YOU?
YES, YES, YOU ...

ANSWER YOUR PHONE, SIR.
MY BEST FRIEND IS DEAD
AND YOU CAN SAY THAT TARGET IS ALIVE.
PUT THE GUN DOWN, SPENCER.
HEY, GUYS ...
HE KILLED MY BOSS.
A BLOW TO THE HEAD, REMEMBER?
AND THEN TRIED TO KILL ME.
DADDY, IS THIS TRUE?
I MIXED IN YOUR LIFE
BECAUSE I TRUSTED
IN YOUR HUSBAND.
I HOPED TO USE IT AGAIN.
IT'S NO PIECE OF THE CLOCK.
EVERYTHING IS THERE.
ALL THE DIRTY WORK,
AND IN THE OFFICE WHEN I SAW
POSTCARD WITH NAME WRITTEN ON IT,
I KNEW YOU BACK IN GAME
AND THAT WILL COME AFTER ME.
SO I ENABLED CRIMINALS.
DO NOT TRY TO KILL YOU, SIR.
WHY NOT TELL ABOUT NICE
WHEN YOU TRIED TO GET MY BRAINS?
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT NICE?
SUPPOSED TO BE IN THAT HELICOPTER.
BUT I SAW THAT YOU DROPPED.
YOU SAID YOU WAIVED

AND YOU FATHER?
FOR GOD'S SAKE, DAD.
OKAY.
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT FOR
A "CIRCLE OF TRUST."

COME ALL HERE.
MOM, COME JOIN US.
I DO NOT DO SUCH THINGS.
I KNOW, MOM, BUT I

FINALLY, I UNDERSTAND THAT SHOULD NOT
I BLAME
FOR MISTAKES MADE, RIGHT?
YOU, YES, AND YOU MUST UNDERSTAND,
AND I NEED TO BE AWARE
THAT I MARRIED A MAN ...
WHICH IS EXACTLY LIKE MY FATHER ...
A LIAR.
IF ANY OF YOU
WANTS TO SEE THIS CHILD ...
THAT IS WHAT THEY DO.
THERE WILL BE LIES.
WILL NOT BE STEALING CARS,
OR WEAPONS HIDDEN IN FURNITURE.
I WILL NOT TRY ANYMORE BECAUSE
YOU KILL EACH OTHER.
IN FACT, THERE WILL BE ASSASSINATIONS.
I SEE THAT I DO NOT WANT TO KILL
EVEN A BITE, RIGHT?
WE ARE TOGETHER?
- YES.
- YES?
GOOD JOB, DEAR.
ELSE SHOULD KNOW?
ANYONE?
ENGLISH IS NOT MY NATIVE LANGUAGE.
AND ALSO ...
THE THIRD WEEK
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER
YOU SAID:
"I LOVE YOU" DURING SLEEP.
AND I SAID NO, BECAUSE
WANTED ME TO BE THE FIRST TO SAY IT.
THANKS, HONEY.
MOM?
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE SMALL
AND I WENT FOR A WALK?
- NO.
- NO? FORGET IT.
IN ADDITION TO TRACK KILLERS AND WORK
A GOVERNMENT AGENCY ...
I'D LIKE TO ADMIT ...
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT HOLE
ON OUR PROPERTY.
HI, JEN.
HONEY?
I DO NOT THINK IT IS A KILLER.

PLEASE TELL HIM THAT IT EMULATE.
SORRY, DEAR,
ALL GIRLS LOVE THEIR FATHER.
THIS IS DISGUSTING.
WE HOPE THAT ALL PARENTS
ARE BEAUTIFUL.
THAT'S SOMETHING PSYCHOLOGICAL.
THINK AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IT IS.
ARE YOU HERE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM
PARENT, AND IT TRAUMATIZED.
I DO NOT WANT TO SCARE HIM.
