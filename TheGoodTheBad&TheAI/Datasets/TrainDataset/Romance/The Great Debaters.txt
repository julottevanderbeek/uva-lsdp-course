Make your work
And allow to do it
For the good of all.
Amen
When all this ends,
Be a little better.

What?
Something to you
As a boy, he spoke as a boy.
Entendia as boy
I thought as a boy
But when I became a man,

Things for boys.

Lucky in America.
Because we have the
Work more importantly,
... Of America.

Education is the only way out.

Who wrote that?
Martin Hughes, 1924.
You hate to be a game
What is done with hands full
The memory will put in their hands
... On your chest
And you entederás my hate.
Gwendolin Bennet wrote that.
She was born in 1902
Outside the records
Summer in most states
The blacks are denied
The certificate of birth
From what I can deny my
Age for the rest of my life.
Believe that I am funny?
Born without registration.
Mr. Reed, distribute it.
I shall to you the news

As Hughes, Bennett,
... Zora Neale Hurston, Collin County.
Me food with a spoon,
Silver with the stars and sky.
Corto my teeth as
A black guaxinim
The implements of war
Me find after class.
What makes a teacher
In the middle of the night,
... Dressed as a peasant?
What does a student in the middle of the
Night looking to lose their lives?
What strange, I thought
I was defending me.
I remember
Some years ago
When disappeared.
What was?
And I will come when I will.
Te suspended?
-- Asked license.
Why again?
At school is the only place
Where you can read all day.
Except the prison.
I want my will
Home tonight at 7:30.
It is at the corner of Junhos and Campos
Why would it?
We are recruiting for
A team of debate.
Are you sure you want someone like me?
No, why will the evidence.
At 7:30, and Junhos Campos.
Levado by the wind and rain.
He and the Junior today.
Of the 360 students here
At the University of Wiley.
Only 45 of these were
Brave to come,
... The evidence of the team of debate.
Of the 45 only 4 left here
When the tests end.
Why? Because the debate
Is a esprte of war.
It is a fight, but his weapons are words.
Enter ... Now that you
Farmer came can begin.
Do you feel Mr. Farmer ...
Not there, there.
-- Good evening sra. Tolson.
-- Good evening.
-- We hope you sir.
-- Will I have.
Thank you, smells good sr. Farmer.
-- Thank you.
-- From nothing.
Ladies and senhorita.
This is the place,
... Hot.
Entered running because wanted.
Mr Tolson, and the debates
Last year?
Do not ask what they already know.
Get up, will be the first,
Here in the hot zone.
The debate begins with a
Proposal, with an idea.
The boys must work in
If regular government.
The first debate
Speaks positively.
So will agree.
Mr Reed, speak
Positive, the second the negative.
-- What is bad?
-- What are against.
Brilliant sr. Burgess.
Falará positively
Sr. Reed, start.
Well, start with a
Quote the poet Claycoin.
The flowers born so close to the mill.
What almost all boys
That work can see.
-- Y, Y..
-- What was in that minute?
It was learned that
Last year sr Reed?
Start something and not finish, it was so?
-- No sir.
-- They are.
Who will be the next?
You, lift, lift.
If it is late, as
More if you hide?
I am not hiding me sir.
Me transferring from my university
To come to the evidence.
I am very excited, as if called?
-- Samantha Booke.
-- Booke?
-- A "and" at the end.
-- From Miss Booke footing with "and".
Among the hot zone
Miss Bookde with an "e".
You know that there has never been a woman
The team of debate, never?
Yes, I know you.
What makes you think
You could be the first?
-- Because I am as smart as ...
-- Not speak it.
-... Any other person.
-- The theme senhorita.
Social assistance
Desestimula the hard work.
-- Do you speak negatively.
-- Well
Assistance strip of man
A stronger reason to work.
What is survival.
And it weakens the will of
Poor, as refutaria that?
I would say not.
Most of this goes to the
Children and the disabled.
-... And people bigger.
-- That is a conjecture or a fact?
-- It is a fact.
-- Highest.
-- It is a fact.
-- What is your source?
-- The Chairman.
-- Of the United States?
Yes, sir.
That is their main source?
.... Spoke with the president
Roosevelt in person?
Of course not speak with him personally.
But the ever hear.
-- In a radio transmission?
-- Yes
Some other source? Some other?
Yes, there are other sources,
... Look like the eyes of a mother
That can not feed their children.
Without the assistance sr. Tolson,
Morreriam people from hunger.
-- Who would die of hunger?
-- The unemployed.
The sr. Burgess is unemployed
And as you can see not died of starvation.
I have a shot of you senhorita Booke.
Me deêm real facts to
I syllogism not fall.
-- Silogismo?
-- His logic that speaks.
Principal premise,
Desemprecados die of hunger.
Minor premise,
The sr. Burgess is unemployed.
Conclusion, sr. Burgess
Is dying of hunger.
Its main premise was
Based on a mistaken belief.
Falácia classic.
Who is next?
Esteve well.
-- Say you.
-- Henryu Lowe with a "u".
Okay, sir. Lowe, I shall the matter,
You speak it.
Is there any citation of the literature.
Ahead.
Beauty.
I heard the Lord say
That all beauty is passing,
... As the water.
Very good, history.
And the author's name this time.
The story is a pesadêlo
I want to wake up.
James Joyce.
Pena itself.
Never saw things wild
Feel sorry for themselves
D. H. Lawrence.
Me encanta D. H.
Lawrence, already read?
-- Mr. Farmer.
-- Yes, sir.
I have eyes on the neck and
Heard on all sides.
Get up.
Tell me the irony in the name.
Bethlehem Steel Corporation
Bethlehem is where
Jesus was born, after the peace.
And Bethlehem however does
Pra war weapons.
Well, sit down.
Who next?
Samantha.
The sr. Tolson is very tough, no?
I am sure it is.
My name is James.
Your father is Dr. James Farmer?
Yes, it does.
I hear the most and that
Man as speaking languages.
French, Greek, Hebrew,
Latin, who speak languages?
-- Some languages.
-- Only a few.
Must be the man most
Intelligent Texas.
Not so, it is exaggeration.
So you want to be on the team?
It would be a good entertainment.
-- What?
-- Be lawyer.
Lawyer? It is genial.
You know how many women are
Lawyers in the United States?
-- Two.
-- Exactly.
One is beautiful.
Look sr. Farmer, which his age?
I am 16.
In 21 months.
Miss, James, only
I wanted to thank.
-- Why?
-- By their actions today.
How many other students
Tolson faced?
-- I did not.
-- No, you answered a question.
And I just said a few citations.
But the senhorita Brooke with an "e".
-- She fought.
-- And lost.
But it has to lose by
It is not their legitimate source?
Because Tolson said.
Nobody has better access to
Statistics that the President.
If I had said that
The Tolson, would have gained.
I do not know with certainty
Something would have happened.
Good evening James.
You can believe that has 14
Years and is the university?
They are privileged, everyone.
Once you should know that chose
This team for the balance.
... And nobody should
Taken as a failure.
As denigrição of his intellect.
Denigrição, you get another word.
From Latin niger, deny,
Black is always present.
There is in the dictionary, there is no
Speech of a black teacher.
Somehow the black
Always been associated with the failure.
Write your own dictionary and
Marquem as a new beginning.

A fight of words.
There has to deceive yourself.
Use your mood against your opponent.

Take the black evil and more restless.
Take the clothes ...
In front of other blacks,
... Women, men and children.
Pass Pitch and plumes,
Amarrem in each leg,
.... A horse going
In the opposite direction.
Prendam fire onto the horses,
... Until they leave the half.
Faced men,
Black women and children.
Give chicotadas coups and the
Black men who fall.
Almost to death but not kill.
But release the fury
Of God on them.
Because they can be
Useful for creating later.
Does anyone know who was
I said that?
Raise your hand, anyone?
It was a perverse owner of
Slaves in West, Virginia.
The foremen of
Colonies have problems,
... Controlling the slaves.
Once you bruscaram
Linch to indicate their methods.
The word linchar came from his nickname.
His methods were very
Simple but diabolical.
Matinham the slaves
Physically strong.
But weak psicológicamente
And dependent on the owner.
They remove the body and the mind.
I

Teachers in this university.
We are here to help you.

... Your mind.
Because obviously lost.
That is all you need
Learn from me Sr. Lowe.

Organized, summer.

No sir.

Sit, are one of the morning.
You would have sought where wanted.
Fuia the house of the Lord

Why I was there.

Once you give another
Opportunity, which was?

We were worried about you.

But it seems you well, right?
Yes sir, seems very well.
We will have some kind of white
North who come to our town.
They are bringing problems between
Men of color and whites.
They say that we
Make a union.
All workers,
Those of color and whites.
Needing a trade union?
Who believes that?
I do not know you, I do not know much of this.
Esas is a bad idea,
Believe it is an extremely bad.
Yes, sir.
They say that there was a meeting
Secretly near the lake.
Do you know anything about that?

Preview is the highest, so I thought
That we need a warming.
With the best black university in the USA?
That same sr. Burgess,
Is with fear?
Yes sir.
A week is not enough time
Write to the arguments.
You will
Research, I should write.
Wait, you, so you write?
And you tell the sr. Lowe.
What devils seem, a postman?
The devil will be
I ask again.
In theory seems a student.
So is saying
I am not capable?
There is no question of ability
But of experience.
-- How can you?
-- So I write.
Thus has always been,
Will be well.
Some other question?
One week.
Bring them to our first
Student yes.
The University of Callqueen.
Oquery Hobert.
The assistance of
Unemployed should acarba.
When the depression finish.
If it is going to end.
I have traveled in atrá
History until 1536.
When the first laws of
England were written.
In these days to assistance
As a call.
They were paid through
Voluntary donations.
But over time,
... The British divided
The systems of maintenance.
The first law of unemployment.
If paid with donations not voluntary.
More commonly known as taxes.
This system was a disaster.
Not enough to give
A man a job.
But to do so would
That give you an economic life.
Not levy taxes until they died.
When capitalism was young.
The concept puritano of duty was,
... That no one who works not comeria.
And this was happening when
More work than men.
But those days passed.
Now those who want to
Work are unemployed,
So they should not eat?
Because there is no work?
Today, we need
Another concept of duty.
The right of an individual
Of losing the sociedae,
... Both as a society.
Applaud to anything
That seems a solution.
The month for assistance.
Pagaria with it if it
Eliminated the vagabonds of the streets.
One seventh of the population of this
Live country's welfare.
Would be good with it
End the misery.
A nation so desperate with this,
... Is a danger to itself.
As a general Roman brought
Peace provinces rebels.
Killing for all its citizens.
Until his companions
Romans were in shock.
One described ...
What that create siginifica
Desolation and call it peace.
And with all the facts and data,
Of Callqueen also created desolation.
And call for peace.
They want that desempregadosmorram
So that the economy could live.
A bright young man
Us once asked,
... Argued that its position
On social assistance.
She named the most powerful source
The look in the eyes of a mother
When they can not feed their children.
They can look at the famine
In the eyes of a child?
See the blood on your feet by walking
Descalço in the fields of cotton?
Perguntarem her sister
With pain in the belly of hunger,
... It is with ethics
The work of his father?
He is good.
All that matters is that
The big fish and small,
... The color of the fish does not see.
GANHADOS 2. LOST 0.
We should do something every
Time a victim is black.
The federal government
Should not intervene?
GANHADOS 3. LOST 0.
And the winner is ...
The University of Wiley.
GANHADOS 9. LOST 0.
GANHADOS 18.

University in America,

A university white.
That's nice.
The University of Oklahoma.
Not the University of Oklahoma
But to the city of Oklahoma.
The debate will be in a
Camp in the north.
Because a camp?
Why should the times
Take things little by little.
You are not saying that
Can enter the university?
No, I say we should
Go slowly.
-- This is a great opportunity.
-- Thank you.
The opportunity to merge
Migalha one of your plate.

I believe that Lowe is afraid.
James Who?
I believe that is afraid of
Discuss with whites
-- Anglo-Saxons.
-- Anglo-Saxons.
-- Thank you.

I debaterei with
Anglo-Saxons wherever.
In a dark alley without light.
With a Candelabrum and people
In pursuing with weapons.
I debateria with
Anglo-Saxons wherever.
-- I am not afraid.
-- I do.
Mr. Tolson when I came here today.
I saw men of
Sherife watching your house.
What is hovendo?
Maybe you should
Ask sherife.
There are many rumours about what it does.
My father called the
Dean last week.
And asked if there was a
Communist at the University Methodist.
My policy is my problem and promise
That does not put at risk the team.
But if you are in danger.
I came to learn University
Not that I investigate.
-- Te understand.
-- I do not want drag.
Yes my father ...
Souber.
Mr. Tolson me just say
It is not communism is not ...
If not what?
If not what?
My father said that I should leave him.
-- Nobody wants that.
-- Me says.
As I said, my policy is my problem.
Then I leave it.
Mrs. Tolson, thanks for dinner.
De nada.
Good luck in Oklahoma.
I know that win.
If someone wants more
Let me, I entenderei.
The black ...
... Should be admitted.
We can hear you.
I say,
Black people should be admitted,
... At the state university.
My companion and I taste it,
... Blocking the admission of blacks,
... At the University of the State
Is not only wrong.
It is absurd.
People of color are not
Only the color on the cloth American.
They are the line that
Keeps everything together.
Considering the records
Legal and historical.
May 13, 1865,
Craker sergeant, a black.
It is the last soldier who
Died in the Civil War.
In 1918 the first
American soldiers,
Condecorados by ...
Prowess in France.
Are blacks Henry
Johnson and Nito Robins.
Announces that the "n" of black,
... Is to write capital
From there on.
Leaving the south for them, but where
Are not prepared for this.
It would cause nothing but racial hatred.
The doctor WE Devoid, perhaps
The most eminent black America.
He said,
... It is a loss
Silly of money.
Time and temperament,
... Deal with what the majority does,
... Which determined
That never would.
My opponent chose
Conveniently ignore,
... That W. E. Devoid is
The first black receberu a PhD,
... In a university
White, imagine.
The doctor said that it is impossible,
... Impossible for a black
Receive a proper education,
... In a white university.
Most black eminiente
University of America,
... Is the product of a
Education white.
Devoi knows well the resistance
The white man to change.
But that is no reason to keep any
The black out of any university.
If someone forçasse the south to something
For which is not prepared.
Then, however, be wrong
And srta. Booke would cook
Admit it is true.
Many white are infected
With the disease of racial hatred.
And the racism would be impossible
For a negro be happy,
... In a southern university today.
And if someone is unhappy,
... It is impossible to see how they can
Receive a proper education.
If, come the moment where
Blacks and whites are the same school.
And share the same classes.
But unfortunately that day is not today.
While the schools are segregated.
The black one rebeberão
Education which are both,
... Separate and unequal.
By thinking of Oklahoma.
The state is spending 5 times more,
... In the education of a child white.
What in the education of a black.
This means better
Books for that child.
I say that this is a lástima.
But my opponent said
That today is not that day,
... So that blacks and whites
Go the same university.
Share the same premises.
Walking in the same classes.
Could you tell me when
Is that that day will come?
On tomorrow?
On this week that
Come, in one hundred years,
... Never?
There is no time for justice. The time
For freedom and equality,
... Is always, always, always now!
Thank you.
What is this?
Te said it is wine,
Care with heart.
-- If said.
-- It's good.
Replace if needed.
And my arms were the words.
It would not have to do anything, anything, you will see ...
Me find out in 5 minutes.
Okay.
Nobody knows that better than you.
-- How is Pearl?
-- Pearl?
What vom see you, and your husband?
You are in the studio.
-- Dr. Farmer.
-- Congratulations Melvin.
-- Thanks.
-- In put on the map.
Your child has done a great job,
His research is impeccable.
This is good, good.
There are people of the city that are not
Happy with their other activities.
The call radical.
I surpeenderia
That one day discovered,
... And I said that
You hung in a tree.
Would that get me before.
Melvim This is serious, very serious.
A hungry black steals
A chicken and will get prison.
A rich merchant, steals the
Farm and goes to the congress.
I believe that this is wrong.
If that makes me radical, a
Socialist, a communist ...
-- Jesus was radical.
-- Be careful.
-- Yes, it was, it was radical.
-- Careful, careful.
Many institutions are in flood
People who badly interpreted Jesus.
Now it is compared with Jesus Christ?
If compares with Jesus? You know
What the words are.
-- Come on.
-- Amen
I do not want me confused.
I am not confusing, I believe.
Do not you think.
Only worries me their methods.
What methods?
James was there tonight, huh?
It was not me.
-- Is the surrounding it?
-- Of course not.
I will do everything possible
Make it out of this.
Deixá it? He wants to be that?
Me says it wants?
No, not whether, perhaps
Should discuss this with him.
I am speaking with you and
I do not believe that is honeto.
I am being honest ...
I think that was there with him tonight.
-- He was not me.
-- He is a boy of 14 years.
I understand.
And I will do whatever it takes to
Protect you, understand?
Someone has headquarters?
-- Thanks.
-- From nothing.
-- This is a beautiful party.
-- Thank you.
I think it is time to cut the cake.
-- Please.
-- Te ajudarei.
It is not time to talk about it.
-- Congratulations.
-- Thanks.
This is so beautiful.
Yes, I was born here, near the lake.
I come here since he was a boy.
His parents live here?
No, they already were.
My grandparents created me.
And my grandfather spent their lives building
All this, of course bounty.
He was a slave?
My grandmother always me
Said that if we do not include well.
The Confederates would
And I would take.
What?
Never had seen his side before.
What next?
It seems so calm, peace.
This happens, I am happy here.
It's funny.
Part of me wants
Stay in the lake.
Reading books all day,
Fishing when you have hunger.
And the other part wants to go
To all places and see everything.
Want to go to New Orleans,
In New York, Chicago,
... San Francisco.
Take the road.
And disappear.
Maybe I can take you.
-- Stir Up
-- Which was?
The band is outside.
What? By Allah. He said that
Anyone see today.
Usually nobody comes.
Wait, wait.
Vista itself

Samantha and return to university.
We will view themselves.
Go and tell Tolson, I

Let Lowe, knows that
We will grow ...
It seems that it will join later.
It will join later.
Are some things get done.
Good news, good
News, good news ...
My phone tapped until
No more power.
The University of Michigan wants
Discuss with us.
This goes to you, to Georgia,
Where is sr. Lowe?
Once again the debate?
Faster than imagined
James, much faster.

Maybe you tired of this.

From see other people debating.

There could do nothing without you.
I know you can do it without me.
Sorry.
-- James.
-- What?
James, wait.
It was very unpleasant what I said.
I do not want to lose your friendship ...
How can you lose
Something that has never?
It has never been my friend?
Perhaps not only want to be your friend.
Maybe I machuque be your friend.
-- Legend not translated --
Mr. Tolson.
Where is he?
-- Calma Lowe.

We left.
-- They did something to you?
-- No, we are fine.
Journal.
I am Dr. James Farmer.
This is William Taylor,
The lawyer sr. Tolson.
-- And this is his wife, Ruth
-- Hi
I would like to see my client, please.
William.
Journal Dozier, Dr. James Farmer,
This is William ...
William, as it is?
-- Well, sr. And you?
-- Not so bad, not so bad.
Look as time passes, knew
William when I was a boy
Can I see my client

His client?
The reality of the facts, it
That his client is busy.
Busy, doing what?
Journal, official.

Look, this is what happens to a
When people give a lot wing.
They get the problems.
The people want to turn away for nothing.
Many may quit
Machucados if this continues.
Journal, it is clear
That is not evidence,
To secure sr Tolson.
I suggest that we let it go.
You suggest? Who hell are you?
Some months,
There was a beating in a bar in the city.
It was a peaceful and dear
Of our citizens,
That was brutally attacked by a
Gangue of violent vigilant.
You have been witness, because there was.
If you allow cause
Sherife this anger,
It is you who is
Breaking the law. Not them.
You are threatening me?
No, sir.
I would not make it.
But I can not speak for
That people who are outside.
When the law is not
Just, not flame law.
What does that mean?
A mass of angry citizens.
Whites and blacks.
Brigando as in war.
That's what you want as
Sherife this county?
Leaving that Tolson go get home.
I believe that all these friends
That are out there ...
... Will also get home.
-- This application costs 25 US dollars.
-- What?
I believe that money should qu eme.
Building up sr. Farmer.
Oh God ...
The Universdidade the Methodist
South canceled.
The University of Georgia
Appear that will do the same.
Why?
Always has been the black.
They are speaking on censoring,
The council asked me that
Stop working with
Leaders, and in another way,
I say that this is not my fight.
So ...
... Things are evil ...
My academic career is at risk,
My team for debate is not pra go.
Someone knows who was Anteu?
Certainly, it was a giant
Of Greek mythology.
His mother was Gaia, which was the land.
It was invincible because the contact
With the land was stronger.
Correct, was stronger.
It had to defeat the
Which was strong.
You are my students,
I am your teacher.
I believe that this bond is sacred.
What will I do now?
Why the board said,
Because the sherife said?
Why do the guards
Texas said? No!
I am being coerced to do.
My message you get
Does not return.
We did not let us quit.
Good
What to do?
-- What discuss with Harvard.
-- Harvard?
The University of Harvard, they
Have the national champions.
If the derrotarmos,
Derrotaremos the best.
Sr.Tolson with respect.
Harvard do not want to compete with us.
We are a small University
From Marshall, Texas.
I know that we Henry.
I have read their letters,
Studied their monitors ...
How do we get there?
Only if contunarmos winning.
Dr. Farmer informed me,
That the Harvard University,
Will give a demonstration
Prior next week.
We have nothing to lose.
If elimanarmos Harvard ...
... We defeated the
University best in the country.
Assure them that this will not
Will be able to ignore that.
Correct?
Yes
-- Look good, does not see this?
-- Tried throughout corner.
-- Preview, Texas. It is the 1-27.
-- Me ensiana that meeting.
-- Not here.
-- Is yes, that is not found.
He saw the 2 and 7.
Sure, look it, is here.
After 1-26,
Before 1-28.
No way ... where
Gone this map?
What are doing?
I will fall.
Tour pro car, close the door.
Nobody moves.
Abaixem is abaixem up.
Download up too.
It has a black in that car.
Come on, let's pick it.
Ok, all seats
Quiet, I will ...
... Fetch the keys.
-- How is sra. Baker?
-- I am fine.
-- Okay?
-- Yes
-- Among please.
-- Thanks
Henry.
Henry.
Henry.
Hi baby, how are you?
I was waiting for?
What is the problem dear? Come on.
Samantha.
Shut your mouth and we will.
-- Which was?
-- Come on.
-- Where are we going?
-- We must talk.
Te thought sr. Tolson.
Ok, she feels ...
Come here ...
... Gives me a hug.
Stop.
It has no value ...
How?
Believes that you are the only one affected?
Ok, I feel very ...
... By all ...
... By drinking ...
... I am sorry.
I am not talking about me.
Ok
I will deal with it.
It will not, she does not have to see you so.
No, all is well,
Talk to her ...
Let me resolve
My things alone
Calma boy, stop.
Stop, I am not fighting you.
Easy.
You are crazy?
Never forget what
Seen, never forgotten.
These are the ones who can
Cut your fingers,
Your fingers, your nose, your ears.
Sometimes the parties have intimate.
Sometimes you degolam alive.
We never can forget that.
Believed that?
You will not do anything
James, does nothing.
In Texas, lincham the black.
It?
So no matter what the make?
What tá speaking ... what?
All this is useless.
What am I talking about?
We are only discussing topics blacks
With which we agree.
James, does not speak well.
-- Why not ...?
-- Why can not.
You do not.
Goodbye, God bless.
Where is Samantha?
It is not going to us.
Why not?
What do you think?
Take it to the road.
To come back to school.
I want this opportunity? This is your chance.
How can any black ...
... Defend the punishment of imprisonment ...
... When such exercises
Oppression in their own lives?
How?
Because the crime itself
Is a form of oppression.
And the blacks are the victims
Of violent crimes,
But that ninhuma another race in America.
For us.
... The arrest not only offers
Protection, but retribution.
Yes, it is so.
And for the criminals ...
... Is in reality a gift ...
... A shame that
Presents ...
... Which increases their
Passion for freedom ...
... Their hope for redemption.

I disagree, I do not believe that
People understand this, "saragarra" ...
"Sarcher graha" ... the sânscritos,
Siginifica truth and justice.
Te said.
It is clear to me that we must
Start the debate with Ghandi.
That is precisely what I will do.
Why start with the obvious?
Because that is what wins the debate.
Listen to what I said, this is Harvard.
The first should say that, it
Which means disobedience ...
Ghandi is a poet strong.
I want to win. You want to win?
Do I want to win.
This is the way we win.
He asked
Responsible. Not to you.
I am who makes the decision.
We will not start with Ghandi.
-- You are a marica.
-- You are an idiot.
Ah, I am an idiot?
When the two devil,
To hell with the debate.

You were ready.
You saw me the other
Instead, it was horrible.
Yes, it was terrible. T
Arrested aquel point. Right?
So. So I will quit,
So will render?
No.
Who is the judge?
What?
What is the judge?
The judge is God.
And why is He?
Why He decides who wins and
Loser, not my opponent.
Who is your opponent?
There is.
Why not?
Because it is only a distant voice
Face the truth that I speak.
Correct. Speak the truth.
Directly from Harvard, in the Classroom
Magna, in Cambridge Massuchusetts,
This is the WNBC Radio, bringing
Live the debate that will make history.
Among the small teams
University of Wiley, Texas,
And the team of
Harvard University.
For the first time a small team
Sees the champions of Harvard.
Who climbs on the stage now,
And the audience is silent.
On this special occasion,
We welcome as a separate
Universdidade team of Wiley.
Presenting the judges, the audience,
And through the radio, the nation.
The University of Harvard celebrates
Thanking the Franklin Eleanor Roosevelt,
But throughout University, no matter
How big is your history,
Can not allow live in your past,
Then the spirit of tomorrow,
The present today,
Debatedores the University of Wiley.
Samantha and Booke
Mr. James Farmer Junior.
Mr. Farmer discuss
The first yes.
Resolvo:
The civil disobedience is a weapon
Morality in the fight for justice.
But how can consider such a thing?
I think it depends on
Definition of the words.
Word.
In 1899 in India, 10
Thousand people gathered,
To protest
The laws of tyranny.
We started?
Your brother is talking, feel.
The Gal. Reginald Dyer,
The trancou a courtyard,
The soldiers for their
Confrontassem for 10 minutes.
Men, women, children,
Murdered in cold blood.
Dyer said that through
Give them a lesson.
And people do not
Responded with violence,
And yes with a campaign
Organised of non-cooperation.
The buildings of
Government were occupied,
The streets of people
Which is denied to move.
Still being beaten by the police.
Gandhi was arrested.
But the British were
Obliged to release him.
The called "a moral victory".
The definition of morality:
Assassination of Dyer,
Or the victory of Ghandi?
You decide.
- 1914 1918,
The world was at war with each minute.
Just think them.
Were sentenced every hour
Every day,
Of each night for long 4 years.
And here the fact immeasurable
Katerikoli another before the event.
Is there anything moral about this?
Nothing.
Except that Germany wanted
Enslave all of Europe.
The civil disobedience not
It is moral because it is not violent.
Fighting with violence to defend
Their country is the most profoundly moral.
Demandando large
Sacrifices of all.
The life itself.
The non-violence, is the mask
Pões so that the civil disobedience
To conceal its true face.
The anarchy.
Gandhi believed that should always act
With love and respect against his opponents.
So when are debatedores Harvard.
Gandhi also believed that
Those quebravam the law,
Would have to accept the consequences
Legal of their actions.
That sounds like Anarchy?
The social disobedience, not
It is something we should fear.
It is after all
American a concept.
Gandhi was not their inspiration
In the Indian scriptures,
But by Henry David Drough that
I was graduated in Harvard,
Guided by those who do not
Are very far from here.
My opponent is right in one aspect.
Drough was a graduate of Harvard,
And how many of us,
Bet that expanded their intellect.
He wanted to say:
"Any man more
Letrado that its neighbours,
Constiutui a majority of one. "
Words that Drought not calculated,
That Adolf Hitler studied
As them.
The beauty and value of
Democracy is this:
"No idea without prevalesce
The support of the majority ".
The people who decide the
Moral standards of his time,
Not a majority of one.
The majority did not decide
What is right or wrong.
But the conscience yes.
Because our citizens,
Entregariam their conscience
By the opinion of a majority.
We never, never in dobraríamos.
Forward the belief of any majority.
We can not choose which laws
Obey, or which ignore.
If we could never
Pararíamos in the red.
My father is one of the men
That are between us and chaos.
It is official police.
I remember a day that her partner,
His best friend,
Was overthrown in the fulfillment of the duty.
But vivid than the other, I
The expression on the face of my father.
Nothing ...
... That impedes the performance of
Law can be moral.
No matter where it dermos.
Why not say something?
In Texas ...
... Lincham the black.
My companions and I,
Saw a man hanging by the neck.
What had also been burned.
Fugimos the flock of linchadores.
Pressionamos our faces
Against the floor of the car.
I looked for my teammates.
I saw the fear in their eyes.
And worse, the shame.
What was the crime that black?
What should be placed without judgement,
In a forest dark and foggy.
He was a thief?
He was a murderer?
Or just a black?
It was a worker?
A preacher?
His children were waiting for him?
Who was next?
And did nothing.
No matter what was done,
Linchadores were criminals.
But the law did nothing,
So we are asking: Why?
My opponent said:
"Nothing that break the law
Can be moral. "
But do not be written law
Say that the black
Has no right to a home, that
Are rejected in schools,
In hospitals, nor
We are linchados.
St. Augustine said:
"An unjust law is not law."
What I have
Right, even the duty to resist.
With violence or civil disobedience ...
They should pray because
Chose the latter.
In the debate tonight,
Between Harvard University,
And the University of Wiley.
The winner is ....
The University of Wiley.
Only 7 years later in
Founded the Congress of Racial Equality.
And became a leader in the
Civil rights movement.
After a long life
To teach and write.
James Farmer father, died in 1961.
The day before

At the University of California.
