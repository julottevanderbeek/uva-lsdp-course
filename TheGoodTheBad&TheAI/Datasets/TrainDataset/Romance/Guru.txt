Gurukant Desai
salutes the family.
"Don't dream."
"Dreams never come true."
My father would say.
But I dreamt.
I'll work in Turkey
like Ghanshyam Das
Ghanshyam took him to town for
an interview - he got the job
I got my passport too.
Why's this happening behind my back?
The school results are
out tomorrow, right?
You checked the results in town?
You've failed?
Trying to cover
the shame with a job?
I've a job. How does a
pass or fail matter?
I'll skin you The whole
village will laugh that..
..the math teacher's son is
a fool. You'll never prosper.
Don't curse. He's going away.
Go to hell
I can't bear my son failing.
My step son is going abroad
Fall at my feet, you foolish monkey
Look step-mother I've
come from Idhar to Istanbul.
You run away too and come here
But you'll be scared when
you see these huge buildings.
I'm not scared. Know why? There's
no school, no father, nor his cane
I'm so glad to see you come.
I wear a uniform. Its Red. And
a cap too. I look good in it.
I work very hard.
I sell petrol cans.
You're amazing.
Come, this is not for us.
Your luck is incredible.
I'll open it...
You shut his shop. How did you know
the red ball was under that glass?
I just kept my eyes on that.
This is the spice business
Very big traders come here.
It's a business for the clever.
The sharper you are,
the luckier you are
From tomorrow there will be a new
trader amongst them - Gurukant Desai
Where's your tie? Take it out.
This?
- Wear it.
There have been sorme
complaints against you
You're lucky. He has
made you a sales supervisor.
It took me thirteen years to
become a sales supervisor.
...just keep that tie on.
I don't want to wear a tie
Nor do I want this promotion
Why?
I want to return to my village.
When did this foolish idea
occur to you, may I ask?
After wearing the tie.
Why?
You like my work, so
does he, then why should..
..I work for that white man?
I'll work for myself.
Take it in writing,
you'll never succeed.
My destiny is already written.
I'll always remember you
You're taking all the fun with you.
Now we'll just slog here.
Baapu, I'm leaving.
The country's become free
so why not your daughter?
I've found my partner
Please wish for my happiness
Sujata.
A bearded man left
this letter for you.
I don't have the courage to run
and lead a life with you.
Please forgive me, Sujata
Yours, Bhanu Patel.
You're spread like a
python on the whole berth.
I have a reservation.
Look out it's still night.
Can't think beyond the village
Throw it when the train
stops. It won't fly back
Oh god, I can't even cry in peace
Good, you woke me
My station's come
Girl Alone? Boarded
at the last Station?
Yes.
Where did you go and die,
all these days stepson?
I was saving myself from
your beatings, you witch
Guru has become an Englishman!
Come.
Sit. Sit.
Come Ramlal, look who's come
Guru? I didn 't recognize you
How would you?
- You can't see after your marriage
Has your wife come? Guru
give him some money...
Miser. Give him twenty.
Must have received ten
twenty lakh canings
And look at the
progress you've made!
If I'd known earlier, I would have hit
you until you became Prime Minister.
For me?
Wonderful!
How many days have you taken off?
As many as I want.
- What do you mean?
Meaning, I've left the job
But your brother said that they've promoted
you and tripled your salary.
Yes.. - but I've worked
enough for the white man...
I want to do business.
What do you know about business?
When I did business..
I could hardly put
food on the thable
Just because you failed,
doesn't mean I won't pass
Keep it. It'II help you
keep track of the bad time
Return his money.
Go do business.
Carrying huge tins, bhajiya in one
...Kachori in the other!
Bastard, you 've been selling
something or the other since childhood
Three paise profit for one bhajia
and the
bhajiya's weren't even hot
After climbing all
these stairs we should
at least make
half a paise profit
Bhajia!
Kachori!
King of misers!
I've fifteen thousand
I need another fifteen
He won't invest. He's saved
it for my sister's wedding
Dowry?
- Yes.
How much?
Twenty five thousand.
I'll marry her.
What?
Marry her to me.
She is elder to us by a year
One, two years is no big deal.
Don't talk without thinking.
Look, all I know is that
I'm ready to marry her.
Then we'll be business partners
Fifty-fifty.
You will receive a dowry
and make me an equal partner?
You'll also be part of the dowry
How do I tell bapu?
I won't be able to.
I'm marrying, not stealing
I'll talk to him
Have you come to talk about
marriage? Are you a broker?
We aren't interested.
The last time I saw you you
were crying yourself hoarse
I don't even know you. Why
would I cry in front of you?
You were crying in front of
the whole world on the train..
..reading some Bhapu Patel's letter
Who are you?
Guru, who knows everything.
My leg broke, it still hurts
Then go to a doctor
What are you here for?
Don't drag me into this
Where is Kaka?
Do you recognize me?
No.
You shut down my father's ghee shop
you even took away all the buffaloes
You're the boy who
hit me on my ear
...with a stick and ran away.
I was eight years old.
You've come to make me
deaf in my other ear?
Kantilal
He has no business sense
Headmaster? You are in Turkey, right?
No, I'm here I want to do
business here with your son Jignesh
What business?
Many new things are available there.
I'II bring then and sell then
here I'll make good profit
And what does your father say?
He says I'll be ruined.
I've got to get my daughter married
I'll marry her and
take good care of her
My daughter is crazy.
Haven't you heard what those
bastard villagers are saying?
Jobless people keep
wagging their tongues.
There was a sickly looking youngster,
with a red flag and four labourers
She wanted to marry him have you heard
this at least or are you deaf too?
I was on the same
train as her that night
I know right from wrong
Just give me your blessing
and I'll take care of the girl
I'll take your leave.
Where did your wife go?
Don't scream she is not coming.
Why not?
- Let it be.
What catastrophe
is keeping her here?
Don't know. Maybe
she doesn't like me
How can she not like you?
The witch is mad.
Not all women are sweet like you
Come on, bless me.
I know it's not your wish
but can't you bless me?
May God give you sense
Don't go.
What?
What if I die here all alone?
But you said you
didn't want to come
You could have asked me again
Look, you are not asking me even now.
But you don't even have any luggage?
Can't you buy me four saris?
And ticket?
Do I need a ticket
to sit on your lap?
Come.
Where is the Yarn market?
- This way
Where does all the buying and
selling happen? -Upstairs sir
Why do they shout so much?
How will we do business here?
Mathura Das?
Could be. Why?
I've come from Idhar
village in Gujarat
I want to do yarn
business with my own money
Wherever I go, people say there
is a union.
Yes.
You have to be a member.
Your bid's too high. You'll
get it much cheaper in Salem.
Quiet! Don't teach me business. If
you want to trade, become a member
So make me a member.
There's a five year waiting
period. Don't waste your time
You're not letting me do business
nor are you making me a member
Don't chew my head. Arzaan Contractor
is the president of the union
You can become a member only with
his letter. You won't become a member.
Are you a fortune teller?
Twenty five thousand like you come here
everyday. You'll never make it go away.
I'll stand right next
to you and do business.
What do you want?
Your letter. I want to
trade in the cloth market.
Come to the office.
I have. For four months.
I know Bhola's entire
family history.. your watchman
Do you play golf?
I play, but not this.
Play.
If this ball goes into that
hole you'll get your letter.
I've to put this ball in that hole..
..and you will give me the letter?
Of course.
For sure, right, if I do it?
Try it.
What's your name?
- Gurukant Desai
You'll give me the letter?
Ok. I'll see.
I've collected money for
business with great difficulty.
I'll take care.
In my village, help
is never forgotten
It'll happen. If
you don't mind. Yeah?
Let me get the change!
What's the hurry?
I've got something.
For me?
- Yes.
What?
What have bought for me?
This?
Don't you like it?
I thought you'll get me lots of saris,
jewelery, diamonds, 8-10 big cars
I will bring it all.
You'll see.
Can you see?
I can see.. it a
big house.. a palace
I can see brinjals

I see clothes in the wash.. wet
...you'll have to go in
your underwear tomorrow.
I can see you, fat, nau lakha necklace,
fat bangles..walking with a swagger..
..all five five hundred pounds of you
-I'll never be fat.
Ok slim one! Wearing
nau lakha necklace..
..fat bangles..
walking with a swagger.
Happy.
Very very very happy.
With you.
The brother-in-law is here
It's all over.
What?
Our business
But what happened?
Contractor's
rejected our application
Can't be. He gave me his word
I'm coming from his office
He tore up our application
So do we go back th the village now?
If we don't, we'll
be out on the streets
Who are you?
Who are you?
I live here.
I don't live here, okay?
Then why are you
staring at my building?
Why? Do I need a
letter even to look now?
The building is on the road,
the road is the Government's
these eyes are mine
the country is free
I can stare at whoever,
whenever I want. Don't bug me.
Go watch your dog piss
What's your name?
You've turned your
city into a dump
you've to wear a
suit and talk in English
Good. Being angry with
Bombay is very good
I am angry with one man
I want to slap him..
..Arzan Contractor..
..Four months ago and
then tore up my application
He doesn't wake up before ten
o'clock, how will you slap him?
Do you know him?
Since he was this little.
Can you do something for me?
I don't believe in giving
or taking recommendations
But you look like a big
social communist leader.
You should help the poor
And if I say no?
That's a problem I
can't hear the word 'no'
Come to my office tomorrow
Will you get the letter for me?
I'll make sure your voice is heard
How?
I will fight your war...
..but if you've lied I'll slap you
I've just arrived in Bombay,
I haven't learnt to lie yet
Good, come tomorrow.
Trading's big shot, Arzan Contractor..
The country is free but..
Mr Contractor considers himself
the undisputed lord of the union..
now nobody can stop Guru
from becoming a businessman
A very big businessman
Bigger than anybody...
am I talking too big?
A bit.
Here I am, right beside you
But you won't last - There
are a dime a dozen like you..
I didn't know you had so
many complaints against oe.
You should have talked to me,
not the papers
It' s difficult to meet you
Today you're in
trouble so you've come here...
or you go only to the club
I am resigning.
No.
Let him go, someone
else will come along
Quiet. You needn't go sir
He's decided.
Now even God can't make him
change his decision, isn't it?
My decision won't
change but times will
Anything could happen tomorrow,
don't come crying to me
If we're going to be that scared,
how'll we do business?
Don't worry we are the fearless
What was your name again?
Not 'was', it still is
and will always be Gurukant Desai
Where is that villager Guru?
Meenu, what do we do with him
You can become a member only with
his letter. You won't become a member
I'll do it.
Which tooth?
This one.
My name is Meenakshi
Jalkukdi.. Meenu. No.
-Yes.  -No.
She won't accept defeat
It's too small a place for you...
That he doesn't have faith in
himself and has to depend on God
He was right.
No, God and I don't get along
You'll get both or neither
She's smarter than you.
Why don't you treat the
prasad as a sweet and...
I'll treat the tilak as just colour
You've to have your way
Such a struggle for a fine sweet!
Who is this villager?
My brother-in-law and partner
What business?
Cotton.
- Polyester.
Very good.. a fight
on the very first day
My brother is sleeping outside
I am not asking you to wake him.
What will you do now?
What do you think?
You beast... you brought us
here like a big leader..
..how are you going to
clothe and feed us?
Polyester.
What's that?
Soft, shiny, naughty.. just like you
I made a big mistake marrying you.
I can't understand whether you..
..love your me or your yarn more
Should I tell you?
Das was saying the polyester
business is dangerous. - Let him
Are you brainless? The whole
world is into cotton and you
When you see the profit
you'll say wow Guru,
how intelligent you are!
How much did you invest?
All the money.
Oh God, you'll kill us.
We'll think about
that when we get killed
They say it's gambling
Gambling?
But the fun of business is
predicting which price will rise...
and fall.. where the
losses and profits are..
...that shows the
acumen of the businessman.
The Government calls that gambling
Mahalaxmi, horse races and
astrology. All that's gambling too
You came and ruined everyone
Not me.
No problem.
Let's do our businesses from here
send everybody else in as well
This is a Government
notice from an I.A.S. Officer...
It's the law now.
If a law can be made in a day..
..then it can also
be changed in a day
Come... this way.
Mr. K.R. Menon?
Who are you?
So you stopped the trading?
- What are these?
Uniforms, ask him to stop.
- Come in
Stop.
All the goods are yours.
What nonsense. Who are you?
My father-in-law is a moneylender
..people who borrowed money from him and
failed to pay up, had theirs taken.
If a ghee shop was shut down
then he would keep the buffaloes..
I had a polyester shop and..
you shut it down so
now all this is yours
Top quality polyester
Make clothes for the children
Gurukant Desai.
Menon sir, Good day.
I've been looking
for you for four days.
Mr Menon, A very
big I.A.S officer
Look, my record is impeccable..
..if the higher
authorities find out about the..
polyester, I will lose my job
What can I do about that air?
Take it all back,
neighbours have begun to talk
But until the market opens I
can't take the goods back
Are you threatening me?
No sir, but the other traders were..
..also going to come to your
house to leave their goods..
How can I re-open the market?
I'm an illiterate villager,
I don't know much, but if you closed the market..
..then you must have the keys
And if I say no?
What?
And if I say no?
I don't understand the word 'no'
Good show.
Guruji has come. He has
brought gifts for all
You forgot the jalkukdi?
Close your eyes.
Now open them.
A wedding sari!
You'll marry me?
For seven lifetimes...
Very nice.
I'll show it to everyone.
So Gurubhai?
I'm like your son.
The name suits you.
Come on, get up.
I know you're not even
going to touch this...
you look like
Gandhiji in this dhoti
But when you travel abroad...
and it's very cold you can make
a coat like Nehru's and wear it
...it'll look very nice.
Are you bribing me throwing
Gandhiji and Nehru's names in?
No. I don't know how to shake
hands and say thank you in English
If you don't like it...
then break both my
neck and teeth, Okay?
This is what I like about you..
..suddenly you speak with
honesty and intelligence
Don't ever let go of this habit
Whatever happens, I'II
never let it go. I promise
Finish it in one gulp.
He won't drink, his
wife will scream at him
All wives scold.. if you
drink a bit, you'll hear less
I apologize for being late
I was doing our trial balance...
..our profits are up
by 300% in six months
And the price of polyester
has gone through the roof!
But don't relax, because if
we've worked 18 hours till today
we will now work 25 hours per day
Ask why?
Because the Shakti
family will not only trade...
..we will make kela silk.
We are opening a factory
Foreign machines will produce the..
..English named
kela silk.. polyester.
Just because you 've
bought a ram doesn't mean..
..that you dream of
opening a factory
We've also seen the land 25
acres right next to your village
Walk carefully, don't
be in such a hurry
I'm carrying you in my
arms, so don't fall
And the money?
Are you Contractor, that the
banks will give you a loan?
..we will go to the public..
give ten rupees..
..and become the owner..
public issue..
..if the factory earns,
so will everyone.
Permission for the public
issue will come in one month
Fantastic! Let's have
another one on this!
You didn't ask me...
..you could've at
least taken my opinion
You wouldn't have let us sell
polyester, or anything else
You were about to pack up
and go back to the village
We are partners...
...it's not just you.
You just stay behind me
and watch the world.
If you stick your nose in,
I'll turn you into polyester
and sell you to a foreign lady
Little prince is upset.. no problem.
I'll pacify him and bring him back
Where are you going?
-to the Station
Come back. Everyone's watching
I can't get along with him
This is not a silly game
that you get upset and leave
I'm going to the village.
We'll all go together, and put
up a huge board.. Shakti factory
I don't want any of this
People will say that
you're jealous of him
Who will say?
- Even I will!
You've gone mad and blind
Your problem is with me..
..speak properly to your sister
Can't you see that he is looking after both of
us. You need to understhand him
He only understands money. Do
you know why he married you?
He was a true friend. He
married a girl who was eloping
He would have married you
even if you were handicapped
You know why? Tell her
You are talking like a child
He married you for dowry.
Tell him not to lie.
Ask him...
Father had promised a
big dowry, 25 thousand..
..he wanted to start his business
Tell him not to lie...
You're just capital.
He's lying, isn't he?
Is this true?
Fight with the whole world,
but not with me
If you're with me, I
can beat the whole world
Then why are you stuck
to my neck? Come on...
Where?
To beat the world.
You've come?
On time.
How was the Europe and America tour?
Very successful.
Only one difficulty..
..I didn't get to eat
her cooking I starved
business king of India.
Do you have Shakti shares?
- Yes.
Then you are India's
business king too
People are pointing fingers
at your growth.
You're growing too fast
This is a race, and I ran
to win, not for pleasure
No.
- Hey Jalkukdi...
You look beautiful
just like a bride
Really? Actually I knew
That's why this Parsi
uncle's been troubling me
So when are you marrying me?
Leave Didi let' s get
into my car and run away
Can you cook like her?
I'm talking love and you're
talking about your stomach..
..how do you live with him?
With great difficulty
Where's Nanaji?
America... he's back in two weeks
Gurubhai! Namaste bhabhi
How many months?
How did you know, I
haven't even told the beast
You glow.. it's a
girl, just like me
Dad. Gurukant Desai.
So you're Gurubhai.
And you're the senior Mr
Contractor.. pleasure
I've a present for you...
..that's why I wanted
you to come to the wedding
But I brought a present only
for your daughter not for you
A blank cheque. Your
math is very good
So fill it up with any number
Everything has a price.
Where you've reached today
on your own, is amazing
But the path ends here.
Don't put it down. You might
not get another opportunity
Who is it?
- Bloody old man.
He wants to buy me.
He is putting a price tag on me?
What he made in 150
years I made in 10 years
Is it the same?
- No.
Get all our friends
from the press right now!
