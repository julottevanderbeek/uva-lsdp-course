what can you say
about a 25-year-old girl
who died?
That she was beautiful
and brilliant?
That she loved
mozart and bach...
the beatles... and me?
Do you have the waning of the middle ages?
You have your own
library, preppie.
Would you answer
my question?
Would you
answer mine first?
Look, we're
allowed to use
the radcliffe
library.
I am not talking legality, preppie.
I'm talking ethics.
Harvard's got
five million books,
and radcliffe's got
a few loussy thousand.
All i want is one.
I've got an exam tomorrow, damn it.
Please watch your profanity, preppie.
What makes you so sure i went to prep school?
You look stupid
and rich.
Actually,
i'm smart and poor.
Uh-uh.i'm
smart and poor.
What makes you
so smart?
I wouldn't go
for coffee with you.
Well, i wouldn't
ask you.
Well, that's what
makes you stupid.
Ah. Comp. Lit. 105,
not bad.
Music 150, not bad.
Music 201--
that's a graduate course.
Renaissance
polyphony.
What's polyphony?
Nothing sexual,
preppie.
Look, miss cavilleri,
i told you my name is oliver.
First or last?
First.
Oliver what?
Barrett.
Barrett like
the poet?
Yeah. No relation.
Barrett like
the hall?
Yes.
I'm having coffee with a harvard building.
You're barrett hall.
I'm not barrett hall.
My great-grandfather happened
to give the thing to harvard.
So his not-so-great
grandson
would be able to
get in.
If you're so convinced
i'm a loser,
why did you bulldoze me
into buying you coffee?
I like your body.
I major in
social studies.
It doesn't show.
It's an honors
program.
I know you've got
at least a few brains.
Really?
Yeah. You're hung up
on me, aren't you?
Jenny!
Yeah?
Listen, you conceited
radcliffe bitch,
friday night's the dartmouth hockey game.
So?
So i want you
to come.
Why the hell should i go
to a lousy hockey game?
Because i'm playing.
For which side?
two minutes,
number 7. Holding.
barrett, two minutes, holding.
why are you sitting here when your friends are playing?
I'm in
the penalty box.
What?
The penalty box.
What did you do wrong?
I tried too hard.
Is that a disgrace?
I'm trying
to concentrate.
On what?
How i'm going to total
that dartmouth bastard!
Come on, arthur.
Let's go!
Are you a dirty player?
Would you ever total me?
I will right now
if you don't shut up.
I'm leaving. Good-bye.
barrett's back in the game.
Harvard at full strength.
Go, team, go!
Go, team, go!
Harvard goal--
hackman. Assist, barrett.
So now i've seen
a hockey game.
What'd you like best?
When you were
on your ass.
Thanks for coming.
Did i say you could?
What?
Kiss me.
I was carried away.
I wasn't.
I may not call you
for a few months.
Why?
Then again,
i might call you as soon as i get back to my room.
Bastard.
You dish it out,
but you can't take it.
Hello, animals.
Hey, ollie.
What'd you get?
An assist
on the last goal.
Off cavilleri?
None of your business.
I'm your roommate!
Who's this?
Barrett got
a new goody?
Jenny cavilleri.
Who?
Some music type from rhode island somewhere.
I know the one.
Real tight-ass.
Plays piano for
the bach society.
What does she play
with barrett?
Probably
hard-to-get.
Simpson.
Yeah?
Up yours.
Ha ha ha!
That proves it.
hello, jen?
What would you say
if i told you...
i think i'm in love
with you?
Never say love if
you don't mean it.
Why wouldn't i
mean it?
You're a known
quantity, barrett.
Meaning?
You're known
for quantity.
I mean at radcliffe,
every hall is barrett hall.
You've been checking up on me,
haven't you?
I don't dine outdoors
with just anybody.
Am i just anybody?
What do you think,
preppie?
Mmm! Listen, you're, uh,
you're going to have to
fend for yourself
this weekend.
See, i'm going to be
mixing it up
with
francis lapierre.
Very funny.
Are you jealous?
Francis lapierre
is the captain
of the cornell
hockey team.
Oh, you've been, uh,
reading the sports
page, huh?
You know,
i wouldn't mind
watching you play hockey
this weekend.
No.
I'll be involved.
Oh, yeah.
The all-ivy title.
More than
the all-ivy title?
Hell of a lot more.
cornell goal, cashay.
Score tied, 3-3.
come on, barrett!
Break it up!
I'll kick your ass
back to montreal.
Break it up! Come on!
All right!
Break it up, you guys!
Come on! Get up!
you're out of the game, barrett!
Come on!
i'll break yours
before you break mine!
Come on, barrett!
Get off the ice.
Get off the ice!
You chicken-shit!
You montreal faggots!
What are you
talking about?
Lapierre started
the fight!
Get in there!
Oh, come on!
five minutes for number 7.
Fight.
Penalty,
barrett of harvard,
five minutes for fighting.
probably want
a steak, son.
Thank you, father,
but the doctor took care of it.
I meant for your stomach, oliver.
I think i'm supposed
to eat with the team, sir.
Oh, well,
that's fine.
Does your face
hurt?
No, sir.
I'd like jack wells to take a look at it monday.
It's not necessary, sir.
Jack's a specialist,
you know.
It's not--
nothing special.
My car's over there.
Can i give you a lift?
I'll walk you
to your car.
Tell me, oliver,
have you heard from the law school?
Father, i haven't--
i haven't exactly decided
on the law school.
I was merely asking
whether
the law school
had decided on you.
No, sir.
There really isn't
any doubt.
About what, sir?
The law school needs
good men like you.
They haven't got
a hockey team.
You have other
qualities, oliver.
I'm sorry you had to come
to see harvard lose.
I came to
see you play.
You know, oliver,
the dean of the law school
is an old classmate.
That's very nice,
sir.
Well, good-bye.
Good-bye, sir.
Give my best
to mother.
Yes, i will.
briggs hall.
Sandy davidson!
Jennifer cavilleri.
You have a call
on two.
She's in the downstairs
phone booth.
Where's that?
Around the corner.
briggs hall.
Would you please--
would you please--
for god's sake, phil!
Yes.
Yeah, yeah. For the million
and oneth time, yeah.
Absolutely.
Oh, i love you,
too, phil.
Yeah. I love you, too.
Mwah! Good-bye.
Hi.
What happened to you?
You look terrible.
I'm injured.
Did you make the other guy look worse?
I always make the other guy look worse.
Jenny--
yeah?
Who's phil?
My father.
You call
your father phil?
That's his name.
What do you call your father?
Son of a bitch.
To his face?
I never see his face.
Why? Does he
wear a mask?
In a way.
He must be
proud as hell.
Here you are,
this big harvard jock.
So was he.
Bigger than all-ivy?
He rowed single sculls
in the 1928 olympics.
Oh. Did he win?
No.
Then why is he
a son of a bitch?
He leans on me.
He makes me do the right things.
What's wrong with
doing the right things?
I don't like
to be programmed,
to put out "x" amount of achievement every term.
I've noticed you hate making
dean's list and being all-ivy.
He expects no less,
and when i come through,
he's so blase
and indifferent.
That's ridiculous.
You know all he said
after the game?
He went to ithaca
to watch you play?
After we blew
the title
and i was nearly massacred by canadian hordes,
do you know what the big banker said to his son?
Hordes
in ithaca?
"The dean of the law school was a classmate."
What did you expect?
"How's your sex life?"
Whose side
are you on, jenny?
I didn't know
it was a war.
You don't
understand.
I understand more
than you wish i did.
Did your father--
the son of a bitch--
at least get
lousy grades?
He was
a rhodes scholar.
Aha! I think i
notice a problem
of overachievement
in the barrett family.
Forget it. There's
no problem, o.k.?
Right. No problem.
Do i call my father
on the phone?
Do i bill and coo and say,
"i love you, phil"?
No.
There you are.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because his name
is oliver.
Ha ha ha!
Ah, the great
barrett hall.
Don't you salute
when you pass it?
Ugliest building
on campus.
I've never even
been inside.
That's a very mature
attitude.
It's not easy having history stare you in the face.
How many people have to cope with a barrett hall?
I could name two.
Thanks.
cavilleri,
i've got nothing against music,
but must you play it
while we study?
I'm studying the music.
It's called
analysis of form.
Yeah.
You're going to flunk out
just watching me study.
I'm not watching you study.
I'm studying.
Bullshit. You're
looking at my legs.
Listen, you're not
that great-looking.
Can i help it
if you think so?
Let's change
the subject, huh?
I wasn't aware that there was a subject.
You thought i wanted to make love to you.
Did i?
But i'm
not interested.
Definitely.
Not interested.
Good. At least we've got
one thing in common.
I know your game,
and i'm tired of playing it.
You are the supreme
radcliffe smart-ass.
The best. You put down
anything in pants.
But verbal volleyball is not my idea of a relationship.
If that's what
you think it's about,
go back to your music wonks,
and good luck.
See, i think
you're scared.
You put up a wall to keep from getting hurt,
but it also keeps you
from getting touched.
It's a risk,
isn't it, jenny?
At least i had the guts
to admit what i felt.
Someday, you'll have to
come up with the courage
to admit you care.
I care.
Do you think your priest
would like this?
I don't have one.
Aren't you a good
catholic girl?
Well, i'm a girl...
and i'm good, right?
Mmm.
So, that's two
out of three.
Why do you wear it?
It was my mother's.
Why'd you leave?
What?
Why'd you leave
the church?
I don't know.
I never really joined.
I mean, i guess
i never thought
there was another world
better than this one.
I mean, what could be
better than mozart...
or bach...
or you?
Jenny?
Hmm?
I'm up there with
bach and mozart?
Mm-hmm.
And the beatles.
simpson, let me
sack in your couch.
How come?
Barrett.
Who's the guest
of honor?
Cavilleri.
Again? Still?
Barrett's slipping.
It's amazing.
Huh?
I'm studying.
I'm really studying.
Shh.i'mstudying.
Sorry. Sorry.
Oliver?
Hmm?
I love you.
i can't believe
how great you were.
That tells me what you know about music.
I know enough.
Wise up. I was not
great or all-ivy.
I was just o.k.,
o.k.?
O.k.
i mean, you should
always keep at it.
Who said i'm not?
I'm going to study
with nadia boulanger,
aren't i?
Who?
Next year.
I have a scholarship in paris.
Paris?
Yeah. I've never
been to europe.
I can hardly wait.
How long have you
known about this?
Come on, ollie,
don't be stupid. It's inevitable.
What is?
That we'll go
our separate ways
and you'll
go to law school.
What are you
talking about?
You're a preppie
millionaire,
and i'm
a social zero.
What does that have to do
with separating?
We're happy.
Harvard is like this
big santa claus bag
stuffed full
of crazy toys,
but when
the holiday's over--
this has been more
than a holiday.
Back
where you belong.
To cranston, rhode island,
to bake cookies?
Pastries.
Don't make fun of my father.
Then don't
leave me, jenny!
Please.
What about my scholarship,
and what about paris
that i've never seen in my whole goddamn life?
What about
our marriage?
Who said anything
about marriage?
I'm saying it now.
You want to
marry me?
Yeah.
Why?
Because.
That's a good
reason.
you're driving like a maniac.
this is boston.
Everybody drives
like a maniac.
You'll kill us before your parents can murder us.
My parents will fall in love with you.
Even
the son of a bitch?
Of course. Absolutely.
Hey, where's the old
radcliffe confidence?
Back at radcliffe.
It's going to be
o.k., jenny.
What did you say
on the phone?
Just that i'd
drop in to visit.
Very casual, huh?
Yeah, right.
How often do you visit during the term?
Never.
Oh. That's casual.
holy shit!
Hey, stop, oliver.
No kidding.
Stop the car.
i didn't think it would be like this.
Like what?
I mean, like,
this rich.
This is too much
for me.
Don't worry, jenny.
It'll be a breeze.
Yeah, but why is it
that i suddenly wish
my name were abigail adams or wendy wasp?
Don't be scared.
Aren't you?
No.
So far, so good.
That's not saying much.
Your hand is cold.
So is yours.
Let's get away from here
while we can.
master oliver! Hello!
Hello, florence.
This is jenny.
Master? I always knew
you had slaves.
Let me take your wrap.
Your parents are
in the drawing room.
Thank you, florence.
Wow.
I see half the buildings of harvard
hanging
on that wall.
Oh, it's nothing.
Hey, you didn't
tell me
you were related to
the sewell boathouse.
Yes, i come from a long line of wood and stone.
ah, hello there!
Um...
i--i'd like you to meet jennifer calaveri.
Cavilleri.
As incavalleria rusticana?
Right. No relation.
Hello, mom.
Hello, darling.
So nice to meet you.
How are you, son?
Fine.
Fine, sir. Fine.
please sit down
and make yourself
at home.
We'll have to be
going soon.
Why are you so uncomfortable with your parents?
What gave you
that impression?
Why did you
want to leave
the minute
we got there?
I didn't like the way
they were treating you.
"What is it your parents
are in, jennifer?"
What is it your people
are in, jennifer?
My father
bakes cookies.
Oh? What's the name
of his firm?
Phil's bake shop.
of cranston, rhode island.
How interesting.
So your people come
from cranston, jenny.
Well, mostly.
My mother came
from fall river.
The barretts have mills
in fall river.
Where they exploited the new
england poor for generations.
In the 19th century.
When you inherit,
oliver,
you can give all our money back as reparations.
Well, that's exactly what the
philosopher saint-simon advocated.
In the 18th century.
It's getting late.
For what?
You're staying for dinner,
aren't you?
No. Yes.
No. I've got to
get back.
Nonsense. You're staying
for dinner,
and that's an order.
Everything is
an order,
a directive,
a command.
Where is your
sense of humor?
You know,
when i was in school,
he used to send me
memos. Memos!
I mean, don't you
find that rather odd?
I find it
rather cute.
Tell me, oliver, have you heard
from law school?
Uh, no, sir, not yet.
He'll get in.
Who is better than oliver?
I quite agree.
He's bound to be graduated
with honors.
Oliver has always done well in school.
At exeter,
he was the very--
it doesn't mean
a thing.
A lot of guys are trying
to get into law school.
I could give
price zimmerman a ring--
no!
I mean,
please don't, sir.
Merely to find out
if he knows.
I want to get my letter
with everyone else, please.
He was only trying
to be helpful.
But, jenny, i don't need
that kind of help.
O.k.
no, it's not o.k.!
He's not going to
be satisfied
till he cuts them off.
What?
What you wouldn't like
to be cut off.
Oh...
well, we've got to
take care of those.
Take care, you two!
Drive with caution,
oliver.
Get there a minute later,
but get there.
You really like to bug your father,
don't you?
The feeling's mutual,
or haven't you noticed?
I didn't think you'd stop at anything
just to get
to your old man.
It's impossible to get
to oliver barrett iii.
Unless maybe...
if you marry
jennifer cavilleri?
is that what you think?
Yes, i think
it's part of it.
Jenny, you don't believe
i love you?
Yes, but in a crazy
sort of way,
i think
you also love
my negative
social status.
No.
Listen, i can't pass
judgment, oliver.
I just think so.
I mean...
i know that i love
not only you,
but your name
and your numeral.
After all, it's part
of what you are.
Oh, how can you do it?
What?
How can you see me
and still love me?
That's what
it's about, preppie.
how are you, son?
Oh, i'm o.k.
o.k., sir.
Did you hear
from law school?
Yes. I called you,
remember?
Oh, yes, yes.
Congratulations.
You'll be the first barrett
on the supreme court.
Oh, i may just chase
ambulances instead.
Yes, fine.
How's raymond?
He's fine.
Got into o.c.s.
army?
Mm-hmm.
That's good.
That's bad.
You haven't
mentioned jennifer.
What's there to say?
You're presenting us with afait accompli,
are you not?
But what
did you think?
I think
she's absolutely charming,
and i think for a girl
from her background
to get all the way
to radcliffe is--
get to the point.
The point doesn't concern
the young lady.
It concerns you.
Your rebellion.
Ah.
And you are rebelling,
oliver.
i fail...
i fail to see how marrying
a beautiful and brilliant radcliffe girl
constitutes
rebellion.
I mean, she's not
some crazy hippie.
She's not many things.
What irks you
most, father?
That she's catholic
or that she's poor?
What attracts you most?
I'm leaving.
Don't go off
half-cocked, damn it!
I would only ask
that you... wait a bit.
Define "bit."
Finish law school.
If this thing is real,
it will stand
the test of time.
I don't see why
i have to put it
to some
arbitrary test.
Because
i'm asking you to.
You're
commanding me!
Oliver,
if you marry her now,
i'll not give you
the time of day.
Father, you don'tknow the time of day.
we're, uh,
looking forward
to having you
with us next year.
Me, too,
dean thompson.
Uh, something's come up.
Not a change
of heart, i hope.
No, no, i'm still set
on law school, but...
i'm going to need a scholarship.
Really?
That's why i'm here.
That's, uh--
well, that's
rather curious,
considering
your background.
I'm not his son anymore.
I beg your pardon?
Well, uh...
we have had a--
a misunderstanding.
It's a parting
of the ways.
This is...
very unfortunate,
mr. Barrett.
I am not exactly
jumping for joy.
Yet, uh,
we have many entering students
in far worse straits
than you.
What's worse than the straits of destitution?
Dean thompson,
i'm getting married next month.
Now, we're both going to
work all summer,
and then jenny's
going to take a job
in a private school,
teaching.
That's a living,
but it's not tuition.
Your tuition
is pretty steep.
Yes.
Dean thompson,
i need a scholarship.
I'm a harvard magna.
I've already been accepted.
I don't have any money
in the bank.
You have
a millionaire father.
Had, dean, had.
Why should i be
penalized
because i was once
related to a rich man?
Uh, mr. Barrett,
i really don't think
that this office
should enter
into a...
family quarrel?
A rather distressing one,
at that.
I see.
Thank you.
Uh...
perhaps...
at midyear--
thank you.
You've been very generous
with your time.
we just passed my junior high school!
i can't believe he liked my instant poverty.
He did, i swear.
At least now you've got something in common.
God, when i first told him oliver barrett--
yeah? Yeah?
I mean, he just
couldn't believe it.
He kept
reminding me
of the 11th
commandment.
"Do not bullshit
thy father."
Any other commandments
i ought to know about?
Yeah. "Stay loose."
so, is he for it?
Does he approve?
What do you think?
i won't allow it!
I won't allow it!
Get me?
You're tilting
at windmills, phil!
Stop referring to his father as a windmill.
He's a distinguished
citizen of boston--
mr. Cavilleri--
phil.
My name is phil.
I'll call his goddamn father.
I'll go to boston!
It won't do any good,
goddamn it!
Would you please not use profanity in this house?
You do.
What the hell
will he think?
That you've lost
your marbles.
Because i won't allow
a parent to reject a child?
Mr. Cavilleri--
phil. Ha ha ha!
Phil.
Phil, sir,
i reject him, too.
Now, don't talk
like that, oliver.
A father's love is something
to cherish and respect.
It's a rare thing.
Especially
in my family.
Let's get him
on the phone.
No, no. You see,
my father and i
have installed
this cold line.
He'll thaw, oliver.
He'll thaw, and he'll melt.
Believe me, when it's time
to go to church--
let's get him
on the phone.
Uh, wait. Phil.
What?
Um,
about
the church bit.
Well, we're kind of
negative on it.
Oh. Ha ha!
Well, i-- i didn't necessarily m-mean the catholic church.
I, uh--
you-- you know
that, uh,
jennifer
is catholic.
She may have
told you that.
And her...
sainted mother
always dreamed
of a--
well, the whole
mass rigmarole,
but-but you're--
well, god would bless this union in any church.
Uh, phil--
yeah.
About the god bit.
Yeah?
Well, we're sort of negative
about that, too.
About god?
About anybody's god?
See...
we neither one of us
believe...
and we won't be
hypocrites.
Well.
Well, uh...
if that's
what you wish,
just tell me
who performs the wedding.
We do.
You mean,
do-it-yourself?
Huh?
Ha ha! Ha ha!
That's, uh--
that's wonderful.
I know i'm--
i mean, that's--
that's... just--
just wonderful.
Do-- do it yourself, huh?
I think that's...
just wonderful.
But, uh, tell me.
Is-- is it, uh--
what's the word?
You mean legal?
Legal. Is that it?
Is it?
Yes.
One of the college chaplains just sort of--
oh!
No, i mean
he presides over it,
and then the man and the woman
address each other.
You mean
the bride speaks, too?
Ha ha ha!
It's a new world,
philip.
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it's-- it's-- it's new,
all right.
You two ready?
Amen.
They haven't
started yet.
friends--
how would i know?
I've never been
to a do-it-yourself.
Let us listen
to the words
they've chosen to read
on this sacred occasion.
Amen.
huh?
He said "sacred'"
the priest.
he's not a priest.
He is to me.
When our two souls stand up erect and strong,
face to face,
silent, drawing
nigh and nigher
until the lengthening
wings break into fire
at either curved
point,
what bitter wrong can the earth do to us
that we should not long be here contented?
Think.
In mounting higher,
the angels
would press on us
and aspire to drop some golden orb of perfect song
into our deep,
dear silence.
Let us stay rather
on earth, beloved,
where the unfit,
contrarious moods of men
recoil away...
and isolate
pure spirits...
and permit a place to stand and love in for a day,
with darkness and the death-hour rounding it.
I give you my hand.
I give you my love,
more precious than money.
I give you myself before preaching or law.
Will you give me
yourself?
Will you
come travel with me?
Shall we stick
by each other
as long as we live?
I, oliver barrett...
take you,
jennifer cavilleri,
to be my wedded wife
from this day forward...
to love and to cherish
till death do us part.
I, jennifer
cavilleri,
take you,
oliver barrett,
as my wedded husband
from this day
forward,
to love
and to cherish
till death
do us part.
By the authority
vested in me
by the commonwealth
of massachusetts,
i pronounce you
man and wife.
so i'm being kept by a woman.
you won't like it.
I already do.
Oliver,
the shady lane school
is only paying me
three thou a year.
Why?
Because my goddamn name
is mrs. Barrett.
Well, couldn't you
be miss cavilleri?
If i was miss cavilleri,
i'd be the queen
of paris.
I tell you,
it's a great bargain.
Oliver, 4 rooms
for $82.50 a month
is impossible
this side of mongolia.
Ah, but this is the mongolian section of cambridge.
gee.
I have to admit
that it's...
even worse
than i expected.
Ha ha!
Yeah, but it's home.
Yeah.
Well?
Well what?
There's the threshold.
Carry me over it.
You don't believe in that nonsense,
do you?
Carry me.
I'll tell you later.
We're almost
at the top floor.
O.k., i'll be a young
and beautiful divorcee.
Hey, what is this,
barrett?
Oh, what is this?
I'll tell you after we cross
the threshold.
Ha ha ha!
O.k.?
This is not
a threshold.
Well, i see our name
by the bell.
Look, it's not an official
goddamn threshold.
Now, upstairs,
you preppie.
Why are you
so heavy?
Did you ever think
i might be pregnant?
Are you?
Ha ha! Scared you,
didn't i?
No, i--
don't bullshit me.
Well, yeah,
for a second, i clutched.
Now, is this the official threshold?
What do you think,
huh?
I think if you don't
say yes, i'll--
yes! Yes!
Ha ha ha!
is there a barrett in the house?
Hey, where are
the kids?
Asleep, thank god!
It's siesta time.
I've got 45 minutes.
That's more
than they give me.
oh, damn it.
I don't know what's wrong
with this engine.
You're
a harvard magna.
Not in mechanics.
Welcome to the world,
preppie.
Listen, cavilleri--
the name's barrett,
barrett.
Sometimes you are
really a bitch.
How are they
treating you?
Fine, except for
the rittenhouse brat.
I swear he'll be breaking and entering before he's ten.
Oh, yeah? What now?
He tried to pinch me.
Ha ha!
I don't blame him.
Next time he does,
i'm going to wallop him.
Jesus, no!
Not until you get his parents' tip.
damn it.
Ha ha ha!
Let's get the hell
out of here.
Hey, don't touch me,
oliver.
What a thing to say
to your husband.
Wash, and you can
touch me afterwards.
I will.
Hey, i had another
salary hassle today
with miss
anne miller whitman.
I hope you laid it on
thick this time.
I told her how proud
i was to be a member
of the faculty of
the shady lane school.
I said, "you know,
miss whitman,
even barretts
have to pay their rent."
To which
she retorted?
"Ho ho ho."
Uh,
define "ho ho ho."
Oh, that's
ridiculous.
Listen, how would you
like to supportme
while i take the courses necessary
to teach in public school?
Would you please
say something?
Ho ho ho.
i thought you'd call
when the meeting
broke.
Yeah, but i wanted you
to study.
Did you eat?
Uh-uh.
I waited for you.
But you're
a growing boy.
Ha ha!
Not anymore.
Yes, you are, in mind.
Did you check the mail?
Just one second,
jenny.
This is a crucial
precedent.
Did you check
the mail?
No, i didn't.
Anything vital?
We are cordially
invited--
to pay
the light bill.
To a dinner.
Your father's
Did you hear me?
Yes.
R.s.v.p.
you even have to ask?
Oliver, i think
it's about time.
For what?
You know
very well what.
Does he have to
crawl here?
Negative.
He's reaching out
to you.
My mother
addressed it.
Oliver, think.
Nothing says
he'll be around
when you're
finally ready
for
a reconciliation.
There won'tbe
a reconciliation.
Someday when
you're being bugged
by oliver v--
he won't be
oliver v!
He can be
bozo the clown,
and he'll still
resent you
because you were
a harvard jock!
You'll probably be
on the supreme court.
He won't resent me!
Why not?
Because--
your father loves you,
too, oliver,
just the way
you'll love bozo,
but you barretts are
so proud and competitive
you'll go
through your whole life
thinking you hate
each other.
If it weren't
for you!
Yes!
The case
is closed!
There's still
the matter
of the r.s.v.p.
i think
you can handle it.
In my whole life,
i have never deliberately hurt anyone,
and i just
don't think i could.
Jennifer,
just answer "no."
O.k.
what's the number?
Can't you
just write a note?
In a few minutes, i'll lose my nerve.
What's the number?
and dial one first.
Good evening.
This is
jennifer barrett.
Oh, mr. Barrett.
Good evening, sir.
Fine, thank you.
Yes, we did.
That's why i'm calling.
I'm terribly
sorry, sir.
I mean...
we're
terribly sorry,
but no, we can't.
I'm sorry.
Oliver, please
talk to him.
Just say hello.
I will never talk
to him.
Please, can't you
just do it for me?
I've never asked you to do anything in my whole life.
Please, oliver,
just for me.
No.
you're a heartless
bastard.
Mr.
Barrett, oliver would like you to know
that in his
own special way,
he loves you
very much.
get the hell
out of my life!
i forgot my key.
Jenny, i--
i'm sorry.
Don't.
Love means never
having to say you're sorry.

But i wasn't!
Yes, you were.
Paul, don't

You were

sorry, jenny.
O.k.,
one last time,
and this time,
i want crisp diction.

That was really,
incredibly,
absolutely...
not bad.
Oh, jenny,
come on!
Come on, jenny!
Oh, come on.
Tomorrow at 8:30
sharp, o.k.?
I'll see you
tomorrow at 8:30.
Bye, jenny.
Bye, jenny.
See you.
Bye, jenny.
Well, barrett,
what brings you
to church?
The saloons
closed early.
Did you get us
a tree?
Ah.
We'll get one
on the way home.
What are you doing
new year's eve?
Sleeping.
I thought you wanted
to spend it with me.
What are you
doing?
Sleeping.
Someday we're
going to look back
on these days.
The sooner
the better.
keep running!
Go! Really run!
Come on!
Keep going!
Come on! Come on!
Come on, dan.
Come on.
Hey, jennifer,
come here!
I'm with children.
Can't it wait?
Jennifer, i said
come here.
What?
Come on!
Start it over
again.
What the hell
is it?
I've got
something important
i want
to tell you.
Couldn't you
tell me over there?
No. I want to be
alone with you.
O.k.
fantastic news.
Here. Read.
Harvard law school?
You got kicked out.
Read it,
will you please?
It's great news.
You were first
in the class?
Uh, not quite.
Third.
Only third, huh?
Hey,
but that means
i make
the law review.
Well, say something,
will you, please?
Not until i've met
numbers one and two.
and the william dejersey
memorial award
for the finest senior essay
to oliver barrett iv.
The family of mark howells,
a.b. '07, l.l.b. '10--
on your feet.
How much?
Holy sh--
get up.
Shhh! Quiet!
Come on.
Come on.
The jennifer barrett
maternity award.
Well, it was
a good apartment
for 80 bucks.
Now our garage
will cost that much.
I don't see why
you'll need your car
in new york.
House calls, jenny.
Fancy lawyers
for jonas and marsh
don't make house calls.
They do
to the houses
of mr. Jonas
and mr. Marsh.
They are both
close enough to walk.
Jenny,
rich people ride.
Nouveau riche
people.
That's us.
Hey, jenny,
you won't laugh.
What?
I'm actually
getting to like
the name bozo.
For what?
For our kid,
damn it--
our huge and bruising
all-ivy tackle.
Bozo barrett?
It's the name of a real harvard superjock.
You would
actually call
our soon-to-be-conceived
offspring "bozo?"
Only if he's a boy.
We have finally crossed the poverty line.
Not quite.
Not till you carry me
over the goddamn
threshold.
I thought we had
run that gamut.
But you weren't
a lawyer,
so it wasn't legal.
We live
on the 10th floor.
You can carry me
in the elevator.
Thank god for that.
Can i help you folks?
We've got bags
in the car.
Is the lady
all right?
I will be
when he carries me
over the threshold.
Newlyweds, huh?
Eternally.
Move your ass,
preppie.
You've got it made,
you bastard.
Made in the shade.
Snug as a bug
in a rug.
Cut the crap
and play.
Working for
jonas and marsh,
pulling in
the coin.
Play, damn it.
I can't help it.
Married to
foul-mouth angel-face.
Pay attention,
will you?
Why should you
have all the luck?
Hey, man, it was
a long, hard drag.
This is
the first week
in our
entire marriage
that jenny
hasn't had to work.
So, what's she
going to do?
I want her to study
at julliard,
and she wants
to have a baby,
so we're
making babies.
Do you need
any help, old buddy?
I'll call you
if i need you.
do you know
whose fault it is?
I wouldn't use
the word fault, oliver.
O.k., we'll put it
your way.
Two 24-year-olds
can't seem
to make a baby.
Obviously, one of us
is malfunctioning.
Who?
Jenny.
All right, then,
we'll adopt kids.
Oliver, the problem's
more serious than that.
Jenny is very sick.
Define very sick.
She's dying.
That's impossible.
I'm sorry to
have to tell you this.
That's impossible.
Well,
it's a mistake.
It has to be.
We've repeated her
blood test three times.
There's no question
about the diagnosis.
She'll have to be
told soon.
We can withhold treatment
for a little while,
but not for long.
We'll have to
begin therapy
sometime during
the next few weeks.
She's only 24.
Will it be painful?
Hopefully not.
You'll of course
want to speak
to a hematologist.
I can refer you
to dr. Addison.
Yeah.
What do i do?
What can i do
for jenny?
Act as normal
as possible...
for as long
as possible.
That's really
the best thing.
Normal.
Normal.
O.k., i'll be
as normal as hell.
jen?
Jenny, i'm home.
hey,
i need a lawyer.
I'm a lawyer.
I need you.
I need you, too.
Why?
I'm not
a lawyer.
No, but you're
a nut,
and i happen
to need a nut.
You look lovely,
jenny.
Bullshit.
O.k., o.k.
you look terrible.
No, i do not
look terrible.
I never look
terrible.
I look o.k.
for thursday
evening, o.k.?
There's no poetry
in o.k.
screw poetry,
oliver.
Just tell me
what you see.
I see you.
That's poetry.
Hey,
dr. Shapeley
said we both
checked out.
That's what he told you, too, right?
Yeah.
So we just have to
keep trying, right?
Yeah.
Let's try now.
Right this
very minute?
Even sooner.
jenny?
Jenny! Jenny!
Get up,
you lazy preppie,
and get out
and support me
in the manner
to which
i plan to become
accustomed.
Come on. Get up.
you meeting stratton today?
Who?
Ray stratton,
your best friend.
Your roommate
before me.
yeah.
We're supposed to play,
but i think
i'll cancel it.
The hell you will.
Why not?
I don't want
a flabby husband.
Stay in shape,
please.
All right,
but i'll take you
to dinner.
Why?
Can't i take
my goddamn wife
out to dinner
if i want to?
O.k., barrett.
Who is she?
What's her name?
If you take
your wife to dinner
in the middle
of the week,
you must be
screwing somebody.
hey,
what's the matter, ollie?
Off day.
That's all.
You've been having
an off day
for two weeks now.
Old man jonas
wanted me to go
to chicago
on a big case.
Oh, yeah?
You know
that newscaster
that got beat up
by the cops?
You on
the other side
of a punch-out
rap.
I turned him down.
Why?
I don't know.
I just couldn't see
living in some hotel.
Boy, you're
really married.
Your time
will come.
hey, mrs. Barrett.
I'm in the kitchen,
where i belong.
Get the hell
in here, preppie.
Mrs. Barrett,
guess what.
You got fired.
I got fired up,
and guess where to.
Reno, nevada.
Paris, france.
We'll be there
christmas day.
No. That's not the way
we'll do it.
Do what?
I don't want paris.
I don't need paris.
I just want you.
Well, that
you've got, baby.
And i want time,
which you can't give me.
You saw
dr. Shapeley?
Mm-hmm.
And his buddy, too.
He's a very nice guy.
Who?
Dr. Addison.
He's a yalie--
college and med school,
but i said
you wouldn't mind.
No, not if he's
a nice guy.
He didn't bullshit me,
and that's what i wanted.
O.k., then, for
the yalie doctor.
O.k.
i'm counting on you
to be strong,
you goddamn
hockey jock.
I will, baby.
I will.
No. I mean for phil.
It's going to be
hardest on him.
You, after all,
you're going to be
the merry widower.
I won't be merry.
Yes, you will be.
I want you
to be merry.
You'll be merry,
o.k.?
O.k.
o.k.
enough?
Not for me.
I love watching you
dodge and weave.
The old hockey
fake-out.
That's you
all right--
the old hockey
fake-out.
Can we get a cup
of hot chocolate?
Sure.
I'll even pay.
Very gracious of you.
I told you
i liked it best
when i
supported you.
You always
supported me.
I mean, after all,
what's money?
I don't know.
Hey, could we
afford a taxi?
Sure.
Where do you
want to go?
The hospital.
She's getting white cells and platelets,
which,
at the moment,
is the most important thing she needs.
She doesn't want antimetabolites at all.
What does that mean?
That's a treatment
that slows
cell destruction,
but there are unpleasant side effects.
Jenny's the boss.
Whatever she wants.
You fellows do
everything you can
to make sure
it doesn't hurt.
You can be sure
of that.
I don't care
what it costs.
It could take
weeks and months.
Screw the cost.
There's no way
of knowing
how long
she'll linger.
I want her to have
the very best.
I'm wealthy.
I'm rich, really.
Really, i'm like
a millionaire.
How have you been,
oliver?
Fine, sir.
And how is jennifer?
She's fine, sir.
i need to borrow $5,000
for a very good
reason.
Well?
S-sir?
May i know
the reason?
I can't tell you.
Just lend me
the money, please.
Don't they pay you
at jonas and marsh?
Yes, sir.
And doesn't she
teach?
Don't call her
"she."
Doesn't jennifer
teach?
Leave her
out of this.
Just write out
a check.
It's a personal
matter--
a very important
personal matter.
You got some girl
in trouble?
Yeah. Yeah.
That's it.
Please lend me
the money.
thank you, father.
how is she?
She wants the troops
home for christmas.
Always running
the show.
She may succeed.
That fast?
Yes.
Hello, baby.
Phil.
How's it going,
mrs. B?
It's going, preppie.
The troops will be
home for christmas.
That's
a little trite.
It's
the goddamn truth.
Hey, watch your language.
There's
a grownup present.
I hope so.
I mean, phil made
a few promises.
Don't worry, jenny.
Maybe i ought to
let you guys--
i'll be nearby.
It doesn't hurt,
ollie.
Really, it doesn't.
It's like
falling off a cliff
in slow motion,
you know?
Only after a while,
you wish you'd hit
the ground, you know?
Yeah.
Bullshit. You never
fell off a cliff
in your whole life.
Yes, i did--
when i met you.
Yeah.
"What a falling off
was there."
Who said that?
I don't know--
shakespeare.
Yeah, but who?
I mean, what play?
I went to radcliffe.
I'm supposed to
remember those things.
I once knew all
the mozart kochel listings.
Big deal.
You bet it was.
What-what number
is the a-major concerto?
I don't know.
I'll look it up.
But i used to know
all those things.
I used to know
allthose things.
You want to talk music?
What do you want
to talk, funerals?
No, i don't.
Ollie?
I told phil
you could have
a catholic service
and you'd say o.k.
o.k.?
It will really
help him a lot.
You know?
O.k.
now you got to
stop being sick.
Me?
That guilty look
on your face--
it's sick.
Would you stop
blaming yourself,
you goddamn
stupid preppie?
It's nobody's fault.
It's not your fault.
That's
the only thing
i'm going to
ask you.
Otherwise, i know
you'll be o.k.
screw paris.
What?
Screw paris
and music
and all that stuff
you thought
you stole from me.
I don't care.
Don't you
believe that?
Then get the hell
out of here.
I don't want you at
my goddamn deathbed.
I believe you.
I really do.
That's better.
Would you please do
something for me, ollie?
Would you please
hold me?
No. I mean
really hold me--
next to me.
Philip.
I wish...
i wish i hadn't
promised jenny--
i wish i hadn't
promised jenny
to be strong for you.
oliver.
Why didn't you
tell me?
I made a couple
of calls,
and as soon
as i found out,
i jumped right
in the car.
Oliver,
i want to help.
Jenny's dead.
I'm sorry--
love--
love means never
having to say you're sorry.
