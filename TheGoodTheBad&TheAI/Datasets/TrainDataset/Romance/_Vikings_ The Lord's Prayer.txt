King horik:
Earl ragnar,
you seem to forget I am king.
Jarl borg:
Ragnar lothbrok
wants to be king.
His fame eclipses even yours.
I want my old position back.
I helped ragnar rise
and now he is earl.
Earl ragnar.
And our little world
waits upon him
And eats from his hand.
King horik understands the gods
There is something about him.
Ragnar:
You talk about trust.
You?!
Floki:
I am a trustworthy person.
I have a proposition
to put to you.
more,
give me more
give me more
if I had a heart
I could love you
if I had a voice
I would sing
after the night
when I wake up
I'll see
what tomorrow brings
I... I... I...
if I had a voice
I would sing
Helga:
Floki.
Floki, it's me.
Floki:
Helga!
Helga:
hey...
We have a child, helga.
Yes, we have a child.
Helga: A beautiful girl.
Floki: A girl!
You did not come,
so I brought her to see you.
A girl!
I don't want to drop her.
You won't drop her.
A girl...
A beautiful, beautiful girl.
How is it possible?
Take her back.
Take her back.
Helga:
What shall we call her,
hey?
Floki:
Angrboda.
The name of loki's
first wife?
Yes, yes.
But she's-
What's wrong with that?
They thought she was evil.
They had monstrous offspring.
She was a great giantess,
helga!
Will you come back with us?
Will you get to know
your daughter?
No. I have to stay
in kattegat.
But you,
you must go home.
Can't I stay awhile-
You don't understand, helga!
You have to leave!
Leave! Leave!
Little girl:
Over there!
Erlendur:
They're here, father!
Townsfolk:
Girl 3:
Hey! Erlendur!
Erlendur:
welcome!
Welcome to kattegat!
are you well?
King horik:
Come! Come, family!
I want you to meet ragnar. Huh?
Erlendur:
How was your travel today?
Are you hungry?
Man:
Welcome!
King horik:
Ragnar lothbrok,
my friend and ally,
And all your family gathered,
Let me properly present to you
my wife, gunnhild,
And my children.
On which the future
of our country
In this endeavor,
I see you more than ever
as an equal.
Between us -
and, of course earl ingstad -
We have land and opportunity
in wessex...
But that is only the beginning.
United even more
by the bonds of family -
For you have many sons
And, as you can see,
I have many daughters.
It is our custom to celebrate
such an alliance
As the gods celebrated theirs -
with feasting and with pledges.
Townsfolk:
torstein: Yeah!
Gunnhild:
You must be the famous
shield-maiden lagertha.
Lagertha:
Oh, you are more famous,
gunnhild.
The poets talk of your exploits.
They tell how you killed
swein forkbeard
When he invaded gotaland.
Gunnhild:
And they say that you are now
an earl in your own right!
How did it happen?
Lagertha:
I killed my husband
when he invaded me.
Gunnhild and lagertha:
King horik: What is it?
Floki: Don't you remember?
You were going to put
a proposition for me?
King horik:
Was I?
Floki:
Yes! And I am still waiting!
Horik:
The thing is, floki,
I'm not entirely sure
I can trust you.
Bjorn:
Porunn,
You are a free woman now.
What will you do
with your freedom?
I will use it to choose.
Bjorn: To choose what?
Porunn: You don't understand.
When I was a slave,
I loved you.
You were the first to treat me
as if I was not a slave.
But now, I have choices.
There are plenty
of other women here.
That is your first mistake.
Crowd:
Hey! Hey!
Up to your usual tricks
I see.
Torstein:
These two beautiful women
approached me.
They chose you for the size
of your silver pouch
And nothing else.
Torstein:
I don't think about it
too much.
If these women don't love me,
what do I care?
They will still make me happy.
Women:
King horik:
Siggy.
Siggy:
I am pleased to see you.
I would like to know your plans
while you are here.
King horik:
My wife is here,
and my children are here.
That's all you need to know.
Why did you come back,
priest?
Nobody wants you here.
You betrayed the gods!
You betrayed all of us.
It's your fault
rollo's going to die.
King horik:
Forgive me, floki.
I know I should trust you,
but I need proof.
Floki: Proof?
King horik: Yes.
Prove to me
I can trust you.
Prove to me
you are on my side.
How can I prove it?
Kill someone.
Someone who matters.
Bjorn:
Take your time, torstein.
floki: Yeah!
King horik:
Have you made up
your mind?
Yes.
I know who I will kill.
Bjorn:
Next summer, I say we should
return to wessex,
Claim our land
from king ecbert.
Those who wish to farm
should do so,
And divide the land
between them.
King horik:
What should the rest of us do,
hmm?
Those who do not wish
to be farmers.
Bjorn:
Those can join king ecbert
and princess kwenthrith
In the battle for mercia.
I am sure they will be
rewarded well.
King horik:
I agree with you.
I think we should claim
the land,
But I do not like the idea
of being ecbert's handmaiden.
I still have a score
to settle with him
And unlike ragnar,
I do not trust him.
Erlendur:
But isn't it best to test him
to see if he is honest?
Athelstan:
I believe he is telling
the truth.
Lagertha:
Then you are still innocent.
King horik:
So you agree with me?
Lagertha:
No. I agree that those
who wish to farm should do so
And also ask
for king ecbert's protection.
We will go elsewhere,
Explore and discover
new places.
Siggy:
Floki:
How is he?
Siggy:
He's alive.
Will he ever walk again?
Only the gods know.
Do you watch over him
day and night?
Listen. I'll stay with him
for a while.
Floki: You get some sleep.
Siggy: No, I-
Go get some sleep,
siggy.
You deserve it.
I will watch him.
Thank you.
Rollo:
You put me in a bed
like this once, rollo.
Do you remember?
I brought you something.
Look!
It's the food of the gods.
Eat!
Rollo:
Children:
Floki:
Ubbe!
Give this gift to torstein.
Say that they are
from his good friend floki.
Oh! And one more thing.
You must never tell anyone that
it was me who gave them to him.
That must be our secret.
Do you agree?
Good. Because if you don't
keep this secret,
Something terrible
will happen to you.
Do you know what will happen?
I'll tell you.
When the god loki had done
something terribly bad,
The other gods took him
to a nasty dark cave.
And there they chained him
on three sharp rocks,
And above him
they fastened a vile snake
So that its poison would
drip, drip, drip
Now, you wouldn't want that
to happen to you, would you?
Well, go and give my present
to torstein,
But keep the secret.
Bjorn:
My friend torstein
has been murdered.
I swear by all the gods,
Whoever did this
will pay a heavy price.
Floki:
We'll find the guilty one!
And we shall flay the skin
from his body
And use horses
to tear him apart!
King horik:
You did well.
Now I know I can trust you.
Floki:
So, what is your plan?
I will kill them all.
Floki: All?
King horik: Yes, all.
Floki: Ragnar?
Kong horik: Of course ragnar.
And lagertha,
and aslaug.
All of them.
All their bastard children.
I will wipe his family
from the face of the earth.
And bjorn?
What of bjorn?
Bjorn ironside.
He is difficult to kill.
Perhaps the gods
are protecting him.
You must find a way
to kill him.
I have no doubt
you will manage.
I know you will manage.
Floki:
When?
Tomorrow.
Be prepared,
my friend.
The gods are coming.
I know.
vendor: It's not goat;
it's mutton.
Vendor: Two more?
Man: Yeah, two more.
Bjorn:
Porunn.
forgive me for what I said.
I don't want other women;
I want you.
What do you want from me?
Porunn:
Respect.
Bjorn:
You know I respect you.
I worship you.
Porunn:
I don't want to be worshipped.
I spent my life as a slave.
Your words are ridiculous.
Bjorn:
What can I do?
You can fight me.
Fight you?
Yes.
Oww!
it's no use!
Don't give up.
Rollo:
What do you care
if I give up or not?
Do you want an honest answer?
I don't know.
But I think you might
still be useful somehow.
To whom?
Shouldn't you be
with your wife?
Doesn't she have need
of you?
King horik: Don't play games.
Siggy: There are no more games.
King horik:
Yes, there is,
and this is the final one.
You once promised you would
tell me ragnar's weaknesses.
I don't ever remember you
delivering on that promise.
Siggy:
Well, you wasted all your seed
on a promise.
King horik:
Tell me now.
Siggy:
Is it not obvious?
Ragnar's weakness
is his children.
Then this is what you must do.
You must go to the great hall
at sunset
And you must kill
ragnar's young sons.
What do I get in return?
I will marry you.
Gunnhild is my only wife
at the moment.
I will take a second.
I will make you a queen.
You will rule again,
as you once did.
Porunn: Ungh! Ungh!
Bjorn: Agh!
Bjorn:
What was that?
Bjorn:
Porunn! Please, stop.
Porunn:
Please what?
Porunn: Unnggghhh!
Bjorn: Agghhh!
Bjorn:  agghhh!
Porunn: Ungh!
Porunn:
Aggghhhhhhh!
ungh!
Porunn!
Porunn, I'm sorry!
It was an accident!
Porunn:
floki:
King horik:
This is the sword of kings.
This sword will belong to you.
Today we must do something
extraordinary.
We must overcome the magic
of ragnar lothbrok,
Which threatens our power
and survival.
The gods have spoken,
and I have listened.
We must cut and kill
in such a frenzy
None can survive.
For, believe me, if even one
of that family survives,
Then the day will come
when he will rise again
And destroy us.
Put yourself in the hands
of the gods,
Do their will.
And then, for certain,
they will grant you this sword,
And a kingdom.
Come.
Ragnar:
I've seen you praying
to your god.
Will you teach me
one of your prayers,
So I can learn?
Our father,
who art in heaven...
Our father,
who art in heaven...
Athelstan:
Hallowed be thy name.
siggy: Oh, boys, come.
Forever and ever,
amen.
Forever and ever...
Athelstan and ragnar:
Amen.
warrior: Ungh!
warrior 2: Agh!
warrior: Agh!
Warrior 3:
Agh!
Man:
Erlendur!
Athelstan:
And deliver us from evil.
Aghhhhh!
agh!
Agh!
Lagertha: Unngghhh!
Gunnhild: Agh!
lagertha: Agh!
Bjorn:
Floki, where have you been?
Looking after you,
bjorn...
Like I promised
your father.
You should leave now.
I have orders
from earl ragnar.
King horik:
Ragnar lothbrok!
ungh!
Warrior: Ungh!
Horik's man:
King horik:
Floki, you have betrayed
the gods.
No, king horik,
I was always true
to the gods.
And ragnar.
Ragnar, if you can find it
in your heart,
Spare my son.
Erlendur:
Lagertha: Ungh!
King horik:
Erlendur:
king horik:
Bjorn:
Go.
Aggghhhh!
