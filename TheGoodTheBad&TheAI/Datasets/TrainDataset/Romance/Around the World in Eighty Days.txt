Jules Verne wrote many books.
He was able to transfer
his soaring imagination to print.
His predictions were bold.
What he wrote was regarded
as fantastic fiction...
but much of it has become fact.
Flying machines,
submarines, television, rockets.
But not even his imagination
could shrink the earth...
to the point it has now reached.
He wrote a book called
.
And in Paris,
that authentic genius Georges Méliès...
turned it into a movie, 35 millimeter...
just as you're looking at it now.
It was, of course, fantasy.
But as of now,
no one has yet gone to the moon...
to see whether Méliès was right.
Here is the actual film
as Méliès' camera recorded it...
at the turn of the century.
will be determined
by the collective wisdom...
of the people who live
on this shrinking planet.
There was a time not so long ago
when learned men thought that was flat.
is the Jules Verne classic.
And the world was already shrinking
when it was written.
And that was in 1872.
Get your morning paper here.
All about the bank robbery here.
Paper, sir?
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Thorndyke.
- Hinshaw.
- Yes, sir.
Someone's been tampering
with my . The pages are crushed.
One of the members borrowed it
to read about the robbery.
You mean it's been used?
- Kindly remove it and send for a fresh one.
- At once, sir.
I'm a patient man, Hinshaw,
but don't trespass on my good feelings.
Pilbeam! Did you hear that?
- Some fellow stole that chap's paper.
- The devil you say!
Word of honor.
First time it's happened here,
to my knowledge, in 45 years.
The club's going to the dogs.
Next thing you know,
the members will be talking to each other!
- Yes, it's the thin end of the wedge.
- Oh, dog!
- Ice, my lord?
- Ice?
Certainly not.
What do I look like, a polar bear?
Sorry, sir. Several of the members use it
now and then.
Learned it from some Yankee, I dare say.
Those redskins over there drink anything.
A dangerous custom,
as I've always thought, sir.
A man might catch
a nasty chill on his liver.
Or break a tooth.
Remind me to speak
to the House committee about it.
No, by Gad! I'll write a letter to .
- I say, Hinshaw.
- Yes, Mr. Mockridge?
Must we have that confounded animal
around here, stamping its feet?
- Mind the horses!
- That bloke is barmy!
There's a sight!
Move over!
Move that confounded contraption!
When I placed you with Mr. Fogg
a fortnight ago...
I warned you that he was an eccentric.
An eccentric, Mr. Hesketh-Baggott?
The man's a tyrant.
A cold-hearted, implacable fiend.
Must I remind you that you are
speaking of a member of the Reform Club?
I don't care if he's member of the
Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.
The man's mad!
Actually, excessive sanity
is not a necessary qualification...
for that particular institution.
Believe me, sir, he is not human.
Do you know how many valets
he's had in six months?
Certainly I do.
I've supplied him with five of them myself.
And are you aware that he tortured them
with a refinement of cruelty...
which would have put Torquemada and
the entire Spanish Inquisition to shame!
He's as cold and methodical as those
two watches he carries about with him.
You are abandoning yourself to rhetoric.
Remember, you're being rigorously trained
as a gentleman's gentleman.
A gentleman's gentleman is one thing, sir.
A whimpering, cringing...
slave is another.
You are allowing
your native imperturbability...
to be swept away
by a spate of mounting hysteria.
- You really must calm down.
- I can't help it, sir.
If you knew how ardently
I have worked for Mr. Fogg...
how enthusiastically I have endeavored
to cater to his every whim.
His bath water had to be exactly
one foot, three and one-quarter inches.
No less, no more.
His morning toast had to be
- No more, no less.
- Extraordinary.
How does one take
the temperature of toast?
Incidentally...
have you found out
anything definite about him?
Who he is, what he does?
- Not the faintest indication, sir. Have you?
- Alas, no.
All I have discovered is entirely negative.
He is not a professional man,
and he isn't in trade.
He has no family connections
or background worth mentioning.
He doesn't go in
for hunting, or fishing, or wenching.
Cannot imagine how he ever got
into the Reform Club!
Perhaps your uncle the Bishop
might inquire for you.
- He is a member, is he not?
- One of the most distinguished, Foster.
We are a very ancient family, you know.
I was just rather curious
about our precious Mr. Fogg.
I suppose he'll be hectoring me soon
for someone to fill your place.
Thank you for your cooperation, Foster.
We must pray for guidance.
You have a nice little position
for a gentleman's gentleman, sir?
- For you?
- Yes, sir.
Never doubt for one instant, Foster...
the efficacy of prayer.
What is your name?
Passepartout.
I am from a very ancient family, sir.
Obviously.
You've had a rather speckled career, I see.
Professor of gymnastics...
- Yes, sir. Watch.
- No demonstrations, please.
Trapeze artist, fireman, chimney sweep.
- Amazing. How did you come to England?
- In a clothes basket, sir.
I escaped.
- From what?
- Women, sir.
A ladies' man?
There are no women in this household.
Now, my conditions are strict.
My timetable never varies.
When I say breakfast at 8:24...
- I do not mean at 8:23 or at 8:25.
- Yes, sir.
- Do you have a watch?
- Yes, sir.
It's probably wrong.
Very well. See that you behave yourself.
Any tomfoolery and out you go.
Come on, Ralph, don't be so secretive.
You're one of the governors of the bank.
Yes. Let's have some lurid details.
Nothing to tell.
You've read the newspapers.
They always exaggerate.
You mean to say the thief
actually got away with £55,000?
He did, in brand new bank notes.
Large denominations, £500 or £1,000 each.
How did you know?
We didn't disclose that to the press.
I assumed it.
£55,000 of small currency would have
needed a handcart to transport it.
It must have been compact enough
to stuff into one's pockets.
You're right. The man's audacity
staggers the imagination.
Imagine sauntering up
to the head cashier's table...
and pilfering a sum like that
from under his nose.
Serves you right, in a way.
Surely you have a better hiding place
for your funds than the cashier's nose.
Your persiflage does not amuse.
This has been an unexpected blow to us.
Unexpected, Mr. Ralph?
Bankers must expect robbery
the same way chickens expect hawks.
It's an occupational hazard.
My lead, I believe.
By the way, what was the head cashier
doing at the time?
He was writing a receipt
for the three-shilling deposit.
Go ahead and jeer. We'll lay the culprit
by the heels soon enough.
We've notified detectives
all over the world...
from Liverpool to Cairo.
We've issued descriptions throughout
Europe and America. He won't get far.
I wouldn't underestimate him
if I were you.
You're dealing
with a rather exceptional person.
Really? In what way?
Only a cool and logical man
could have engineered such an exploit.
Obviously a gentleman
with a considerable presence of mind.
You seem to know rather more
about this affair than the police.
Merely what one might deduce
from the facts.
Our trick.
If you ask me,
I'd say the odds were in favor of the thief.
If he's a resourceful chap, as Fogg says,
he'll find plenty of places to hide.
Yes. The world's
a pretty large affair, after all.
It was 100 years ago, not any longer.
A man can girdle the globe now
in three months.
Less than that, to be precise. In 80 days.
You mean a complete tour
all around the world in 80 days?
I mean just that.
- He's talking nonsense.
- No, Fogg may have a point there.
The Great Indian Peninsula Railway
was opened a fortnight ago.
That shortens the trip.
I read it in .
Hang .
I say it's impossible.
Nothing is impossible.
When science conquers the air it may
be feasible to circle the globe in 80 hours.
It's a beautiful dream,
but I'm talking about this moment...
and I say nobody
can go around the world in 80 days.
I agree.
Even if one made ideal connections
at every point...
there'd still be typhoons, shipwrecks,
unforeseen delays.
I include the unforeseen.
All very glib, Fogg,
but I'd like to see you do it in 80 days.
You're convinced that I could not?
So much so
that I'll wager £5,000 that you can't.
Let me understand you clearly.
Are you formally challenging me...
to undertake a journey
around the world in 80 days?
I am, and I'm prepared to back
my conviction by posting my check now.
Very well, I accept.
This is absurd. The joke's gone far enough.
An Englishman never jokes about a wager.
I have on deposit at Barings Bank
the sum of £20,000.
I'm willing to wager any or all of it
upon the same contention.
Namely, that I can complete
a tour of the world in 80 days.
That is to say,
in 1,920 hours or 115,200 minutes.
Would anyone besides Stuart
care to participate?
I'm no gambler,
but if you want to make foolhardy bets...
that you can't possibly win,
I'm afraid I'll be forced to take you on.
I'm with you.
So am I. What about you, Ralph?
My affiliation with the Bank of England
naturally precludes my betting...
but as a member of this club I might,
under very special circumstances.
Then it's agreed?
- We all accept?
- Yes.
Good. If I remember correctly,
the boat train for Dover...
leaves London Bridge station
at 8:45 tonight.
- I will be on it.
- Tonight?
Don't you need some days
to settle your affairs...
- to make preparations?
- No. I'm quite ready now.
You engage to be back here in London,
in the Reform Club...
on Saturday, September 21 at 8:45 p.m.
Right, gentlemen.
Clubs, I believe, are still trumps?
Shall we finish the game?
- Yes, please?
Yes, sir.
- I called you twice.
- I came as fast as possible, sir.
You are not supposed to be home yet, sir.
My usual routine is beside the point.
We leave for the Continent in 10 minutes.
-  is going traveling?
- Yes. Around the world.
Then you will not be here for breakfast.
Around the world?
Exactly. Now reassemble your faculties
and start packing.
Which clothes does ...
I mean, which trunks?
None whatever. Just take two shirts
and three pairs of hose for each of us.
- But I have only one shirt, sir.
- Then take that.
We'll buy whatever else we need en route.
Give me that red bag.
Open it up.
We're going to need plenty of money.
Whatever you do,
never let this out of your sight.
can trust me.
I will cherish it like a woman.
Don't make love to it. Just watch it.
Excuse me, sir. My cousin.
Excuse me, sir. It's not my cousin.
Thomas Cook and Son.
You purchase the tickets.
I'll be back in a moment.
All right, sir.
Now, , train to Marseilles...
steamer to Bombay via Suez,
across India by train...
and steamer again to Hong Kong.
Only one drawback.
With this route,
you miss Bali and the women.
But no, women of Bali
cannot be described.
- Please try.
- No, . Words would fail me.
In any case, in Yokohama,
you will encounter the geisha girls...
and those, ,
are not to be sneezed at.
I shall remember.
In Yokohama,
I must not sneeze at geisha girls.
Then, between San Francisco
and New York...
you will discover Indian maidens galore...
statuesque, barbaric creatures.
What a crime you have only 80 days.
However, first things first.
Here are your tickets to Marseilles.
Cancel those tickets.
They are of no further use to us.
We cannot go by train.
Has something happened? A wreck?
An avalanche has sealed
the Montfort tunnel...
and nothing can get through for a week.
Then the roads are blocked, too.
How can we go on?
I don't know. But I refuse to be daunted
at this stage of the game.
There must be another way.
There has to be.
But after all, we are not birds.
We cannot fly across the mountains.
That, , is not unfeasible,
fantastic as it seems.
Isn't she lovely?
I have made 63 ascents, gentlemen...
to an elevation over 1,000 meters.
I've flown through the skies
at a speed surpassing that of an eagle.
Are you quite sure
this is not just Gallic braggadocio?
You are now addressing the second
most-celebrated balloonist in Europe.
- And who is the first?
- He is not available.
He was buried last Tuesday.
Tell me, is this apparatus of yours
for lease?
If I operate it, yes.
If you do, it's only for sale.
- Passepartout, the bag.
- Yes, sir.
- We purchase your balloon, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
It's really very simple.
We empty out some sand...
and we go up.
Then we pull this...
and with any luck, we come down.
I imagine we release some gas
from the top of the balloon.
Gas! I forgot to turn off the gas
in my room.
No matter. It will continue to burn,
at your expense.
Gentlemen, I think this calls
for a restrained celebration.
Guess what's become
of the intrepid Mr. Fogg?
- What?
- He's drifting over the Alps in a balloon.
What's he doing in one of those?
Don't ask me, but it's here in this paper.
I say, he never mentioned
the word balloon.
Not very sporting, is it?
Rather sly, if you ask me.
I wouldn't have thought it of old Fogg.
I don't know,
seems quite resourceful to me.
English ingenuity, never say die,
all that sort of thing.
Does it happen to mention
over which Alps he's drifting?
No. I assumed they were the ones
in Switzerland.
Use your globe, sir.
Could be the Maritime Alps,
in the south of France.
In which case Fogg's not only
on schedule, but ahead of it.
We stand to lose £20,000.
What was that you said
about a celebration, Stuart?
If nobody wants this newspaper,
I'll just put it on the table.
The southern perimeter of France.
Often and with justification referred to
in the guidebooks as the "Azure Coast."
- The moment is propitious for our descent.
- Yes, sir.
The gas valve's stuck, I think.
Can you get up there?
I'll try it, master.
They're speaking some
bizarre foreign tongue.
- Do you understand them?
- Yes.
Ask them how far
we are from Marseilles...
and what conveyance
they have for us to proceed.
- Why aren't they speaking French?
- Because we are in Spain, master.
- Spain?
- Yes, sir.
It's a long trip to Marseilles.
But by sea, in a fast boat, 10 hours.
Where would we procure such a boat?
There is one vessel here.
The boat of Abdul Achmed of Tangiers.
Where would we find this worthy?
He sleeps by day.
But at night,
he's in the Cave of the Seven Winds.
- Think that's the man we're looking for?
- I think so, master.
Excuse me, master.
Good evening, sir.
It is forbidden to approach
his august personage.
Perhaps you would transmit a message?
I would like to engage his yacht
for a quick trip to Marseilles.
I will pay whatever he asks.
The ship is yours, sir.
Go where you wish without charge.
However, my master
is an aficionado of the bullfight.
That is why he visits here,
to see the festival of the bulls.
I do not understand.
He was most interested
in your servant's display of cape work.
He would like to see more tomorrow,
at the bullfight.
You mean he wants him to enter the ring?
But that will be a massacre!
Please, master. I'm not afraid. Let me try.
Don't push me.
It's the first time I've seen a real bull.
Look at the horns. It's not my size.
Try to be nice to me.
