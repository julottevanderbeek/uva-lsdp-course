I've got nothing to do with this.
You have to believe me.
We'd love to, Mr Stevens. But your
story really is rather... strange.
Listen. We were set up. It was staged.
- So you're saying you were framed?
That you are a victim?
- Well, no. Not exactly. Not like...
Not like who, Mr Stevens?
Not like her?
Not like this?
Did you question the others yet?
- Don't worry, we're on it.
So what you're saying is
it's all one big conspiracy?
Why don't you just make it
easy for yourself and confess?
Tell us again
what happened this morning.
Again?
- Again, Mr Stevens.
From the beginning,
if you don't mind...
Where were you this morning, Mr Stevens?
- At home.
My wife has taken the kids skiing.
- Not any more. She's on her way here.
She seemed to have
a lot of questions as well.
The phone woke you this morning.
What time was that?
It was about half past ten.
It was Luc. He was in a real panic.
I had to come over right away,
it was serious.
Luc Seynaeve?
- Luc, yes. Luc.
Where did you have to come over to?
- The loft. I had to come to the loft.
Did he say why he was in such a panic?
- No.
Did you know why he was in a panic?
- No. Not at the time.
Luc?
What's the matter?
Jesus Christ!
What the hell happened?
- I swear I really don't know, Vincent.
Did you have anything to do with this?
- Of course not. I found her like that.
Don't touch her. Wait for the police.
- Have you called the police?
Not yet, but...
- Let's not call the police yet, OK?
Jesus Christ, man!
Shit! Have you called the others?
- Marnix and Chris are on their way.
I couldn't get hold of Filip.
- Everyone needs to get over here, now.
Who is she? Do you know?
Do you know who that is?
- Of course not.
Where'd they break in?
Nowhere. The door was locked
and the alarm switched off.
No way!
- The door was locked and the alarm off!
No way. Cos that means...
- I know.
Someone must've used
one of our keys to get in.
Jesus, Luc.
What happened here?
Do you know the building on
Tavernierkaai, Mr Seynaeve?
Your good pal Vincent Stevens' project.
- Vincent's got lots of projects.
There's a loft on the top floor.
Does that ring any bells?
You've never been there?
- No.
Strange... We were told that
you share the loft with your friends.
In secret, without your wives knowing.
That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
Don't you sometimes
take someone up there?
Mistress, one-night stand, latest catch?
- That's just...
Five good pals who want some privacy
while they fool around.
No hotel or VISA bills
that your wife might find.
That's ridiculous.
- Don't play innocent.
One of your pals
has already confessed.
That surprises you, eh?
Don't you want to know who?
I don't do that kind of thing. I...
- You love your wife.
Yes. I love my wife. I do.
What happened to your eye, Mr Seynaeve?
- I walked into a cupboard.
Have you been in a fight?
- I walked into a cupboard.
Where were you this morning?
- I had breakfast in town with Chris.
I've got witnesses.
- Chris Van Outryve.
Dr Chris Van Outryve. The psychiatrist.
- One of your loft pals.
Chris is married, he has kids. He's not
the kind of guy to cheat on his wife.
Well, well, all regular family men.
Where is she?
- We've got a serious problem, Chris.
Jesus!
Filip...
- What did you say, Chris? Filip?
D'you think your brother's involved?
- I don't know...
We'll get the blame for this.
Elsie and the kids...
We've got to call the cops.
- Hold on, Chris.
You know what'll happen.
Or do you want Ellen to find out?
There's a body!
We've got no choice.
If Filip is involved, we're going
to have to report your brother.
He's the first one you thought of
too, eh? Remember last time?
Or have you already forgotten?
- No.
We're thinking the same thing,
aren't we, Chris?
We can help him. We're pals. If he tells
us what happened, maybe we can...
Maybe we can what?
Dump her body somewhere? You're crazy!
Listen, I'm not taking the fall
for his stupid mistakes, OK?
What the hell's going on?
Son of a bitch!
We've got a serious problem.
- Christ!
D'you know if Filip was here last night?
- I don't believe this!
What are you going to do?
I want to see her.
- Jesus Christ, man!
Don't touch her.
Don't touch her, Chris!
Who is it?
Who is it?
- I don't know.
None of us has got
anything to do with this, right?
Right?
- We'll find out what happened,
then deal with it.
We've gotta keep it quiet!
We're pals! OK?
Christ, they're letting anyone in!
- Hi, Vince. It's brilliant, man.
Long time no see, Ellen. You look great!
- Thank you, Vincent.
The design's brilliant. Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Hello, Barbara.
- Hello. Hello, Ellen.
Why don't you buy one of the apartments?
- Can't afford it.
Of course not. With your small salary.
You poor soul!
We'll catch each other later. OK?
One hour, then we're out of here. OK?
- We've onlyjust got here. Don't start!
Wow, man! Have you seen
all the good-looking chicks here?
Look, that black chick there...
Did you see that black chick?
- Take it easy!
She's so hot! I wouldn't mind hacking
my way through the jungle with her!
I'll even give her a head start!
- Calm down, Marnix. Miriam's watching.
Oops, I'm in trouble now!
- Well? Having fun, tubby?
Take it easy, pet.
We were just watching the guests.
Don't embarrass me,
or I'll leave you here by yourself!
Promises, promises, darling!
Luc. Isn't Elsie with you?
- She felt a bit dizzy.
She's gone to measure her sugar level.
- How's she doing?
Oh, here she is. How's things?
- I wasn't feeling too good
but I'm OK now.
- We can always go home, sweetie.
"Sweetie... "
She's just measured her sugar level!
D'you think that's funny?
At least he's concerned about her.
I wonder what you'd do
if that were me?
I'd be only too happy to stick a needle
in your bum every day, sweetie!
Can I ask you something?
You're a psychiatrist, right?
Yes, I am. Chris Van Outryve.
Dr Van Outryve, yes, that was it.
Do we know each other?
- No. You knew my sister.
You treated her. Sofie, Sofie Marai.
I'm very sorry
about what happened to your sister.
Some people are just born unhappy,
doctor. You must know that.
We'd been making good progress
in the weeks before.
But her last step forward wasn't
exactly a big success, was it?
Off the tenth floor.
Have you bought an apartment here?
- No, the architect's a friend of mine.
You?
- Me? No, no.
I came with the mayor. I work for him.
I'm his...
personal assistant, shall we say.
Oh. Interesting...
- No, not really.
I'm Ann, Ann Marai.
- I'm sorry about your sister.
No need to apologise.
You couldn't have saved her anyway.
I'm afraid it runs in the family.
You're not planning on
doing something stupid, are you?
It's all I ever do, doctor.
I'm always falling for the wrong men!
Everything's fine.
It's under control. Thanks.
Are you OK? Thanks, pal...
Filip.
- Hi, Vincenzo.
Not your first party tonight?
Sorry about my friend here!
I'll introduce you.
She works with me.
And she works under me.
Oh no, my brother's coming
over to lecture me!
Hello, Chris. How's things?
Friends of Vicky's?
Or are you just babysitting?
Hey, I'm still not married,
I can have a little fun!
It's not that I don't love Vicky. I do.
But that doesn't mean I hate other women.
I'm glad you came. I want to
show you something. Come with me.
Where are Marnix and Luc?
- I don't know.
Chris? Aren't you coming?
There.
What d'you think, guys?
- Fancy place!
Very nice.
What are you going to do with it?
It needs furnishing, but it's an oasis
of peace right in the city centre.
Your oasis still needs some work.
A place where nobody bothers you.
You can come here
whenever you want,
with whoever you want.
A place where you can...
how shall I put it? Steal time.
Steal time?
So, should I sell it?
- D'you want to keep it for yourself?
And a few friends, maybe.
- To do what?
The waiters don't come up here, eh?
I'm going back down.
Give me the key, so I can show
Filip's chicks your oasis!
Laureys! Stay here!
Those are decent girls!
D'you know how much they cost?
Why would we rent a loft here?
- No one needs to know what you do here.
But the idea that
you've got a secret place to go to...
Don't be stupid, you know what I mean.
- Yeah. But I'm not like that.
I don't think Luc is, either.
- Aren't we all a bit like that?
Or wouldn't we all like to be
a bit like that?
If you say so...
You can come here to read your paper,
if you like. For goodness sake...
I've gotta get out of here.
I can't stay here.
Luc. Where are you going? Luc? Luc!
You can't fall apart now.
Not now.
We've got to get through this together.
- Calm down.
We mustn't panic, mustn't lose our heads.
- It's over, Vince. Can't you see?
It'll all come out.
- No. We'll deal with it.
Come on!
This is Filip.
Leave a message after the beep.
Shit, man. What will we do if he
doesn't come? If he's run off?
Filip will come, he must come.
What if it's like last time?
We can't keep on covering up for him.
Guys, take a look at this!
What's this, guys?
What does it mean?
Chris, what does it mean?
Do you know Latin, doctor?
- Pardon?
Do you know Latin?
Yes, I know Latin. Sorry...
Then maybe you can tell us
what's written on the wall?
Fatum nos iungebit.
I can read.
But what does it mean?
Fatum nos iungebit,
fate will link us.
Fate. Or death, if you like.
Written in her blood.
Our investigations revealed that the
victim is unlikely to know Latin.
So it's quite possible
someone else wrote that.
But using her finger.
Someone who does
know Latin, doctor.
Fatum nos iungebit is wrong.
- What do you mean, wrong?
The imperfect future of
the verb to join, iungere,
isn't iungebit, it's iunget.
It should say fatum nos iunget.
Whoever you're looking for
made a classic mistake in Latin.
But you probably already knew that.
Do you know the expression 'fuck you'?
It's not Latin,
but I'm sure you understand it!
Where's your brother, doctor?
Everyone else is here except him.
We can't get hold of him.
I'm sorry, I've no idea where he is.
He's your half-brother, isn't he?
Same mother, different father?
He and his sister have been
in various children's homes.
They went into care
after our mother died.
Filip wasn't so lucky with his father.
- Obviously.
A serious alcoholic.
He hit his children.
You didn't see much of your brother.
Now you're best friends.
Yeah. We've got a lot of lost time
to make up for.
What's that? "Fate will link us. "
Is that meant for us, Chris?
Is that meant for us?
Where the fucking hell is Filip?
Everyone else is here.
- How should I know where he is?
What the fuck is that?
That's from here.
That's a knife from here.
Christ, they'll be blaming us for this!
Where the fuck is Filip?
- Where d'you think?
Can someone tell me what's going on?
Bastard! Sadist!
- What's the matter?
Stop it!
Now is not the time.
Touch me one more time and
you'll be lying there next to her!
Have you got anything to do with this?
- Why would I have?
We'll help if you need a good lawyer.
- But I don't need a lawyer...
Take it easy, Filip.
Were you here last night?
- No, I wasn't here last night.
I was at my parents-in-law's.
Call Vicky and check.
Why did it take so long to get here?
I was at a building site
with my father-in-law.
I couldn't just leave. Great to hear
this voice whingeing in your voicemail,
"There's a body in the loft. "
- I don't get it.
And where were you? Before you accuse
everyone else. Where were you?
I was at home last night.
- Any witnesses?
Don't you believe me? No, no witnesses.
Barbara's in Les Arcs with the kids.
If anyone here has got anything
to do with this, he should say so now!
Now's the time! Now!
Thank you, they're lovely.
Filip finally got hitched.
I'll drink to that!
Which one's his father-in-law?
- Him over there.
Ludwig Tyberghein, Mr Concrete.
- Building projects round the world.
Filthy rich and
she's an only child.
Filip is home and dry!
- Let's hope he'll be happy.
She looks like a decent girl, Chris.
Well, well. Look who's here.
Tyberghein's been on a building spree
here since Van Esbroeck became mayor.
Wasn't Van Esbroeck at your opening?
- Yeah, just to show his fancy face.
If it's anything lucrative,
they prefer their own architects.
Oh, so the big boys won't let you play?
They're so mean!
That's not fair.
You draw such nice little houses...
Hey, my nice suit!
Nice, eh? Don't you think?
A fancy wedding like this.
They say money doesn't bring happiness
but that's just to fool the poor.
Isn't it?
Well, guys, you've lost him now.
He's all mine now.
Congratulations, Vicky.
He's a real character!
You do realise that?
- Yes, but I'll tame him.
Right, darling?
- Yeah.
The birdie's in a cage
and I've got the key.
But it is a gold cage, pal!
Can I tell them?
- Yes, of course. Go on.
Filip's going to start working
for my dad next month.
No more lying in the sack all morning,
eh pal?
Gotta go sell houses with daddy!
- I'll get you thrown out!
My security guys will kick your ass!
Come on, let's go and open
some more envelopes.
I'm gonna stay here with my friends.
- OK. Bye.
I've seen enough fancy folk for now!
Filip...
Here's my present.
- Are you serious?
Take good care of it,
there are only five of them.
Accepting the key means
you accept the rules of the loft, guys.
Our wives are here, you idiot!
- The loft is finished. Go and see.
It's a gift from me to all of you.
But you're not like that, right?
If not for now, maybe for later.
Who knows what life holds?
Luc? You?
Just make sure
it doesn't blow up in your face.
Wow, guys, our own loft!
- Just gotta find someone to take there!
There's plenty of choice right here.
Those rich folks attract great pussy!
Look at that young chick there.
With black hair, in a green dress.
I'll gladly show her my etchings.
- She's about 17!
She's 18. Keep your hands off her
or you'll regret it!
What? You and her?
- That's Sharon.
Is that Sharon? Skin-and-bones Sharon?
- Yes, that's Sharon.
Is that your little sister?
Wow, she's grown into a real beauty!
Two more summers
and she's ripe for picking!
Although I reckon she's ripe now!
- Marnix! That's enough!
What?
- That's enough.
But pals share their goodies...
I'm thirsty.
Are we gonna have another drink?
A beer.
- A beer.
Don't talk about my sister like that!
- OK.
I mean it. If you ever lay a finger
on her, you're dead! Got it, pal?
Yes, Filip, OK.
I was just joking, man. You're crazy!
Hello, Chris.
- Hello.
I don't know if you remember,
but we met at a gallery opening.
Yes, I know. Ann Marai.
- So you do remember me. That's nice.
I see you work weekends too.
The mayor should be pleased.
The mayor can get stuffed.
I think you're a bit more
than just his assistant.
What do you mean, Mr Psychiatrist?
Have you noticed something?
You don't look very happy.
- Right.
I imagine it's not much fun always
being left on your own at parties.
Later, when you're alone with him,
you'll have all his attention again.
But you're gradually realising that
you'll always be his mistress.
He says
he's going to leave his wife for me.
Is that what he says?
How long has he been saying it?
I told you.
I always fall for the wrong men.
Shall I tell you something?
A little secret, between you and me?
D'you know
what turns our respectable mayor on?
He just loves having my panties
in his pocket at events like this.
That turns him on, seeing me and knowing
I'm not wearing anything under my dress.
Jeez, I don't understand
why you let him treat you like that.
Who says I let him treat me like that?
Maybe it turns me on too.
Maybe telling you is turning me on.
Make sure you don't catch cold.
Chris, sorry...
I don't know why I said that.
Maybe I was testing you or something.
- I don't need to be tested.
Could I talk to you?
Over a cup of coffee. Some place where
we won't be disturbed. Please?
Vincent, that key. I want to use it.
Not for what you think.
I'll give it back as soon as I can.
It's never for what I think, Chris.
Have fun.
Wait. Has everyone still got their key?
- Of course everyone has.
Seriously, let's think logically.
Five keys were made.
You need a code to have another made.
It's in my safe, so we can forget that.
No one's broken in. So just to make
sure. Has everyone still got their key?
D'you think we give our keys to people?
That's against the rules.
Your rules, Vince.
Can everyone get out their key?
- What's the point of that?
A key may've been lost.
Then we can rule that out.
Here. Here's mine.
Where's your key, Chris?
You didn't use your key to get in.
- I haven't got my key with me.
Where is it, Chris?
- I haven't got it on me, OK?
I don't use it every day.
- It's not lost?
It doesn't matter whether
I've got my key with me now or not.
We've only got four.
Where's the fifth?
Christ, Chris,
someone must've used a key to get in.
Oh yeah? How d'you explain
the alarm being switched off?
Whoever got in here
also knew the code to the alarm.
Unless... she let him in, of course.
- And how did she get in then?
Whichever way you look at it,
it always comes back to us.
I'd really like to know which one of us
is hiding something here.
What did you say it's called?
- Polyamory.
Multipartnered relationships.
- And your boss is into that?
He's got a wife and a girlfriend
and they know about each other.
He says he loves his wife and he loves
his girlfriend, why should he choose?
And his wife doesn't mind?
What a silly cow!
Sounds like something for us, eh boys?
'Polly-maria'...
Hey, tubby. You can't cope with one
woman, how would you cope with two?
You could look a bit enthusiastic.
- It's your party.
Anyway, I've got to cook.
- Don't be like this.
If you have to invite
your friends round, Chris,
at least be home on time.
- I had to stay at work a bit longer.
What do I have to do
to get some attention?
Get myself admitted to your hospital?
It's not like they're always here!
Come and join us. Do it for me.
I hope tubby doesn't throw up
all over the lounge!
He's drinking whisky like it's water.
Can't his wife see?
Polyamory may be fine, but his wife
eventually had someone catch him at it
and threw him out.
- Your boss is a real sap.
He should've kept his trap shut and
organised things better, eh Vince?
What happened in the end?
He now lives in a tiny flat
with the woman of his dreams.
She's 22, blonde and has false breasts.
Typical...
Why do men like fake breasts?
Women! Always whining about fake tits!
If they look good, they look good.
My mom's got false teeth.
When she laughs, are you gonna say,
"Oh dear, they're false!"
No, people will say that they look good.
You look better than you did.
It's an improvement.
It's always the same with women,
they're always jealous!
Marnix...
- Nothing beats a beautiful chick!
This is a little too high-brow for me...
My IQ's too low for profound philosophy.
- Maybe you should have it enlarged?
And get the corners of your mouth
lifted, so you can smile for once.
Well, Miriam,
I really admire your choice in men.
No, d'you know what? That guy
should've organised things better.
That would've been better.
You've gotta be organised, right?
OK then,
how would you organise things?
You have to find some place
where they can't catch you.
That is the key to... that is the key
to time... to stealing time.
Sounds like you've already given it
some thought. Any more strange ideas?
Hey, Vince, Vincey boy.
Stop talking drivel, pal.
Click-click, the key, there's the trick.
The key to the...
Marnix!
Let's go and get some fresh air.
It'll do you good.
Sorry. Sorry, boys.
Don't worry about it. He gets
like this when he's been drinking.
Why haven't I got
someone like you for a husband?
Oops, sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
I felt a bit queasy after that starter.
Thai food...
It's spicy. Can be hard on your nose...
- Yeah, exactly.
We need some more insulin,
this is almost gone.
Luc, is there something
you should tell me?
What should I tell you?
- Are you keeping secrets from me?
Of course not.
- Are you in love with someone else?
You can tell me.
- Why are you asking strange questions?
No, I'm not cheating on you.
- That wasn't what I asked.
I asked if you were in love
with someone else...
Elsie, I may not be as exciting as the
rest but I will always be there for you.
Always. For you and the children.
I don't know
what I would do without you, Luc.
There's a lot I could put up with...
What are you doing?
- We've got to get rid of her.
We can't, Vince.
The handcuffs won't fuckin' open!
Can't you see what's going on?
Someone's trying to set us up!
Who'd want to do that?
- Think. A handcuffed body.
The Latin, the knife,
all in our loft.
Who else knows about our arrangement?
Has anyone ever given the game away?
You, Marnix?
- What? Why me?
Because you were totally hammered maybe?
- No!
I've always kept to the rules.
- Did you reveal the code to the alarm?
Or enter it with someone watching?
- No!
Why are you looking at me?
- What are you trying to say?
Maybe someone wants revenge,
wants it all to come out?
Who'd want revenge?
I don't know. A jealous boyfriend,
a rejected mistress, someone like that.
Is anyone of us in trouble?
I think you're sweet.
- Uh-oh, that sounds like "pathetic".
No.
You're one of the good ones.
That's a strange thing to say,
given the circumstances.
I don't know.
Who does this loft belong to?
- A friend.
He's abroad.
- He seems to have been abroad for ages.
I love you, Ann.
You shouldn't say
something like that to me, Chris.
I mean it.
- Yes. And why?
Because you feel you have to say it?
I don't cheat on my wife or
fall in love at the drop of a hat.
I don't want you to be in love with me.
Our rendezvous are exciting.
But real life's not like that.
- I'd like to give it a try.
If you don't shut up,
I'll say something mean.
I'm fed up with all the lies,
all the secrecy.
I want to tell Ellen everything.
And... I'm going to leave her.
You can only be hurt
by people you love.
I'll never hurt you, Ann.
I'm not talking about you.
You don't know me.
Give me the chance to get to know you.
- I'm a whore, Chris! OK?
I sleep with men for money.
That's what I am, a whore!
What did you say?
- Don't worry, doctor.
I won't be sending you a bill
for the past few months.
What did you say?
- Forget it. You don't know half of it.
Is Chris cheating on his wife?
- Eh, I don't think so, officer.
Chris is a devoted husband...
- All your friends are real family men!
You should all open a fuckin' shop!
But you've done a few things
you shouldn't, eh pal?
Why does your wife want a divorce?
I don't know about a divorce...
We've just separated for a while.
Why?
- My wife found something out
that she wasn't very pleased about.
- You cheated on her.
Technically speaking... yes.
And how did she find out?
- The woman that I...
That you cheated on her with.
- Yes. Her.
She'd obviously expected more
and turned up at our place.
The stupid...
The lady in question started
telling my wife all about it...
I hope my wife will forgive me
for my mistake, because I love her.
Cheating is fun, but
getting caught is a bitch, right?
Did you take the woman to the loft?
- No, no, it happened in Düsseldorf.
In Düsseldorf?
- What were you doing there?
There was a trade fair there.
Vince had some VIP tickets
and two were going spare. A couple of
nights at a fancy hotel, away from home.
You were one of the lucky recipients.
- I was one of the lucky recipients...
You don't dare!
She keeps looking at you, man!
Invite her over. You can have her,
I'll have the leftovers.
In your dreams!
- I'm not interested in those girls.
Why not? They're begging for it!
Far too easy!
- Come on, Vince!
I prefer women who are worth the effort,
who are special.
I like discovering unknown islands.
- Look over there.
A whole group of islands!
An atoll, Luc!
Vince, does Barbara know about
these 'discovery trips' of yours?
Why would I want to hurt her with that?
- Hey, take it easy, man.
You've got a key to the loft.
What d'you do there? The washing up?
Well! More Belgians in the hotel!
My name's Anja. I'm waiting for
a colleague from work.
It's expensive here, isn't it?
- Can we buy you a drink?
That'd be nice of you. Can I have
something other than a beer?
What are you drinking?
Is that champagne?
She'll scare off
all the good-looking girls, man!
A glass of champagne.
Ugly girls always have pretty friends.
- What if she's the prettiest one?
Look, look! I don't believe it,
Mr Concrete is here too.
And he's not here with
Mrs Concrete, either.
All guys are the same!
- What wisdom, Anja! I'll drink to that.
You're a weird guy, you know that?
A bottle of champagne, please, and
four glasses for that table over there.
Weren't you at Vicky's wedding?
Filip's friends?
The architect?
- Vincent Stevens.
I designed...
- I've heard of you.
Maybe we should get together.
I can always use an architect.
Great, Mr Tyberghein.
- We've got a big project
in Antwerp, Left Bank.
Apartment blocks, luxury apartments.
Very trendy and all that crap.
It may be right up your street.
But it's still all very hush-hush.
I hope you can be discreet.
It would be a challenge...
- Discretion, Mr Stevens.
That's something I insist on.
Dictum sapienti sat est.
A word to the wise is enough.
Are you a good listener?
- Definitely... definitely.
I'm in software
and I can also be very discreet.
Put everything these people drink
on my bill.
Enjoy the rest of your evening,
gentlemen.
Thank you.
Miss...
Who does that bastard think he is?
Dictum sapienti, my ass!
There, look. Someone else
on a discovery trip!
That's the mayor's whore, Marnix.
Hello, this is Ann Marai.
Messages after the beep.
Who are you calling
at this late hour?
No one. Just listening
to my voicemail. Why?
Listening to your voicemail.
What did it say?
"You're a poor liar, Chris Van Outryve?"
Why d'you say that? Is something up?
- I don't know.
Perhaps that's
what I should be asking you!
Ellen, I...
- I'm going to bed.
Can you turn the lights off?
- Ellen!
Guys' brains are between their legs!
Yeah? There are two things
in women's magazines.
What pigs men are
and how to seduce them.
But why take on a whole pig,
when you only need a tiny bit of one?
Can't leave you alone for five minutes!
- Five minutes?
Sarah, sweetheart, I've been
waiting here for you for an hour!
Fortunately for me,
I found some sponsors!
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your new friends?
Was that the first time you met her?
- Yes, that was the first time.
Sarah Delporte.
- Yes, Sarah.
What happened in Düsseldorf?
What do you want to know?
- Everything.
If they catch us, they'll throw us out.
- You're terrible, Sarah!
You shouldn't have dared me!
There, the swimming pool.
- Shall we go back, Vincent?
Before something happens we'll regret.
- Come on, Luc.
This is really exciting, eh?
- A bit too exciting for me.
Come on, Vincent. Take your clothes off.
You wanted to swim in the nude.
We had a bet, now I want my prize.
My scampi are about to reappear.
What? You haven't seen anything yet.
You're serious?
There.
- What d'you mean, there?
More?
- Yes, more.
Yeah... not bad... for such an old guy!
You like playing games.
- Who's playing games here?
You dared me, so we'd end up here
which is what you wanted all along...
- As if I would...
Come on, your turn. Come on.
Luc, is it still too exciting
or do you feel more relaxed now?
Nice, isn't it?
- Lovely.
Aren't you coming in, Luc?
- I'm fine here.
But I need you, Luc,
because Vincent's going
to try to hit on me
and if you're there, he may not dare.
You're a cheeky minx!
- It's not true, then?
You've been paying me compliments
all evening
and that naughty way you look at me.
Do that look again.
That eye contact that lasts
a bit too long. No, really.
You're very good, Vincent.
- I think so too.
Did you think
I'd given you the go-ahead?
Sorry, Vincent, you disappoint me.
- You really like playing games!
I'll tell you something.
I'm better at it than you are.
Can you feel me?
- Yes.
Marnix? Are you here? Marnix?
I want the key to our room, pal.
Marnix.
- Leave us alone for a bit, Luc.
You're scared. You're running away
from your feelings, aren't you?
I don't want to say goodbye.
I'm sorry it has to
end this way, Sarah...
Are you actually capable
of loving someone?
I'm sorry.
Why are you throwing that away?
- Because it's empty.
You were here last night,
weren't you, pal?
If you were here last night, why don't
you say so? We're your friends.
She was here when I left.
She was still alive then.
Someone came round after I left.
Well, say so then. You're just making
the whole thing worse.
We should go to the police.
We can't sort this out.
- Are you crazy? What do we say?
And to our wives?
Vince has got something to tell you.
- What do you want to tell us, Vincent?
What the fuck?
Go on, answer it.
Hello?
Who is it?
A real estate agent
to see the loft.
The loft is up for sale.
- What?
See, I was right! Fuckin' hell!
How can it be for sale, Chris?
- She's come to see a Sarah Delporte.
Who is Sarah Delporte?
Who is she, guys?
And who put this place up for sale?
She did, or what?
You know her, Marnix.
- What? What are you saying?
That you know her.
So does Luc.
That's Sarah Delporte there.
I swear I've never seen her before.
- You're lying. You do know her.
Why d'you say that?
- We met her in Düsseldorf.
A couple of months ago,
that last evening in the bar.
She was Anja's friend.
Come on!
I was totally pissed, I don't remember.
- I know, Marnix.
But you weren't, eh Luc?
- Is that her?
Goddammit!
Don't be stupid, Luc. You spoke to her.
- How am I supposed to know it's her?
I don't know who that is. You turned
her over, you saw her. I didn't.
Do you know her or not, Luc?
- When you see a body,
you're not gonna think of a girl
you met one evening in a hotel bar.
He's twisting the facts,
that's what he's doing. Don't you see?
You've made a mistake, madam. We don't
know anyone called Sarah Delporte.
Come on, Filip.
Do you know her?
- I can't see, dammit!
Who's that?
Was that what you wanted
to tell us, Vincent?
We were seeing each other, OK?
I brought her here a couple of times.
But I swear on my children's lives,
I've got nothing to do with this.
On your children's lives?
Jesus Christ, man!
Were you here with her last night?
Did you bring her here?
I don't want to say goodbye.
I finished it last night.
Vincent...
She was alive when I left her,
Chris, I swear... Anyway, so what?
That still doesn't explain why someone
here put our loft up for sale!
Are you looking for something
in particular orjust browsing, sir?
Why don't you return my calls?
If you're dumping me,
at least have the guts to tell me.
How can I dump you, Chris? There's
nothing going on between you and me...
Oh, is that what it was? Nothing? OK...
Let's not make this difficult.
You know what I am.
It doesn't matter who or what you are.
It really doesn't, Ann.
How many women
have you taken to that loft of yours?
That loft you share with your friends.
Save your whinging for the next chick
you take there.
Wait! Ann, you know I'm not like that.
You know I'm not.
I've known better liars than you.
- Hold on.
Here. I only need this
if we're gonna go there together.
Keep it.
If you want to see me, let me know.
Chris? What are you doing here?
Are you looking for something for Ellen?
Hi, Elsie.
No, I was here with a colleague.
Does your wife know you share a loft?
- I told you, I don't.
I may have been there once,
when the building opened.
So you have been there! Just now
you said you didn't know where it was.
I've never taken anyone there.
I thought that was what you meant.
Did you know the girl?
- I met her in Düsseldorf.
Did you know he started seeing her then?
- I'd be very surprised if he did.
D'you get jealous when your good friend
Vincent hits on good-looking women?
I'm married. I'm not jealous of him.
I don't mean of him, Mr Seynaeve.
I mean jealous of the women.
What are you saying?
What are you implying?
You've got a nerve,
insinuating that kind of thing!
Why so fierce, Mr Seynaeve?
- Vincent's my best friend,
always has been.
- Your best friend has betrayed you all.
Vincent would never betray his friends.
You're just saying that.
You bastard!
What was that?
- You heard, you bastard!
You accuse me yet hide stuff from us!
Last night I told her our relationship
was over and then I left.
And that's it, man.
- That's it?
You seem to have put
a definite stop to it!
When were you planning
on telling us, Vince?
Put that knife down, Filip.
Don't be stupid!
I don't know what happened after that.
I've got nothing to do with it!
- Let him be.
Maybe I wasn't the only one.
Maybe she was seeing someone else too.
Someone who's trying to pin it on us.
- On you, you jerk!
It looks like
it's your problem now, Vincent.
Can't you see what's happening?
Why see a real estate agent
about a loft that's not hers?
On the day she's found dead in it.
What a coincidence!
Why would she do that?
We can't carry on, guys.
It's all coming out.
So what are you going to do?
Leave me to deal with it on my own?
Vincent? Are you there?
Vince? Open the door, please.
Are you crazy? I'm here with someone.
- Miriam's gone!
What d'you mean, Miriam's gone?
- She's left me.
That girl from Düsseldorf
told her what happened.
You have to help me.
- Does she know about the loft?
What? No. Of course not.
It all happened in Düsseldorf.
You were there, at the pool.
Miriam's gone, Vince.
What do I do now?
I can't live without her.
- You haven't admitted anything?
Rule 1, never admit anything. You hurt
them when you do. They don't understand.
Can't you go and
have a word with her, Vince?
Can't you tell her that I love her,
that that Anja is lying?
She'll believe you, Vince.
- I'll try, OK.
It'll be OK.
- I love her, Vince.
I'll see it's all straightened out.
Shit, I just hope that's all she knows.
Look at what you've got us into.
- Sorry, that wasn't the idea.
Now what?
- We've got to get her out of here.
Remove all traces of what's happened.
We can't just make her disappear.
- It's the only way to get out of this.
Listen to you!
You had a relationship with her
and now she's just evidence
that may ruin your perfect life.
What kind of person are you?
- I don't need lessons from you!
How are you gonna get her off the bed?
Saw her hand off?
Or have you got the keys to the cuffs?
- No, I haven't.
I thought handcuffs
were more your department!
What's that supposed to mean?
- You know very well what I mean.
Help me!
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up!
The slut thinks she can jerk me around!
Help me! Please.
- Shut up!
He's crazy!
He raped me! He raped me!
- It's OK.
Give me the key.
- The bitch wanted to call the cops!
The key!
- The key? Here's the key.
Here's the key.
I didn't want to do things.
He made me do things...
- Shut up!
What? Do you want more money? Eh?
Is that it? Here's your fucking money!
Are you mad?
Have you lost your mind?
She's a whore! D'you know
what it is about whores? D'you know?
You can't rape them! You can't.
Fuck!
- You don't treat a woman like that!
Not any woman!
What is it with you?
- Get off me!
Keep your hands off me!
Just fuckin' look at you!
You're high on coke
and beating women up.
Don't you realise you're putting us
all in danger? D'you realise that?
I want the police.
He hit me. He raped me.
Keep your trap shut
or I'll shut it for you!
You're no fuckin' better
than your old man!
Oh, Chris!
Yeah, Chris was luckier with his daddy!
You, who always wants to help the whole
world, who wants to save everyone.
Where were you
when we were being beaten up?
And our mother pretended
she couldn't hear it.
Safe in your student digs!
- Jesus!
You were never bothered about us.
Never. I had to protect my sister.
We meant nothing to you.
We meant nothing to you, nothing.
- I didn't know.
If I had known...
- What?
What? I'd have taken you
away from there, dammit!
I'm terribly sorry
but we cannot go to the police.
I'll take you to a friend of mine,
he's a doctor.
Vincent, give me
all the money you've got on you.
This is about 700 euros. It's not enough
for what happened to you today
but maybe it makes it easier to forget.
No, he's an animal.
He should be locked up!
I want the police.
- We'll deal with him. I promise.
Wait. Take this. It's worth
a lot of money. Take it. Take it.
See, that's what she wanted... money.
I'll tear you apart
if you don't shut up!
Come on, get your clothes,
we'll go to a doctor.
I don't need your doctor.
You made me do something today
that I'll never forgive you for. Never.
I'll pay you back for the watch.
What's the problem?
Fuck me!
Why didn't we know about this?
When did this happen?
- Two weeks ago.
We agreed to keep it to ourselves.
Because that's what friends do.
- I don't need lessons from you.
Not about friendship.
- But it's why I kept quiet.
I thought this was your doing.
You'd got here
pissed, stoned, worked up...
- Kiss my ass!
It's time you gave up snorting coke!
- It's time you gave up the booze!
That's enough! Just listen to you!
They want to set us against each other!
Someone's trying to destroy us!
There's something I have to tell you
too. Can someone restrain Filip first?
Filip...
- You had that coming, pal.
What are you saying, Luc?
You asked us to be honest,
to put all our cards on the table.
I'm putting all my cards on the table.
- So where are they, Luc?
And where did you do it?
I don't believe this! Fuckin' hell!
Fuckin' hell, Luc!
So you record everything that happens
here, every woman we bring here.
Not always... Sometimes.
- Oh. When is sometimes?
When you like what's on?
- At least I'm not cheating on my wife.
No, you just watch.
- You're sick, you are!
You're sick! You raped a prostitute,
not me. I've got it on DVD!
You're sick.
- Filip, we're in this together.
Remember what we said.
- Where are these recordings, Luc? Here?
I want you to destroy all the DVDs.
The whole lot. Together with us.
Or I swear, I couldn't give a shit
whether this all comes out or not!
So you recorded what happened yesterday.
- No, you didn't say you'd be here.
You broke your own rules. You're
good at that, breaking your own rules.
Now you're scared. Scared I've got DVDs
of everything you've been up to here.
But don't worry, Vince,
I'm your friend.
Your best friend... I'll keep quiet.
I always keep quiet.
I've always known you were a sleazebag!
- Jerk!
You got your rocks off watching us!
- You know nothing about me! Nothing!
Zip!
Did you see anything that could help us?
D'you know what happened?
When people, who are being
cheated on and hurt, find each other,
what do you think happens?
What do you mean?
- What do you think?
What's up, mousey?
- I don't feel like going tomorrow.
What? Don't you want to go skiing?
- Yes, but I don't want to go on my own.
But you're not. The kids are going too.
- You know what I mean.
Can't you come too, darling?
I love you. The rest is irrelevant.
What d'you mean, the rest is irrelevant?
- Everything that's not important.
I'll call you every day.
I promise.
I know. One hour, no longer.
- Do what you want. Don't mind me.
I enjoy every moment
that we are still together.
Have you ever thought what you'd be
losing if you chose the unknown?
Well, well, if it's for charity,
Mrs Concrete's allowed to come too.
Did you hear anything about
that Left Bank project?
I heard they got building permission.
- They didn't call back.
I'm not important enough
for the big boys.
But they don't know me yet.
Ladies...
- This is Vincent Stevens, an architect.
He did the building on Tavernierkaai.
- Oh, was that you?
The design is fantastic, it's wonderful.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
I was talking to your husband about it
in Düsseldorf.
It's a shame you weren't there
in Düsseldorf...
You told me about
your Left Bank project, Mr Tyberghein.
You were going to call me about it.
We're working on it.
We've applied for building permission...
We're just waiting and hoping.
- Fantastic!
Are you a gambling man, Mr Mayor?
- Do you like taking risks, Mr Stevens?
Depends on the stake and
what the others have got to lose.
How did you put it?
Dictum sapienti sat est? Was thatit?
Ladies, let me wish you
good luck at the tables.
You're obviously already
lucky in love!
Gentlemen...
Make sure you save some for
my alimony, tubby. Don't lose it all.
What are you doing here, Miriam?
- Can't I go out for a change?
Please, I really want to come back.
I did something stupid.
I know that. I was drunk.
It didn't mean anything.
- I don't understand that about guys.
If it doesn't mean anything, why do it?
That's not very nice for the girls.
I swear I'll change.
- Change? Into what? A frog?
Or the doormat you already are?
How would you feel if I said
I feel like messing around tonight?
Maybe I already have, with one
of your friends, to get even.
With Chris. Or...
with Vincent,
who you sent to have a word with me.
"Oh Miriam. He's really suffering!"
You're on a roll! You've won!
But half is mine, remember!
Twenty-one!
Did you give Sharon tickets?
- That hurts!
I won't give her any
but you do behind my back.
So? You're not her father.
- Have you seen what she looks like?
Like a whore!
- I thought whores turned you on?
What?
- Leave her alone, Filip, let her be.
She's having fun and I'm going
to do the same. I'm winning here.
You'll need it, given the amount
of stuff you put up your nose!
The pot calling the kettle black.
Make sure you save enough!
You may need it sooner than me.
D'you know what you should do? Start
divorce proceedings, you fuckin' bitch!
Divorce proceedings, Filip? So what?
You get nothing as long as
we don't have kids, jackass! Nothing!
Here. Have a go at roulette,
maybe you can make your fortune!
Ann?
We need to talk, doctor.
- What about?
Your friend, the architect...
He's playing a very dangerous game.
He should be extremely careful.
Can you tell him
to be very careful?
I thought
this was supposed to be about Ann.
Sorry.
I want you to stop seeing Ann.
Why would I do that?
- I love her.
Then you're not the only one.
- You, you pay her...
I want you to let her go.
- You know it's her choice.
We should just be happy
with what she gives us.
Sorry, but I've never paid her.
- That's true.
You haven't paid her. Not you...
- Be quiet, Alex.
Don't forget to give that message
to your friend, doctor.
What did he mean?
"Not you... "
I don't want to love you, Chris.
- What did he mean?
What did he mean
when he said I didn't pay you?
You're the only one who can hurt me.
Tell me it's not true, Ann!
The first time was paid for.
I was only a whore the first time.
All the other times, that was me.
- So who paid then?
Excuse me. Sharon, come with me, now!
- Filip, I can look after myself.
Come with me!
- Leave me alone.
Hey, pal! Are you deaf?
- Butt out!
Come on, Sharon.
- She doesn't want to, you prick!
Prick? Is that what it says here?
It's not, is it, you asshole?
- Stop it!
It's not there, is it? Fuck you!
OK, OK, let go, let go.
- Get him out of here.
Now. I never want to see you again.
Do you hear?
Never again. You jerk!
It's alright.
Who's that girl?
- Sarah, it's not what you think.
What do I think?
- She's a friend's sister.
She's just been assaulted,
there was a fight.
Are there any more?
- Don't be silly.
She's a best friend's sister, she's
still a kid. What do you take me for?
I'm not sure any more.
I can't be with you for too long.
My wife is here too.
Do you love me?
- You know I love you in my own way.
Your own way. And if you have to choose?
- It's not that simple, Sarah.
We'll go to the loft tomorrow. Barbara's
going away, we can talk about this then.
Shall I make choosing easier for you?
- How?
Get it over and done with.
What are you going to do?
Sarah!
Oh, sorry.
Did I hurt you?
Don't do it. You'll regret it.
Jesus! They know!
It's our wives.
Our wives have set us up.
Why, Vincent?
Because they found out about the loft.
Because they found out,
because it's all come out.
Why did you do it?
Why what?
I told you.
- Why us? We're your friends.
We're your friends!
It's our wives. They found out.
No, Vince, it's not our wives. It's
your friends. Your friends found out.
Your friends found out.
What's going on guys?
- You still don't get it, eh?
Come on, take his clothes off.
What are you doing to me?
- Did you have to do that to her?
Shut up! I just did what we agreed!
- Not like that, with all that blood!
Isn't that Latin on the wall a bit
over the top? Will the cops fall for it?
You should've done it yourself then!
- Stop it, guys. Later!
What's going on?
- Be quiet.
You killed her.
- We didn't kill her.
We just found her.
What?
- We were here earlier today, Vince.
This morning. Without you.
Jesus, man.
- First I thought she was asleep.
And Vincent knows her?
Yes, she left him a farewell letter.
We're going to have to
call the police, guys.
The public prosecutor comes in the
case of suicide. It'll all come out.
"See you in your next life... "
Hey, guys, can't we find out
where she lives and leave her there?
Come on, we've got to help Vincent.
He's a pal.
- Where is he, anyway?
It's his fucking problem.
I didn't call him.
- What? You didn't call him?
Why not, Luc?
- I've got something to show you, guys.
You've been filming us?
Are you crazy?
You can beat me to a pulp later,
if you want. We haven't got time now.
You need to see something that'll change
your outlook on the situation.
What d'you mean?
We don't have to take the rap for
a situation Vincent has got us into.
Vincent hasn't always been
such a good friend.
Hey, what's that?
What is that?
They came here late at night, that
evening he went to have a word with her.
She was drunk, Marnix,
and he took advantage of the fact.
I don't believe it.
Can't you have a word with her?
Maybe I already have. To get even.
With Vincent...
who you sent to have a word with me.
It'll be OK.
Is that your little sister?
Wow, she's grown into a real beauty.
How long?
- It doesn't matter, Filip...
It started right after your wedding.
They met here regularly.
He was her first.
She was a virgin.
Nice, eh?
You don't know me.
But you're not like that.
The first time was paid for.
- So who paid then?
He paid her to get you here, Chris.
You can only be hurt
by people you love.
He used her
like he used everyone else.
I'll kill him! I mean it!
No, I mean it.
- Calm down, pal.
If we stick to what we agreed,
we may stand a chance.
He mustn't know what we're going to do.
We have to pull together.
- We've no choice.
The police will question us.
- We mustn't admit to sharing the loft.
They'll try to play us off against
each other and we mustn't let them.
Jeez, you sound just like Vincent!
If all this comes out,
our lives are completely screwed too.
Chris?
OK. I'm in. On one condition.
I want to be sure.
Sure he was here last night.
I want to hear him say it. I'll give you
a sign, break a glass or something.
But nothing happens
until we're 100% certain.
So? What do we do now?
We've got two hours
to provide ourselves with alibis
and set everything up.
- I'll do it.
You don't have to, Filip.
- I'll manage.
Go on, make sure people see you.
Where's that farewell letter?
- I've got it.
You knew about this the whole time. The
whole time you watched and kept quiet.
You sleazy voyeur!
You're no better than him! Pervert!
- Be glad you now know.
No, Luc, I'm not glad I know.
Swallow, man.
What the hell has happened?
Is that your little sister?
She's grown into a real beauty!
How long?
- It doesn't matter, Filip.
Did you have to do that to her?
- I just did what we agreed.
Not with all that blood!
- Not like that, Filip.
That Latin on the walls.
Will the cops fall for it?
You staged it all. The whole thing.
It's all a set-up.
You set me up.
You fuckin' bastards!
My own pals.
Why did you do it, Vincent?
Fucking hypocrites.
You're all liars and cheats.
Why?
In God's name, why, Vincent?
Because I could, Chris.
Because it never means anything.
Because I'm above that!
I'm above that!
Am I gonna die?
- No, Vincent, you're not gonna die.
She enticed you here, drugged you,
then killed herself next to you.
But you will survive.
Because we're pals.
They set us up. Me and Sarah.
It was all staged.
A strange story!
- It's true.
I'd like to believe you, Mr Stevens,
but what we need are facts,
specifics, proof, facts.
Fact: we only found your fingerprints
in the loft. And Sarah Delporte's.
But they wiped the place clean!
Fact: you both had traces of sleeping
pills and alcohol in your blood.
And the DVDs of your performances
in bed. An impressive collection!
Luc recorded those.
I didn't know about them, no one did.
Shame they're all of you
and none of your friends.
None of Marnix's wife,
Filip's sister, no one.
What are we gonna do about this?
- Why didn't you tie her to the bed?
Was that so hard?
- She was dead!
That's no reason to cut her up!
- She killed herself.
I just made it more dramatic.
I hope your improvisation
doesn't cause problems.
Whatever he tells the cops, we keep mum.
- Luc's right. That wasn't necessary.
I hope we don't regret this.
You're questioning them,
put pressure on them!
Marnix will confess. Luc too maybe.
- We have.
There's no reason
to assume they're lying.
And they've got something you haven't.
An alibi.
Not for this morning!
- Yes.
Luc Seynaeve and Chris Van Outryve
were seen in a bar
and Marnix Laureys was at work.
- They can't have been!
We were together for at least an hour.
What about Filip? Where is he?
Filip's just come forward.
With his father-in-law.
What's Tyberghein doing here?
- He said Filip's been with him all day.
But Filip got to the loft after us.
- It's a watertight alibi, Mr Stevens.
Of course Tyberghein would say that.
I saw him with another woman.
Filip knew that and that
I'd put pressure on Tyberghein to...
Oh, so you're blackmailing
Ludwig Tyberghein too?
They're all cheats, all bad guys?
When are you going to tell us
what really happened?
Which we know anyway!
You murdered Sarah Delporte!
Murdered her? That's not true,
I didn't murder her!
Are you crazy?
I didn't murder her!
You can go, Mr Van Outryve.
Thank you for your cooperation.
We had to check your friend's story.
- Yes, of course.
There's one thing
that still baffles me, doctor.
Why does Vincent
continue to accuse his friends?
I've got no idea.
I don't get it either.
Could he be trying
to hide something else?
What do you mean?
That he murdered her.
Your colleague said it was suicide.
- That's what it looked like.
The autopsy showed
the sleeping pills didn't kill her.
Her wrist was slashed
but she didn't do it herself.
We didn't find
any hesitation cuts, doctor.
A person's first cuts to their arm
when slashing their wrist.
She hasn't got any.
Vincent wouldn't do something like that.
- His fingerprints are on the knife.
And we found no farewell letter.
Is something wrong, Mr Van Outryve?
Her wrist was slashed
but she didn't do it herself.
His fingerprints are on the knife.
We found no farewell letter.
Where is that farewell letter?
- I've got it.
You startled me!
Hi, Chris.
Is meeting here a good idea?
I think we've got a problem, Luc.
I think we were too thorough
in removing all traces.
What d'you mean?
- Where is Sarah's farewell letter?
You put it in your pocket.
- I thought so but it's gone.
When did you pinch it out of my pocket?
When someone rang the bell?
The real estate agent.
- I don't follow.
I'm sorry you've lost your letter
but it's nothing to do with me.
I phoned the agency
to ask who put our loft up for sale.
All they could give me was this number.
Yes, I phoned them.
I thought maybe, that way...
- Tell me it's not fuckin' true, Luc!
You didn't phone!
It's over, Chris. We made it.
We don't need to worry any more.
Why d'you take the letter
out of my pocket?
The only real proof of her suicide.
Maybe because
she didn't write it herself?
Could this be your handwriting?
Vincent deceived every single one of us.
You saw those images, Chris.
- Yes, I saw them.
Those images that made us so angry
we went along with your stupid plan.
What are you up to, Luc?
What are you up to?
What happened here last night?
What did you do to that girl?
Is it because she came between you
and Vincent? Was she in your way?
No, she wasn't in the way.
She wasn't.
Vincent was.
Are you in love with someone else, Luc?
Sarah! Hold on! Sarah!
Forget him, forget Vincent. He's much
better at those games than you.
He's hurting you, using you.
- And you had to come and tell me?
Why?
- I would never hurt you.
If you were to give me a chance...
What did you say?
I would never hurt you.
Never.
No, Luc, I know you'd never hurt me.
D'you know why? Because I could never
feel anything for you. Understand?
Never.
Maybe in another life,
but not in this one.
You were here last night?
I knew Vincent would see her.
Barbara was in France.
I'm sorry it has to end this way, Sarah.
I waited until he left.
She was surprised when she saw me
standing there. She was crying.
She said I was right about Vincent.
Consoling people,
that's all I'm good for.
You gave her those pills?
- The pills were designed to mislead.
Something's wrong.
What's happening to me?
I need some air. I don't feel well.
- It's OK, it's OK.
I gave her an overdose of insulin. It
works immediately and leaves no trace.
Jesus Christ, Luc.
- I did it for love, Chris. For love.
It was painful, loving her.
And you don't mind
Vincent taking the rap?
Vincent is a bastard.
He used us.
It was time someone used him.
Vincent is going to
take the rap for murder.
Sarah wasn't dead
when we left Filip with her.
She must've been.
- No.
You're lying, Chris.
- No.
I knew I shouldn't have left Filip
with her. What your brother did is sick!
Bastard! Sadist!
Sick!
- You're sick, Luc.
So if I understand correctly,
your brother murdered her.
Go home, Chris.
Luc'll clear up the mess, as usual.
You don't have to clean anything up.
It's over, it's all over.
Could you open the window, Chris?
Go on. Hurry up.
- Come on, Luc.
Shut up!
Down there.
What are you going to do?
- Shut up!
Going to kill me too?
What d'you want me to do, Luc?
Do you want me to jump?
- Go on.
Stop it, Luc!
Jesus!
- I don't want to hurt you. I swear.
I phoned them before I came in, Luc.
They're on their way here.
I told them everything.
You're lying. You're bluffing.
I know you.
I thought I knew you too, Luc.
And Sarah's letter?
You want it to go down with me?
Give me that letter. Give it here.
I won't ask you again.
It's over, Luc. Come on, it's over.
It's all over. Come on, Luc.
Come on, Luc.
Chris, tell Elsie and the kids
that I really loved them.
Will you do that?
- Don't, Luc.
Do it for Elsie, please.
- No, don't, Luc. Don't do it.
Luc!
No way, they've never met before.
It's obvious.
They're a couple.
- No, look how he's looking at her.
They're married.
- They're not! No way!
You can see they're having an affair.
- How can you see?
From the way he's showing off
and how she's holding her head.
They're having an affair.
- Have an affair or be square!
Says he who came round blubbering
and begging me to take him back.
Cheating is fun,
but getting caught is a bitch.
Don't start, tubby!
- She's a fine one to talk.
Right, I'm off.
- All your drivel scares people away.
I really have to go. The kids are coming
this weekend, I've got a lot to do.
Are you leaving me here with my wife?
How about another drink?
- We'll have lots more together, Marnix.
Chris?
Hello, Ann.
Long time no see.
- Yeah.
I've still got a key
I should give back to you.
I don't think it fits the lock any more.
Vincent lives there now.
It's the only thing
his wife allowed him to keep.
How's your brother?
- His case is heard next month.
We'll see.
And you? Everything alright?
- Yes.
For the most part.
- For the most part...
I made things difficult for you.
I'm sorry... honestly.
You can only be hurt
by people you love.
I learned that from you.
- I'm not sure I still believe in that.
You miss out on a lot if you do.
I've changed.
I heard you've even changed yourjob.
So you follow what I do, a bit.
- A bit.
Would you like to follow me a bit
for a cup of coffee or something?
I've changed too, Ann.
OK.
But...
I still drink coffee.
