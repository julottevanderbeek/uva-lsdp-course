Answer the phone!
-
-
No answer.
Keep trying... I'm sure
he's on his way back from...
Definitely on his way.
Why doesn't anybody
answer the phone?!
Hello?
James, you are so dead.
Shit!
Oh!
Sorry!
Excuse me... James Clayton.
Sorry I'm late.
I had a water bed emergency.
Bill Rudolph, Dell.
Nice to meet you.
Can I borrow your computer?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Hi, guys.
- Hey.
-
Ah...
It's here somewhere.
Here we go. All right.
At 7:00 this morning,
sound asleep,
I heard this cracking noise...
ripping wood.
I figure it's part of this
logging dream I'm having,
but, no, the bed
is falling through the floor.
Our program uses
existing wireless technology...
Which we modified,
transforming it into
a completely new program.
- And what do you call it?
- "Sp@rtacus."
Why is that?
It was named after
the revolt...
Of the slaves.
-
- Wireless Webcast.
We have that.
"Sp@rtacus" turns
any specified broadcast terminal
into its slave.
We control the program.
Watch.
Take a look.
Pick a screen.
Hello, Bill Rudolph.
MAN: Hey, who is this guy?
Somebody's hacking in.
MAN #2: What is this?
This is wonderful.
JAMES: Thank you.
Can you, uh, put our logo
on the Sony booths?
Sure...
for the right price.
- JAMES: We'll talk, yeah?
- Yeah.
Good.
The things you say? ##
## Where were you
when I was needy yesterday? ##
## You want in with me
now that it's good ##
## But it's too little,
too late ##
## Time and again,
I've asked you ##
## Just for some light ##
- Thank you.
- ## To show the way ##
- Hey.
- ## I was in total darkness ##
- What would you like?
- ## You act like... ##
I would like
to teach you something.
Okay. I'm pretty busy
right now.
James, the most important
thing you need to know
is that you don't know shit.
What you see...
...what you hear...
Nothing... is...
what it seems.
Drink?
Martini.
Sure.
That's how it begins, you know.
Call will come in a day or two.
His name is John Medica.
He's head of R&D for Dell.
He's gonna invite you out
for martinis.
Before long,
you're gonna be working
out of Advanced Encrypting
in Bethesda.
Five years, you'll get
your first annual trip to Texas.
You got a wife by then,
.5 kids, 200K a year,
and that's it...
that's the whole show.
Then you're dead.
And it all started because
of one nasty little martini.
So you're a recruiter.
That I am.
You're kidding.
Applications for the CIA
are up tenfold.
Wow.
Would I have to kill anyone?
Would you like to?
WOMAN: Beer man... Heineken?
Yeah, just a sec.
All I know about the CIA is
that they're a bunch of fat,
old white guys who fell asleep
when we needed them most.
Oh, well, like I said,
you don't know shit.
I know what I know.
- Nice meeting you, James.
- You too.
Way I figure, you'll probably
go in the oil business...
like your daddy.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Did you know my father?
James, I have recruited
and trained and served
with the best
our country has to offer
for over a quarter
of a century.
I am a scary judge of talent.
It's my gift.
I am recruiting you,
Mr. Clayton.
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not exactly CIA material.
You have any idea
what CIA material is?
It's not me.
No? Well, I don't know.
You graduated
top of your class at M.I.T.,
majored in nonlinear
cryptography,
scored off the charts in your
undergrad psych profile test.
Those are confidential.
Yeah, right.
You're agile,
athletic, and...
And what?
You grew up overseas...
Uzbekistan, Brunei...
Venezuela.
Yeah, my father worked
for Shell awhile.
Your father died in 1990...
in a plane crash in Peru.
What's your point?
What's my point?
What the hell you think
my point is?
My name is Walter Burke.
My number's
on the sports page.
Give me a call.
I'll be here
till noon tomorrow.
BURKE:
Very dramatic, James.
I want to talk.
Can we talk?
Yeah.
Where are you?
Well, you know the phone booth
you're calling from?
Yeah.
Turn around.
As you like it.
You're pretty confident.
Well...
Tell me about my father.
You already know, don't you?
I mean, that's why
you're sitting here.
You want answers,
you're in the wrong car, kid.
I only have secrets.
You can't trust
your best friends,
your five senses,
only the little voice
inside you
most civilians
don't even hear...
listen to that.
Trust yourself.
I think that's what
your father would have said.
Trust yourself, James.
Can I help you, sir?
James Clayton...
I'm here for an interview.
Just pull in there,
check in with security.
Thank you.
Hey, my name is James Clayton.
I'm here to see Walter Burke.
He's expecting me.
You can wait for him over there.
I'll page him for you.
James.
Hey.
Rule number one...
don't get caught.
Those were good officers.
Good friends.
So, you ready to get started?
Sure.
Have six pull in tight
on F-4.
All right,
now give me some angles,
both tests... both tests.
Tighter.
It's a carbon copy.
F-4... yank him.
You've been caught
cheating, pal.
Please leave.
Still got the eyes, Walter.
What's that story,
you saw some old woman
pushing a baby carriage?
And Walter sees the carriage is
riding a little low, so bam!
No questions, blows grandma
right out of her shoes.
Turned out she was Hamas,
and the whole thing was
stuffed with explosives.
She wasn't Hamas,
she was Abu Nidal.
Abu Nidal, that's right.
These war stories...
you just love them, don't you?
Uh, D-4...
tell him to forget the chick
and finish the test.
Burke says, "Forget the chick
and finish the test."
PS YCHIATRIST:
How do upsetting problems
generally make you feel?
JAMES: Upset.
And when you get angry,
do you have trouble
staying in control?
Sure.
How do you typically
deal with failure?
Badly.
Have you ever been deliberately
cruel to an animal?
Yes.
Please, elaborate.
For Christmas, I tied wool
reindeer horns to my dog's head.
PS YCHIATRIST #1:
Would you consider yourself
subjectively firm
or objectively flexible?
Metaphysically wrinkle-free.
Quickly... would you rather
ride on a train,
dance in the rain,
or feel no pain?
Feel no pain.
I know I said the rain-dancing
thing, but... feel no pain.
Thank you.
God, I hate this.
Hey.
Hi.
I'm James.
Layla.
Like the song.
Yeah.
That's a big coffee.
I'm a big girl.
Sure.
POLYGRAPH OPERATOR:
Is your name James Clayton?
James Douglas Clayton.
Just a yes-or-no answer.
Is your name James Clayton?
Yes.
You were born
October 21, 1976?
Yes.
Have you ever worked for
any foreign governments?
No.
Have you taken tranquilizers
today?
No.
Miami.
Mind if I sit here?
Sure.
Hey.
Ronnie Gibson from D.C.
James Clayton from all over.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
You got any idea what those two
are speaking over there?
I think it's Farsi.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Farsi.
MAN: Clear!
Uh, what are you doing?
Nothing.
What?
Some of these chairs
are wired.
They catch you drifting
during this,
Bullshit.
All right.
- Good morning.
- ALL: Good morning.
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Dennis Slayne.
I'm assistant director
of operations at Langley,
and I would like
to welcome you here
to the CIA Special
Training Facility,
affectionately known
as "the farm."
Now let me introduce to you
your senior instructor,
Mr. Walter Burke.
Morning.
ALL: Morning.
So, why are you here?
Why are you here?
It ain't the money.
A GS-15 pay grade officer,
yours truly...
I rake in about, what,
You can't buy
a decent sports car for that.
It ain't sex.
Hey, being here
won't get you laid.
Oh, you're
a dental hygienist?
I'm a member of the CIA,
Moscow Station chief.
-
- Hello?!
What about fame?
Our failures are known.
Our successes... are not.
That's the company motto.
You save the world,
they send you to some
dusty basement at Langley,
give you a little lemonade
and cookies,
and show you your medal.
You don't even get
to take it home.
So it ain't money,
it ain't sex, it ain't fame.
What is it?
I say we are all here
in this room
because we believe.
We believe in good and evil,
and we choose good.
We believe in right and wrong,
and we choose right.
Our cause is just.
Our enemies... everywhere.
They're all around us.
Some scary stuff out there.
Which brings us here...
to the farm.
You have all just stepped
through the looking glass.
What you see, what you hear...
nothing is what it seems.
Mr. Burke?
Hey.
I was just, uh... I was hoping
maybe I could buy you a beer
and we could talk.
I have so many questions
about my dad.
You're making a mistake, son.
Let me remedy it.
I was on semicongenial terms
with you
during your recruitment
for that reason...
I was recruiting you.
I'm not your friend.
I'm not your ally.
I'm your instructor...
period.
That enough talk?
Good morning. It's 0600.
All CTs report
to Common Area, 15 minutes.
Is everybody ready?
Morning.
- Let's go.
-
Let's go!
BURKE:
Over the next few months,
we're gonna teach you
how to deceive,
role-play,
psychologically assess,
sell, exploit.
We're gonna hand you
the tools...
the black arts.
Not witchcraft...
trade craft...
Ready! Fire!
...disguise, surveil, detect.
You will be able to kill
with a variety of weapons...
-
- Or none at all.
You will night-parachute,
rappel from choppers,
learn dry and wet demolition,
learn tactical, high-speed
emergency driving.
You will become...
Bond... James Bond.
Thank you, Mr. Clayton.
You're already role-playing.
That's good.
You're ahead of all of us.
Let's start with Clayton.
Why don't you take... Zack?
Aah!
Nice move.
Where the hell did
you learn how to do that?
ZACK:
Metro Dade Police Academy.
MAN: Are you a senior
instructor at the farm?
- BURKE: Yes.
-
POLYGRAPH OPERATOR: True.
Okay, if you look
at the screens,
you'll see his pulse is even,
respiration normal,
pupils undilated...
signs of the truth.
Come on, rough me up.
Let's go! Rough me up!
Have you ever worn
women's clothing?
Who said that?
Yes.
-
- True.
Were you, uh,
ever stationed in Peru?
Yes.
-
- POLYGRAPH OPERATOR: True.
Is your name Walter Burke?
- No.
-
True.
Let's do it.
Forth!
Skid and holster!
Remove your targets!
Nintendo.
These are paper ants...
microphone transmitters.
They adhere equally well
to flesh or clothing,
and they're biologically
manufactured,
so as soon
as they become separated
from their storage palate,
they begin to break down.
After 48 hours,
this bug consumes itself.
These are all live
surveillance devices...
digitized,
miniaturized transceivers,
audio and video.
You can conceal them
throughout the bug house.
Your objective is to gain entry,
install three bugs each,
and exit the bug house
without getting caught.
You will have eight minutes.
What do we got here, Walter,
a bunch of D.S. & T. Geeks,
or we got some quality
NOC people?
I don't know.
Anybody get out
of the bug house lately?
Not many.
Doesn't look like
it's gonna happen tonight.
Don't underestimate
my people, Dennis, please.
Usually by now,
you've tagged a NOC.
Must be one in this class.
Well, maybe yes, maybe no.
Who knows?
The Shadow knows.
I love this part.
-
- Buenas noches, amigo.
You've just been blanketed.
SLAYNE: That's two down.
BURKE: Oh, who's counting?
Buenas noches, amigo.
You've just been blanketed.
Attaboy.
Aah!
Ouch.
Go!
Go, go!
Who was that?
You okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
Some of you will not survive
the farm.
Some will be asked to leave.
Some will quit.
But those of you
who do graduate
will be sent to work
out of Langley
or embassies around the world
as official cover operatives.
That is, spies
with diplomatic immunity.
Now, every once in a while,
someone is selected to be
a nonofficial cover operative,
or N-O-C... NOC.
The NOC is the truest
practitioner of espionage...
always out there,
always alone, unprotected.
If you are caught,
you will most likely be
tortured, shot, and/or hanged.
And here's the best part...
no one will ever hear about it.
You will become a star
on a wall,
a blank space in a book.
Now, I can just feel
all you Alphas out there
gunning for this position
as I speak.
So remember,
everything is a test.
ZACK: Yeah? All right.
All right,
I can afford 10 cents.
Yo, I'm out.
All right, I'll see you.
Come on, you're gonna fold,
Ronnie. Just get it over with.
- You're a Miami cop, right?
- Yeah.
So why don't you
speak Spanish?
I do.
So where'd you learn Farsi...
Persian beat?
Oh, that's funny.
No, night school...
Florida Atlantic University...
so I could get in here.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
- Ronnie.
- I'm out.
Well, looks like it's just me
and Sonny Crockett.
RONNIE: Sonny Crockett...
is that the black guy
or the white guy?
What are the girls like
on South Beach?
What do you want to do?
All right.
## Sonny, you're a boy ##
## Make a big noise
playing on the street ##
I'll see your bet
and raise you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
$2 raises max, remember?
Come on, we're not playing
by the rules here on the farm.
Are we? Are we?
Are we, Sonny?
That's fine by me.
Okay. So...
Are my pupils dilated?
I could be bluffing.
Or it could just be dark
in here. What do you think?
## Gonna be a big man
someday ##
## You got mud on your face ##
Okay, I'll give it to you.
I fold.
- What did you have?
- Hey! That's not how we play.
Your deal.
Hey, man, good game.
Well, well, well...
Looks like boys' night in, huh?
Kinda sad.
I'm gonna change all that.
Time for a field trip.
We got the van outside.
We're all going for drinks
at the Blue Ridge.
All right, your objective...
reach the parking lot
with an asset who intends
to have sex with you.
You want us to pick up a girl?
Well, uh, five, actually...
one each.
## Change ##
## But be yourself, now ##
Hi.
Hi.
BARTENDER:
Here you go, Kitty.
- Thanks, Barry.
- ## Change ##
## But be yourself, now ##
## Change ##
## But be yourself, now ##
Not interested.
Neither am I.
How's that?
Well, your personal interests
are of no concern to me.
I just got out of the joint.
And there's only one thing
I'm concerned with right now.
And what would that be?
What do you think?
## Change ##
## But be yourself, now ##
## Change ##
## But be yourself, now ##
Sounds like fun.
Excuse me a second.
Hey... what's going on?
What are you doing here?
What's it look like?
Looks like you're drunk.
Perceptive.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's great.
All right.
See you tomorrow.
## =w, change ##
James...
## But be yourself, now ##
- They cut me. I'm out.
- ## Change ##
- You're kidding.
- ## But be yourself, now ##
- I'm out of the program.
- ## Change ##
You're serious...
did they say why?
They didn't say anything.
They just sit you down,
debrief you,
and then stick you
in some shit-bag motel.
## Change ##
## But be yourself, now ##
Sorry, all I can think about
is throwing up.
You all right?
Yeah, I think I had
too much tequila.
You know,
it's just that you and I
finally have
this chemistry moment,
you know, and I even have
a motel room
where we could go back
and have completely
justifiable comfort sex,
but all I can think about
is not throwing up.
The... the room's spinning,
right?
Yeah, like a top.
You should go home.
I'll call you a cab.
Come on. Come here.
Will you settle for taking
me home and tucking me in?
I wish.
Blue Ridge Bar, yeah.
Cab will be here in 10.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Come on, wait with me
outside, okay?
I...
Come on.
Layla, let's wait inside.
It's cold.
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Just wait.
Come on.
I want to kiss you.
Tell me about it.
Thank you.
For what?
Op completed.
My op was to stop you
from completing yours.
- Who said my op was complete?
-
- Lighten up, man.
- It's just an op.
Just doing her job,
that's it.
God, I hate this guy.
You did your job. Good.
ZACK: Are you a citizen
of the United States?
- Layla: Yes.
-
True.
Are you in any way
affiliated with the CIA?
No.
-
- It's false.
All right, let's break up
this dance team.
Clayton, switch places
with, uh, Zack here.
All right, we all know,
I believe,
what a lie is when we see it.
But a good interrogator
can also soften a subject...
you know, uh,
knock them off-balance,
make them vulnerable.
Never know what you might get.
So... fire at will.
Is your name Layla Moore?
- Yes.
-
True.
Last night at the bar,
you said we had
chemistry together.
Do we?
What?
His interrogation.
Answer the man.
Simple question...
yes or no?
I was undercover legend.
It was part of the op.
-
- True.
You said you wanted to go home
and have comfort sex.
Did you?
You're abusing this exercise.
Did you want to have sex with me
last night... yes or no?
No.
Would you do anything
to become a CIA officer?
Anything?
No.
Layla!
Stay away from me.
Can I talk to you?
There are limits, James.
You want to suck up to Burke,
do it on your own.
This isn't about Burke.
You won, okay?
You got even.
How does it feel?
Huh?
God!
I pity the fool.
Anyone I know?
Maybe.
Let it go.
You first.
I don't know how I...
I don't belong here.
Come on...
meant to do this, son.
You know more about me
than I do?
Hey, this bag knows more
about you than you do, James.
It's in you.
It's in your blood.
Aah!
BURKE: Mama Land's crabs
from the Circle's fourteenth
in Saigon...
best crabs in the world.
This place... second-best.
Okay, why don't you
just go ahead?
Go ahead and ask me.
Did you know him?
No.
I met him once.
Falklands... around '89.
What was he...
what was he doing there?
Think, son.
I can't tell you specifics.
I just can't.
I can't even confirm
his mission.
I can't.
He used to tell me stories.
He'd say, uh...
when they'd hit one,
the desert would rain oil.
That's what he did, James.
He told stories.
Yeah.
And he lied.
That doesn't mean
he didn't love you.
What was he, really?
What did he do?
You gotta come off it, kid.
You really do.
Because you keep looking back,
you're gonna miss
your whole life.
It's a mystery
you cannot solve.
Who is...
who is Edward Clayton?
Well, among many things,
he was James Clayton's father.
Also, he was someone else.
He was a spook, James...
just like me.
Just like you.
Don't look now.
By the bar...
we're being followed.
You serious?
Yeah.
Sometimes these guys
just like to loiter around,
see if they can gain intel
on the farm.
I'll get someone on it.
Hey.
Looking good.
Yeah, but can I do it
blindfolded
jumping out of a plane?
I bet you can.
Thanks.
It's probably not
the best time to apologize.
You don't have to apologize.
Can I?
Sure.
Here's how
I'm gonna look at it.
We learned a lot
about each other.
Yeah, the hard way.
Yeah, the hard way,
but still... at least we know.
Okay.
So, now...
we're ahead of the game.
Is that it?
Exactly.
So what do we do?
Nothing.
Not here.
Not now.
No, not now.
JAMES: One year from now,
where are you?
Probably waitressing
at Denny's.
Mm-hmm... yeah.
When I was a kid, my father
would get out the atlas...
BURKE: Okay, today we practice
the art of surveillance.
Remember your training.
The person being followed
is the...
Rabbit.
Rabbit. The person doing
the following is the...
- Eye.
- Eye.
Behind the eye is the rest
of the surveillance team,
who cannot see the rabbit
but follow the eye.
As the rabbit travels,
the teammates will rotate
themselves into the eye position
so that the rabbit doesn't
realize he's being followed.
Rabbit, don't forget,
your choke points
help you to identify
who's on your tail.
And keep those cellphones off.
In the field,
they act like homing devices.
All right?
What do we do?
ALL: Lmprovise, modify,
adapt, overcome.
Let's go to work!
Turn your cellphone off?
Didn't bring it.
Good.
Hey... this looks like
a good choke point.
You're right.
Let's hide here
and wait, okay?
Sure.
- LAYLA: James! James!
- Layla!
No!
James!
- Let go of me!
-
I am a Diplomatic Corps trainee.
We know that you work
for the CIA.
The CIA.
I don't work for the CIA.
I think you do.
Enjoy your cold shower.
Hungry, Jimmy?
You guys make the best stuff.
You realize that no country
with a McDonald's
has ever attacked
the United States?
They teach you that at the farm?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
You think this is
a game, James?
I think... it's a test.
No.
I'm sorry, my friend.
This is no test.
Everything is a test!
Everything is a test.
Good morning, James.
What are the names
of your instructors?
Okay.
Okay.
John is the wise guy.
Paul's the cute one.
- George is pretty quiet.
-
And this new kid...
I can't remember his name.
Oh.
Now I know why
she was begging for you.
You're funny.
Sorry if these stink.
She pissed herself.
Oh, Layla.
Layla?
Burke! You want a name?!
Burke! Burke!
I wanted you to see this.
I wanted you to see
what happens to someone...
you know...
someone you care about...
so you won't forget.
What you should learn
from this exercise...
and learn it well...
rule number one...
do... not... get... caught.
MAN ON TV: Hey, buddy, you are
sweating your ass off.
MAN #2: I know. It's hot.
No... I mean, you're really
sweating from the ass.
MAN #2: I'm so ashamed.
MAN #1: Don't worry, pal.
You just need
a little help back there.
- This is my secret.
-
Manpons?
MAN #1: It's like
a cool spring breeze
blowing through
your ass cheeks.
MAN #2: At this point,
I'll try anything.
Hello, this is Bill Rudolph
at Dell.
I'm not in right now, but please
leave a message at the beep.
I'll return your call as soon
as possible. Thank you.
Hey, Bill Rudolph,
thank you for calling me back.
It's James Douglas Clayton.
We met at M.I.T. in Boston
at... we... Sp@rtacus...
Sp@rtacus...
and I was
with my family for a while,
but now I'm back, and I'm ready
to raise the bar with Sp@rtacus,
'cause we can raise the bar
with Sp@rtacus
and change things.
Will you call me...
Nice hit.
What the...
You mind?
My throat.
Let go. Now.
Now.
What...
I see you're living good.
Get some clothes on.
We'll take a drive.
A drive?
Yeah. I'll wait outside.
That booze is coming out
of your bones.
What am I doing here?
I'm done, remember?
I'm out.
I don't have to play
your stupid games.
Oh, but you will, James.
You will play because
your particular engine...
what drives you, moves you,
motivates you...
desire to please...
Me.
- All right, pull over.
-
Pull over the goddamn car!
- All right! Go ahead, get out.
-
You lasted longer
on your interrogation exercise
than any CT has
in the last 15 years.
I broke!
Everybody breaks!
That's the point!
Damn thing doesn't stop
till you break.
Then why did I wash out?
You didn't!
That's why I'm here.
You're the NOC, James.
Bullshit.
The washout was faked.
You're the NOC.
I told you I was
a scary judge of talent.
Why me?
Get in here.
I don't believe this.
More farm mind games.
Nothing is what it seems,
na na na.
No, no, no, no.
School's out.
Open that, uh,
glove compartment.
Go ahead.

Find out why you.
That's why you.
Layla? Wh...
Layla Moore...
raised from the age of 3
by Tom and Susan Moore
of Worcester, Mass.
However, her real last name
isn't Moore... it's Nasari.
Birth mother is Algerian,
father's French.
It's all there...
secret bank accounts,
phony records, fake passports.
Layla's a sleeper.
She's a mole, James.
I don't believe it.
This is crazy.
How the hell
did she get into the farm...
We wanted her in.
We want her to burrow in
as deep as she can,
because then, she'll lead us
to her handlers.
We know exactly
what she wants.
It's who she's giving it to...
that's what we need to know.
Layla's gonna take us
right up the food chain.
I won't do it.
You won't do it?
James...
why do you think I came
to Cambridge to recruit you?
Nobody's chasing CTs anymore.
I mean, our applications
are through the roof.
We needed you... James.
No accidents.
You and Layla were matched.
She's an orphan.
You're a young man
searching for a father.
You're both highly motivated,
you're both highly independent.
You even look good together.
We paired you at the farm, son.
We paired you, remember?
The Blue Ridge barhop?
The lie detector session?
The choke point test?
And it worked, didn't it?
She trusts you.
Loves you, maybe.
And you're gonna take
that trust and that love
and you're gonna use it to
find out who she's working for.
James...
My first posting was
in Italy... Trieste.
A physics conference
met there every summer.
So I meet this local girl...
beautiful, sweet.
She's working for the Russian
group as a secretary.
Anyway, I did my job.
I worked her. I turned her.
Pretty soon, she's giving me
everything, you know...
I mean,
really high-grade stuff...
and, uh, I'm a hero.
But I'm still a kid, two years,
fresh out of Ocala, Florida.
I got this perfect Italian girl,
and she's crazy for me,
and we're falling in love.
I knew the Russians were
getting close to her.
I knew she was
in jeopardy, but...
material was valuable.
I could've warned her.
I could've saved her.
But the information
was more important.
You understand?
The information was more
important than she was...
more important than I was.
It is what we do.
I need to think about it.
Oh, come on.
"Think about it."
You got 24 hours.
