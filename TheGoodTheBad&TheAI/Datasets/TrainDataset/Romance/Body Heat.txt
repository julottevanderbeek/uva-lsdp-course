ANGELA:
My God, it's hot!
l got out of the shower
and started sweating again.
Still burning?
Jesus, it's bigger!
What is it?
NED: lt's the Seawater lnn.
My family used to eat there 25 years ago.
Now somebody's torched it
to clear the lot.
ANGELA: lt's a shame.
NED: Probably one of my clients.
ANGELA:
l'm leaving.
ANGELA: What do you care?
You're watching the fire.
You're done with me.
You've had your fun.
You're spent.
My history is burning up out there.
l don't mind.
l'm leaving.
l'm just getting into my uniform here.
Why do they make these
damn skirts so hard to zip?
NED: ''You're spent''?
Where did you hear that?
Mr. Racine, l no longer care
whether these alleged toilets. . .
. . .were ever actually en route
from lndiana.
l think we're wasting our time here.
lt's clear that your client
has attempted to defraud the county. . .
. . .in a not very ingenious manner.
The assistant prosecutor has made
what l consider a generous offer.
Given no semblance of a defense--
Judge, perhaps when
l've presented all the evidence--
Listen, if l were you. . .
. . .l would recommend to your client
to do as Mr. Lowenstein suggests.
Plead nolo contendere,
file chapter 1 1 . . .
. . .and agree to never do business
with Okeelanta County again.
You'd agree?
He could walk.
But don't test my patience.
lf he hesitates, l'll nail him.
l'll talk to him.
And Mr. Racine. . .
. . .next time you come to my courtroom,
either get a better defense. . .
. . .or a better class of client.
Thank you, Your Honor.
l underestimated you.
Don't know why it took me so long.
You use your incompetence
as a weapon.
My defense was evolving
and you guys got scared.
NED: Costanza doesn't like me.
What'd l do to him?
LOWENSTElN:
He thinks he belongs in circuit court.
He's here with top-notch corruption
and stuck with the county toilets.
Surprised you weren't in on the caper.
Could've been your quick score.
Or maybe Costanza was in on it.
That's why he was so mad.
What's the good word from the
halls of justice? Anything juicy?
Maybe Stella was in on it. When
will you get a real air conditioner?
You don't like it,
there are other places.
They don't have you.
l've got to go.
You can't buy me.
l don't come cheap.
MAN:
Lowenstein, you're a fag.
-Why does he do that?
-He's good. That's the weird part.
-You hear about Dr. Block?
-No. Do l want to?
Agnes Marshall.
Must've been
Mrs. Block's idea of punishment.
That's right.
How did you know that?
You are better plugged in than l am.
l guess you know about
Mrs. Block's friend in Ocean Grove.
Stella, this is beneath even you.
Things must be slow.
STELLA:
lt's the heat.
You can stand here with me, but you
must agree not to speak of the heat.
l'm a married woman.
-Meaning what?
-Meaning l'm not looking for company.
Should've said,
''a happily married woman. ''
That's my business.
What?
-How happy l am.
-And how happy is that?
Not too smart, are you?
l like that in a man.
What else do you like? Lazy?
Ugly? Horny? l've got them all.
You don't look lazy.
Tell me, does chat like this
work with most women?
lf they haven't been around much.
l wondered. l thought
maybe l was out of touch.
-Can l buy you a drink?
-l told you, l've got a husband.
-l'll buy him one too.
-He's out of town.
My favorite kind.
We'll drink to him.
He only comes up on weekends.
l'm liking him better all the time.
Take me up on this quick.
ln 45 minutes l'll get up and go away.
Want to buy me something?
l'll take one of those.
-What kind?
-Cherry.
NED:
Two cherries.
You're not staying in Miranda Beach.
NED: l would have noticed you.
MATTY: ls this town that small?
Pinehaven?
You're staying down in Pinehaven.
On the waterway.
-You have a house.
-How do you know that?
You look like Pinehaven.
How does Pinehaven look?
-Well-tended.
-l'm well-tended, all right.
Well-tended.
What about you?
Me?
l need tending. l need
someone to take care of me. . .
. . .someone to rub my tired muscles,
smooth out my sheets.
Get married.
l just need it for tonight.
Nice move, Matty.
Matty? l like it.
lt's right over your heart.
-At least it's cool. l was burning up.
-No talking about the heat.
Would you get me a paper towel,
dip it in cold water?
Right away.
l'll even wipe it off for you.
MATTY:
You don't want to lick it?
Look who's here.
lsn't this a coincidence.
NED:
l know you.
You're the one who hates
talking about heat.
-Too bad. l'd talk about chimes.
-What about them?
The wind chimes on my porch.
They keep ringing
and l go out, expecting a cool breeze.
That's what they always mean.
But not this year.
This year it's just hot air.
NED:
Do l remind you of hot air?
Bourbon, any kind, on the rocks.
Do you want another?
-What are you doing in Pinehaven?
-l'm no yokel.
l was all the way to Miami once.
Some men, once they get a whiff of it,
they trail you like a hound.
l'm not that eager.
-What's your name, anyway?
-Ned Racine.
Matty Walker.
NED: You all right?
MATTY: Yes, l'm fine.
My temperature runs a couple
of degrees high, around 1 00.
l don't mind.
lt's the engine or something.
Maybe you need a tune-up.
Don't tell me.
You have just the right tool.
l don't talk like that.
How did you find me, Ned?
This is the only joint in Pinehaven.
You shouldn't have come.
You're going to be disappointed.
NED:
What did l do?
A lot of them have tried that seat.
You're the first l've let stay.
You must come here a lot.
-Most men are little boys.
-Maybe you should drink at home.
-Too quiet.
-Maybe you shouldn't dress like that.
This is a blouse and skirt.
l don't know what you mean.
Then you shouldn't wear that body.
Sometimes, l don't know.
l just get so sick of everything,
l'm not sure l care anymore.
Do you know what l mean?
l know sometimes the shit comes down
so heavy l feel l should wear a hat.
That's what l mean.
l've got to go home.
-l'll take you.
-l have a car.
l'll follow you.
l want to see the chimes.
You want to see the chimes.
l want to hear them.
That's all.
lf l let you, then that's all.
l'm not looking for trouble.
This is my community bar.
l might have to come here
with my husband sometime.
Would you mind leaving before me?
Waiting in your car?
l know it seems silly.
l don't know who you think
we're going to fool.
You've been pretty friendly.
Now leave me alone.
NED:
Jesus!
lt's just like my place.
No help?
MATTY:
She goes home nights.
NED:
You're not nervous here alone?
MATTY:
No.
You do have chimes.
What's that?
MATTY: A gazebo.
NED: No, out there.
A boathouse.
What's in it?
A boat.
lt's a mess, really.
There's an old rowboat and
some lounge chairs, things like that.
l think you should go now.
NED:
l just got here.
You've seen them.
Please go.
Thank you.
l'm sorry.
l shouldn't have let you come.
-You're not so tough after all.
-No, l'm weak.
lt's so bright.
Please, Ned!
Do it!
NED: How are you doing?
Good walk!
BEVERLY:
Mrs. Singer.
NED:
Mrs. Singer!
NED: l would have
gladly come to your house.
The doctor said l should walk
and l did have some shopping.
Not that the quack knows
what he's talking about.
Mr. Racine, l'm just not sure
his testimony is going to be useful.
Don't worry about it, we'll find
a doctor who's more understanding.
-ls it bad today?
-You just can't imagine!
Nobody can repay me
for the pain l've had.
How well l know.
We'll sue those reckless bastards dry.
Excuse my language.
No, don't apologize.
You have to have an attitude
like that these days.
l like this place.
lt's got a nice feel.
MATTY: You were on top.
NED: Could use a better mattress.
NED: See to it, will you?
MATTY: Yes, sir.
NED: Give me a break here.
lt takes a little while.
MATTY:
lt's your own fault.
MATTY:
l never wanted it like this before.
lt throws everything else out of whack.
lt takes me a good 30 seconds.
Are you sure?
l just want to be sure.
NED:
What are you doing?
l have to wash these.
NED:
Afraid of your maid?
MATTY:
That's right.
MATTY: My mother told me,
''Knowledge is power. ''
NED:
This is an interesting interpretation.
NED: lsn't that why you've started
smoking my brand?
MATTY:
No one must know, Ned.
Promise me.
No one.
LOWENSTElN:
Take it easy. All right?
NED: You look terrible.
Don't you sleep?
l had a dream last night so boring
it woke me. l was afraid to sleep.
-Where have you been?
-Around.
l've barely seen you for a month.
Wait a minute, some new quiff, isn't it?
What's wrong with me?
You've never been shy
about this before.
NED:
Oscar!
OSCAR:
Weren't at the Y last week. We lost.
He's getting discreet.
l can't believe it.
OSCAR:
What you got in pie today, Stella?
STELLA:
There's cherry, cherry and cherry.
OSCAR: What do you recommend?
STELLA: The cherry.
OSCAR: Bring it on.
And a gigantic Coca-Cola.
l'm disappointed in you. l've been
living vicariously off you for years.
-lf you shut up, l only have my wife.
-Nothing to tell, l lead a lonely life.
OSCAR: Right, and it'll snow later today.
-And people are decent.
Probably someone in uniform?
LOWENSTElN:
No army personnel around. Waitress?
LOWENSTElN:
Could it be?
l know, l know!
You finally got to Glenda. Did she
let you into the no parking zone?
Glenda is seriously involved
with a narc from Palm Beach.
LOWENSTElN: What is that, his hobby?
NED: How's the cop business?
Real good. Always starts hopping
in weather like this.
When it's hot,
people try to kill each other.
l know some people who'll be dead
if we don't get a break soon.
OSCAR: Got more of everything bad
since the wave started.
lt's that crisis atmosphere.
People dress different, sweat more,
wake up cranky and never recover.
Look at Lowenstein.
Everything is just a little askew.
Pretty soon people think
the old rules are not in effect. . .
. . .and break them, figuring nobody
cares because it's emergency time.
Time out!
Oscar, l don't know how you can do
such advanced theoretical thinking. . .
. . .and still be stuck in our town.
Lowenstein dreams of bigger things.
Assistant County Prosecutor
isn't the end.
Someday, Deputy County Prosecutor!
When the truth's out
about the dirt l've been in. . .
. . .my future in this state
will be unlimited.
GLENDA:
Hi, Ned.
NED:
Hi, Glenda.
NED:
You all right?
MATTY:
Don't stop.
You are killing me.
l'm red, l'm sore.
You're sore?
You've got nerve.
Look at it.
lt's about to fall off.
ls there any more ice?
l'm burning up.
He's coming up tomorrow.
l can't stand the thought of him.
He's small. . .
. . .and mean. . .
. . .and weak.
NED:
Lady, you want to fuck?
Gee, l don't know.
Maybe.
-This sure is a friendly town.
NED: l'm sorry.
You are?
You mean the offer is no good?
l feel like a jerk.
Maybe you're supposed
to deliver it next door.
MARY ANN: You must be looking for
the lady of the house.
Ned, this is Mary Ann.
MARY ANN: We were just meeting.
Ned made me feel very welcome.
NED:
l am an idiot!
How are you?
You staying in town?
No, just passing through.
Nice area.
A little hot for my taste.
lt's unusual.
We're famous for our cool breezes.
Want to stay for dinner?
l've got to go.
MARY ANN:
Got to go.
You two have fun now.
l didn't see her car.
l'm sorry.
l've got to be more careful.
Mary Ann is an old friend.
She's like a sister to me.
She wants me to be happy.
NED:
How do you know?
MATTY:
l saw the will once.
MATTY:
He showed it to me.
MATTY: Trying to prove how much
he loved me, or something.
NED:
How did he get so fat?
MATTY: Stock market,
real estate, investments.
MATTY: He doesn't tell me much,
but l've picked up a little.
-They own lots of land at the shore.
NED: Who's ''they''?
MATTY: He's never introduced me to
anyone. l'm not sure they're legitimate.
NED:
l wonder what they call themselves.
MATTY: l know they own that place
in Miranda Beach, The Breakers.
NED: The Breakers? l thought
Morrie Fisher owned that land.
Edmund mentioned it once.
lt scares me
to talk about these things.
NED:
Why?
MATTY: You know.
NED: No, l don't.
Let's just not.
Let's not think about all he's got.
NED:
Wait a minute.
Tell me exactly what it is
that frightens you.
l'm afraid because. . .
. . .when l think about it. . .
. . .l wish he'd die.
That's really what l want.
lt's horrible and it's ugly. . .
. . .and it's what l most want.
NED: That's where we're at, isn't it?
-What do you mean?
NED: That's what we're both thinking.
How good it would be if he was gone.
No, please.
Don't talk about it.
Talk is dangerous,
makes things happen.
-lt makes them real.
NED: Don't get scared.
Because he is not going to die.
Nothing wrong with him, is there?
No reason to think he'll die?
That's right.
So we might as well forget about it.
lt's not going to just happen
to make things nice for us.
lt won't just happen.
NED: lf you leave him,
you'll do all right.
MATTTY: A divorce?
NED: Yeah, he's ripe.
No. l signed a prenuptial agreement.
-What?
-He insisted.
He blamed it on his sister, Roz.
She hates me, but he wanted it too.
-How is it?
-lt's bad.
l get some money for a year,
not much. That's it.
Does it matter, Ned?
Tell me the truth, please.
The truth!
l wish you were going to be loaded.
Does it matter? No.
God, you make me happy!
lt's time for your present.
Now, when it starts coming down on you,
l'll be there to protect you.
Try it on.
l bet l guessed the size right.
l love it!
NED:
l want to see.
MATTY:
Here.
Hello, sweetheart.
Have l got a nice present for you!
Hi, Aunt Matty.
Heather.
EDMUND: What is it again?
HEATHER: Rover.
HEATHER: lt's between first and second.
EDMUND: That's not a shortstop?
No. The shortstop is between
second and third.
Good, that's the way l remember it.
EDMUND:
Have a good time.
You don't really mind, do you?
Roz will pick her up Thursday.
Don't worry.
Roz won't stay overnight.
She can do whatever she wants.
Oh, my God!
You scared me.
You shouldn't be here.
Heather's upstairs.
NED: Asleep.
And l know what l want.
l know. l missed you so badly,
but it's too dangerous.
-She won't wake now.
-You're so wet.
NED:
l waited out there for 2 hours.
MATTY:
You're so salty.
MATTY:
Let me.
Lie back.
HEATHER:
Aunt Matty?
What do you say?
-l did!
MATTY: She did.
Thank you, Aunt Matty.
-Thanks, Matty. We appreciate it.
-A pleasure, Roz. Any time.
-lt's just me tonight, Filomena.
-Okay. Just one minute.
Well, hello to you!
Darling, this is Mr. Racine.
l'm sorry, l don't know your first name.
Ned.
Edmund Walker.
Nice to meet you.
Mr. Racine is the lawyer
l told you about.
You remember. He had a client
who wanted to buy the house.
MATTY: l told him we weren't selling.
-Right.
NED:
That hasn't changed, has it?
No, we're very happy with it.
l can understand that.
lt's a terrific place.
Are you going in?
l was going to grab a bite.
Join us.
-No! Thanks, l don't want to interfere.
-No. Don't be silly.
We have room for three, don't we?
EDMUND: lt's great,
but you can't get near it on weekends.
-l don't get down during the week much.
NED: ls that right?
l was a lawyer.
l still am, but l don't practice.
-l went to Columbia. And you?
NED: F.S.U.
EDMUND: A good school.
l got bored with it quick.
l didn't have the temperament for it.
l wanted to make the money faster.
EDMUND:
ls there a living in it here?
l can afford to send out my shirts. . .
. . .and eat here once a month
if l don't order an appetizer.
Honest lawyers don't make much
and the other kind are too slimy for me.
l'd rather be up-front
about shafting somebody.
MATTY:
Edmund, really!
-lt's his profession.
NED: That's all right.
l don't like it much.
Call me Ned, will you?
EDMUND:
What's to like?
lt's the way of the world.
Most people despise their jobs.
Do you?
EDMUND:
No, l love it.
But it's not a job.
What is it exactly?
l do various things.
This and that.
EDMUND: Here and there.
NED: You don't have to be specific.
Finance, basically.
Venture capital, real estate. . .
. . .investments.
We're into a few things.
-Around here?
EDMUND: Some.
EDMUND:
Some things here.
Edmund's company owns The Breakers.
NED: Really?
EDMUND: lt's not that simple, really.
We have an interest
in a few places along the shore.
For the land, someday.
Don't try explaining it to her.
l'm too dumb.
A woman, you know.
l'll be right back.
Then maybe we can talk about
pantyhose or something interesting.
She's something, isn't she?
NED:
She is a lovely lady.
EDMUND:
Yes, she is.
And l'm crazy about her.
lf l thought she was seeing
another guy. . . .
l don't know.
l could understand how it could happen,
the way she is.
l could understand it, but. . .
. . .l think l'd kill the guy
with my bare hands.
That's understanding.
NED:
Please.
You'd never believe the dorkus
she was with when l met her.
The guy came to us
with a business proposition.
We're always looking for opportunities.
We're willing to take a risk. . .
. . .if the downside's not too steep,
if conditions are right.
But this guy,
he hadn't done his homework.
He didn't know the bottom line.
That's how l knew he was full of shit.
Got to know the bottom line.
That's all that counts.
But he didn't have the goods,
this guy.
Like lots of guys you run into. . .
. . .they want to get rich, do it quick,
be there with one score. . . .
But they're not willing to do
what's necessary. You know what l mean?
l'm not sure. You mean
do the groundwork? Earn it?
No, l mean,
do what's necessary.
Whatever is necessary.
l know that kind of guy.
l hate that. lt makes me sick.
Me too.
l'm a lot like that.
BEVERLY: Some messages are on your desk.
l'll be back in an hour.
Jesus!
Did Beverly see you?
l waited until l saw her leave.
MATTY:
Please, don't be angry.
Angry? l'm not angry.
How did you get in?
MATTY:
lt didn't lock.
Ned, hold me.
Please.
MATTY:
Just hold me.
MATTY:
God, l love you!
MATTY:
He left this morning.
MATTY: l had to see you.
NED: l know.
l couldn't call.
l was afraid to. l was afraid
you wouldn't let me come.
You mustn't call.
Never call.
Be careful.
The phone company keeps records.
l am careful.
Ned, l hated it.
l hated sitting there with you two.
l thought l'd scream.
You called my apartment from the house.
MATTY: No, never.
-Those two times?
MATTY:
l went to phone booths.
l'm afraid of him--
That's good. Be very careful now
about the phones.
-Why say this now?
-We can account for some calls.
We've had some contact.
Why?
What's happened?
Because we're going to kill him.
We both know that.
lt's what you want, isn't it?
We knew it was coming.
lt's the only way we can
have everything we want.
That man is going to die. . .
. . .for no reason but we want him dead.
He doesn't deserve it.
Let's not ever say that.
We'll do it for us. You get half of all
he owns, that's what the will says.
NED:
That's it, then.
We're going to kill him.
And l think l know how.
-lt's real, then?
-lt's real, all right.
And if we're not careful,
it'll be the last real thing we do.
MATTY: Her mother works plenty hard
to keep Heather on Edmund's mind.
Always bringing her around,
reporting on what she does in school.
That Roz is a smart one.
And anything Heather inherits goes
to Roz. Heather won't even see it.
That's what seems so wrong,
that half of it should go to her.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Are you sure?
l was thinking that maybe there is.
The will is with Edmund's lawyer
in Miami. l know that.
What if l got him to bring it home?
And couldn't we rewrite it?
Change it?
Every change would mean a lot for us.
You know how to write it.
lt wouldn't seem so odd.
l'd say he brought it home and we
decided to make some changes up here.
-And l knew you already--
NED: No!
Forget it.
Why should Heather take half?
Nothing strange can happen
in his life now.
Not one thing out of the ordinary.
That's the most important thing.
lf it does,
the chances double that we get caught.
You'll get half of everything.
lt'll be plenty, no matter what.
We won't get greedy.
lf we do, we'll get burned.
You're right, darling.
l'm sorry.
l know you're right.
l know where he is.
lt's not far from here.
-l don't want you with me.
-l thought we settled that.
l'll wait in the car. . .
. . .but l want to take the risk with you.
We're both doing this.
What's the matter?
Can't think with music?
lt's like this, l said.
lt's fast, it's hot, it's simple.
You can use the clock
or rig it to something that moves.
lt starts big.
lt will go with just the mag chips.
You want a little more,
splash a little accelerator around.
NED:
ls it just regular gasoline?
Regular, unleaded, supreme.
Whatever you like, Counselor.
l got to tell you, though,
this mama has a big drawback.
lt's easy to spot.
Even after the meltdown,
they're going to know it's arson.
l don't care about that.
That's all there is to it?
No, that ain't all. You've got
to get in, you've got to get out.
You've got to pick the right spot,
the right time. . .
. . .and try not to get famous
while you're in the act.
lf that's all,
any idiot could do it.
NED:
l'm sorry.
l want to ask you something.
Are you listening to me, asshole?
Because l like you.
l got a serious question for you.
What are you doing?
This is not shit for you
to be messing with.
Ready to hear something? l want you
to see if this sounds familiar.
Any time you try a decent crime,
you've got 50 ways you can fuck up.
lf you think of 25 of them, you're a
genius. And you ain't no genius.
Remember who told me that?
No smoking in here.
Look, why don't you let me
do it for you? Gratis. l'll do it.
l wouldn't be on the street
except for you.
Thanks.
l sure hope you know
what you're doing.
You better be damn sure,
because if you ain't, don't do it.
Of course, that's
my recommendation, anyway.
Don't do it.
Because l'll tell you something,
Counselor. This arson is serious crime.
NED:
And?
MATTY:
You'll be downstairs.
MATTY:
We won't talk again
after l leave here tonight.
l'll be in Miami Friday.
You won't be able to reach me.
When l see you again,
he'll be dead.
l'm frightened.
EDMUND:
Jesus, take it easy!
EDMUND: l thought l was tense.
MATTY: Where are you going?
EDMUND:
l can't sleep.
-l'm going to get something to drink.
MATTY: Edmund.
l can't sleep, either.
Come back to bed, darling.
MATTY:
Don't stop.
Are you trying to kill me?
MATTY:
What's wrong?
l think someone's downstairs.
l heard something.
