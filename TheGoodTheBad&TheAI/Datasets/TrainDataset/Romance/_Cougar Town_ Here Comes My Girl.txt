OK, the sales after Thanksgiving
this year are going to be insane.
We're talking full-on shopping orgy.
We are gonna save so much money
by spending money.
Yes, we are. Now, the key
to a successful Black Friday
is this scouting trip
where we locate, justify and hide, OK?
Locate: This is a very cute T-shirt.
Justify: I would wear this because...
- You could wear it to buy other things.
- It would be perfect for that.
Plus, it's got that really cool
gun design.
- That's Africa, Laurie.
- So dumb.
Finally, we hide it so no one else
buys it before the sale starts.
I'm on it!
So who's coming to Thanksgiving
this year?
It's my first one post-divorce,
so I kinda wanna keep it small.
- Travis, you and Andy.
- But I love big Thanksgivings.
You fill up your house
with family members you don't like,
pump them full of cheap wine
and you watch their lives fall apart.
Bobby and I decided to separate
last Thanksgiving.
I remember.
- Where did you hide it?
- In your car.
Laurie, shoplifting is not part
of Locate, Justify, Hide.
You shop differently than I do.
Do you want me to go get it?
I already mailed them a
check, which they will receive on Friday
when this shirt is half-price,
so this isn't stealing.
Whatever you need to tell yourself.
- Jules, I can come to Thanksgiving.
- Oh, joy.
Dale had invited me to his foster mom's
apartment, but I'm not gonna go.
Mostly because her apartment
is more like a rehab center.
- Quick question...
- Dale can't come.
- Even just to...
- Poke his head in and say "hi."
- But he shaved his rat-tail.
- Yeah, no.
- He bought real pants.
- Still no.
So you're having the whole gang
over for Turkey Day, huh?
- Well...
- I don't really have any plans,
seeing as my wife left and all our
friends were pretty much her friends.
Plus, my parents are dead.
- Did they die in the last six months?
- No.
Then who cares?
Hand me my drink.
You don't have to fish for an invite,
I'd love for you to come.
I guess I could probably come.
- Yeah, I'll never do that.
- Yes, he will.
I know, I can't wait.
So, there was a huge line for the can,
I had to use the men's room and I met
a guy. Can he come to Thanksgiving?
She said no, Steve!
Could've been the one.
Hey, J-Bird. Now you think you can
make a real stuffing this year?
This instant stuff's bush league.
You can't just assume
that you're invited.
You want me to eat alone on my boat
like an old Japanese man?
I just... I wanted
a small Thanksgiving this year.
- No, you don't.
- All right, fine.
I was pretending to want a small one so
that when I buckled and had a big one,
I'd be known as the hero
who saved Thanksgiving.
- You think so much your head must hurt.
- It does, it really does.
Not me.
Always free and breezy
up here, baby.
Hey! Can Kylie come by tomorrow?
Her family doesn't really do
Thanksgiving.
- Aw, broken home?
- Filter, Mom.
- Of course Kylie can come!
- Not your call, Bobby.
Of course you can come. But just know,
you're gonna sit next to me
and we're gonna break down
your family a little bit.
Bring it, Mrs. Cobb.
- I like this one.
- Thanks again.
- Very welcome, Kylie!
- Again, not for you to say.
You know, those two are pretty tight.
You had the doink talk with Trav, right?
Honey, I got pregnant way too young.
I've been having the doink talk
with Travis
every three months
since he was nine.
I used to teach him
by using little stuffed animals.
I'd tape tiny private parts on them.
That bit me in the ass, though,
on show-and-tell day.
Yeah, Trav and I had
the father-son talk when he was 16.
We actually didn't talk, you know,
but I showed him how to move his hips.
Normally I'd be mad,
but Travis really needs the help.
- Have you ever seen him dance?
- Hm-hm.
It's like he is dodging bullets, with...
Do you remember
that great Thanksgiving blow-up
when your Uncle Bud got drunk
and told your cousin she was adopted?
She was 14 and Korean, Ellie.
On some level she knew.
Oh, hi, Grayson.
Do you wanna ask me something?
Yeah, you wanna ask her something?
- I can't do this.
- Come on, G-String.
Think of how much fun
we're gonna have. Drinking beer...
Wine, when all the beer runs out.
Come on, Grayson. You must be great at
saying things you don't mean to women,
like, "I'll call you" or
"I've never done this before either."
Fine! May I come over
for Thanksgiving?
You know, I'm gonna
answer you like this...
Come on, it's
like trying to break a horse!
She won't let go
until you just relax into it, man.
Yeah...
OK, we're done.
A-Team, what's with the burger?
Turkey time's in like three hours.
Thanksgiving is a food marathon.
You have to warm up.
This is like stretching.
- Want a bite?
- No can do-sie.
Just got my cholesterol results
and I'm rocking three bills.
Still cooking everything
in that travel fryer?
- GAC.
- That's not healthy.
Hm...
All right, hey, listen.
Don't tell Jules, all right?
She'll get all worried and care-takey.
That info is locked up.
All right, now hide that key
where I'll never find it.
I don't have to. I trust you that much.
Wow.
What you got in your hand there,
champ?
It's a... tiny pretend key.
- OK...
- Excuse me. Quick announcement:
I'm about to bring Kylie in,
so I need you all to act
like normal human beings.
Boo!
I know, it's gonna be hard.
But I can help.
Mrs. Torres, Kylie doesn't have
an eating disorder.
She runs cross-country,
think of a new question.
Mr. Torres, I don't care how much
you eat, let's keep our pants buttoned.
Laurie, your breasts are bigger
than hers. There, I said it.
You don't need to tell her.
Neighbor guy,
you brought your fruity guitar.
Let's keep that holstered. Mom,
you have multiple problem areas,
so when in doubt, just say to yourself,
"That's a bad idea."
And, Dad, we both know
it's best you don't say anything.
- That was a little snarky.
- Yeah, he's just nervous.
It's the first time he's brought a girl
to a family thing.
So I think we all know
what we have to do.
The whole...
Hello? Mom?
Hi, Kylie
Hi, Kylie
Hi, Kylie
- Hi, Kylie.
- Mom...
No, no! There's a big finish.
Hey, come on...
Hi, Kylie
Whoo!
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, cool it, she's still here.
Aren't you, Kylie?
Cougar Town 1x09 - Here Comes My Girl
Kylie, awesome job surviving
the first wave of embarrassment.
I just gritted my teeth
and went somewhere else.
- Atta girl.
- I'll grab you a soda.
For you ladies, I assume
two giant buckets of wine?
- Red, please.
- Half red, half white.
What? It's really good.
Now, that is a very cute top!
I mean, I clearly couldn't wear it,
because of these puppies, but...
OK.
Leave her alone.
That's a nice necklace.
Are your parents rich?
- Here you go!
- Oh, thanks.
That first sip. It burns
your throat just a little bit,
but then when it hits your head,
it's like, oh, yeah...
Jules Cobb on drinking.
So... Kylie seems sweet.
- She's pretty great.
- Yeah...
Are you having sex?
Wow! Just diving right in.
Courage. Oh, come on, we're not
like other mother-son combos.
- We're friends.
- I know, but...
Are you sure you want
to go down that road?
- I think it'll be fun.
- All right, well...
Yeah, I think Kylie...
Kylie could be the one.
Aw!
But I'm really nervous,
because I...
- You know, it's my...
- First time. Aw!
OK, do you mind if I put
the friend thing on hold for a second
- and get on that Mom train?
- I'll allow it.
Look, I know you're 18 and
you're gonna do what you wanna do.
But, oh, please remember that talk we
had about just being ready emotionally.
And, oh, my God, protection.
Want me to show you how to put
a condom on again?
- 'Cause we can get the rolling pin.
- I'm good.
Plus, the rolling pin made me
feel kind of bad about myself.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, of course it did.
- Well, thanks for being so cool, Mom.
- No problem.
Hey, wait. You just called me cool.
- Do you mind if I tell everyone that?
- Go nuts. The guys are gone, though.
It's their annual "let's pretend
we're not old" basketball game
against the neighbors.
Whoo!
Ooh!
Yes!
Calm down. We're still up by three.
- Shut up, Lisa!
- Andy, come here, get over here.
Don't get sucked into her trash talk.
That's what she wants.
Now, if we bear down,
we can win this thing!
Yeah, I hope so. My guy's
shoes light up when he jumps.
All right, hands in!
Let's leave it all out there.
- I love you guys.
- One, two, three...
- Win!
- Defense!
Yes!
And I'll say it.
I'm glad we won, but I'm even happier
Lisa sprained her ankle.
Remember this day, Andy.
I am gonna raise
this summer sausage to you.
Nope! No more fatty foods for you.
You can't die yet, Travis needs you.
And I don't have a great black dress.
- You told her?
- Oh, calm down, gravy veins.
- He told me, I told her.
- Why?
Because I want
to get this par-tay started.
Come on, he betrayed you. Go.
Sorry, man. When I try
to keep a secret from Ellie,
I get heartburn and just...
it hurts so bad.
Off the couch!
God bless us, every one.
I do not know how Andy does it.
No offense, but I could not be
with someone like you.
Everyone in the world like me
thanks you.
I guess you'll have to stick
with those middle-aged golf biddies
who are willing to spring for tacos
in exchange for human touch.
- Hey, Ellie. Happy Thanksgiving.
- And you.
Enough with the 20-something
bimbos. It's pathetic.
What just happened?
OK, this turkey should be done
in about 17 more hours.
So... you and Kylie
just chilling in the bedroom?
- Don't get weird.
- I'm not being weird!
- You don't be weird.
- It's not gonna be tonight.
I know, silly.
It's gonna be tomorrow
when her parents go away.
Oh.
Tomorrow. My son's gonna be
making love, tomorrow.
- Congratulations?
- I know when it's gonna be, and where.
And now that Bobby taught him his hip
thing, I even know the basic rhythm.
One and two, and one, two, three,
and one and two, and pause...
Dale is just, like, one, two,
three, four, five, bam!
- And then he farts.
- Later. But you know what?
Travis, you've had a million talks
with him. It's gonna be OK.
In one of our friend talks,
he told me she's not on the pill.
Condoms break all the time.
Especially
if there's piercings involved.
- Stop, I'm begging you.
- I'm gonna be a grandmother at 41!
- They're gonna put me on the news!
- Keep it together, sweetie.
Not gonna happen.
What kind of mother lets her daughter
wear a slutty cardigan like that
without putting her on the pill?
Whore.
I'm not proud that sometimes
I hook up with women for food.
It's not my fault every 24-year-old
on Earth has a daddy complex
and thinks my name's exotic.
- Still, we both know it's not forever.
- Hell no.
Someday I'm gonna find me a real
woman, someone who looks after me.
Yeah! And someone
that helps get me out of my shell.
- I don't want to end up alone.
- That would kill me.
Oh! Getting deep alert!
- Permission to speak?
- Proceed.
Do you think the woman
you're looking for is even out there?
- Yeah.
- Definitely.
Oh, my chest.
Oh, good, you're on the bed.
- Do you know what this is?
- Is it a water balloon?
Close. It's a condom filled with water.
That is not good news.
I mean, people think that condoms
are foolproof, but they're not.
These things can break.
OK, they may not break right away,
but you know,
once you get started,
this could happen.
Come on!
All right, this isn't fair because this
is a balloon that I got at a toy store,
'cause I thought it'd be weird
to use a real condom.
- You thought that would be weird?
- Why won't you break?
No one's gonna stomp on it, Mom.
Why is she doing this?
I'm sorry, Kylie, it's...
I had talked to Travis
and I happen to know
tomorrow night's the big night.
Travis?
I was just rapping
with my boy there and...
Tell her I'm cool. I'm so cool...
I think I should just go home.
Wow.
I trusted you.
Well...
Of course.
That was the worst sex talk ever.
I'm a horrible mom.
Make me feel better, Grayson.
I'm gonna go check on Stan.
Can you think of anything
more uncomfortable
than what I just put Travis through?
- Actually I could think of a...
- I can.
Let's go play some hoops.
You wanna go play some hoops?
Hoops. Man, that's my middle name,
is Hoops. I love hoops.
I feel terrible.
I mean, Travis was never great
with the ladies.
When he was 12
he met this girl at camp,
and he used to write her
all these love letters.
But the address she gave him
was to a dog toy factory in Wisconsin,
so the letters kept getting returned.
I don't want his heart to break
so I started to write him back.
I only had to break up with him
because he hit puberty
and started mailing me pictures
and asking me to do some weird stuff.
This is gonna blow over and Travis
won't talk to you for a couple of days.
No. I'm the hero who saved
Thanksgiving. I have to fix this now.
I just gotta get Kylie not to leave.
This is her purse.
She's not gonna leave
without her purse.
- What are you doing?
- Locate, Justify, Hide, Ellie.
Locate: I got it.
Justify: I gotta do it.
- Hide: I'm on it.
-
Why do we have
to hide the bag outside?
Because Travis has found
every present I ever hid for him,
except for the ones
buried in this backyard.
Now, we gotta grab a shovel,
and remember where we put it.
There's still a Discman buried here
somewhere. Here you go.
Are you really gonna bury my purse?
Why are your boyfriends acting so weird?
First of all, only Bobby's my boyfriend.
And they're not acting weird.
You know
you're on the same team, right?
- Shut up, Lisa!
- Mind your own business, Lisa!
- Foul!
- You're hiding something.
Normally, I'd wait for that chest gas
to push it on out of you,
- but this seems too juicy.
- You can't make me tell.
Do you remember when we used
to have sex in inappropriate places?
Not in front of Stan. Wake up.
Like baby Rick's third birthday party,
when you took me
against the bouncy house?
- Get a hold of these.
- Oh.
Mom?
How's that feel, Mr. Torres?
Do you like that?
- I do like it, I do. Oh.
- Yeah?
- But thanks for saving me.
- You will tell me!
It's weird that you won't give me
my purse back.
- Well, if I do, are you gonna leave?
- Yes.
Look, I just want to talk to you
for a second.
And I promise I'm not gonna
make you uncomfortable,
because if I start to say anything
crazy, Laurie is gonna stop me.
Oh! Yes! I can just make a noise
or something.
Fine.
Kylie, this is my fault.
I mean, Travis and I are so tight
the line between friend and mother
has always been a little blurry.
You know, up until a few years ago
he was taking naps in my bed...
Thank you.
Now, the point is,
is that Travis confided in me
and I took advantage of that.
I just wish
he hadn't told you everything.
It's just awkward for him.
You know, he's still a virgin.
He told me he wasn't.
Oh, God.
Why didn't you stop me?
I really thought
I had time to take a sip.
Clearly not.
All right, Kylie...
If you go, I understand.
But I hope you stay for Travis,
'cause he really cares about you.
Come on, sweetie.
Please don't torture him
the way my mom tortures me.
I gotta say, I am loving this
Thanksgiving drama
- you two have going on.
- Glad I could help.
Would you stop with this
end-of-the-world nonsense?
You and this girl are gonna bond
over how horrible your mom is,
- you'll get in her pants within a week.
- You make it sound so beautiful.
Look, parenting
doesn't come naturally to me.
Luckily, Andy's a great dad.
He would've been a great woman.
He would've loved
breastfeeding.
I really would have. Hmm.
I need you to cut your mom some slack.
I have a lot riding on this relationship
you have with her.
I'm basing my whole
parenting strategy around it.
- Worst decision ever.
- Please.
And you know as well as I do
that in the end,
your mom always comes through for you.
Hey, Trav?
- You wanna talk?
- Sure.
Got a little intense out there, huh?
At one point, I straight
punched you in the face.
Don't get blood on my frozen corn.
If anybody's still here,
we're eating that in 20 minutes.
This is dicey.
Should we just try to hash it out?
Probably. But then again, you know,
it feels like we'd be talking about
something way in the future,
you know, like, years.
Who knows how we'll feel by then?
One of us may even be dead.
- Yeah, and with your cholesterol...
- Oh, yeah, it'll be me.
Look, I say we act like men,
and we bury it under
a mountain of denial so deep
no one can make us believe
that it ever actually happened.
Already done. Free and breezy.
Want a beer?
- I'll have two.
- Nice.
OK, quick disclaimer:
When we attack the food,
let's chew carefully
because I'm missing an earring.
OK, grab a hand.
This is my favorite part
of Thanksgiving,
'cause I get to say
what I'm thankful for.
Do we have to hold hands
the whole time?
Yes, you do. OK, for me,
it's really all about family.
And I'm not talking about just blood,
because it's bigger than that.
Family is about all the people
that you choose to let into your life.
Family is about support
and working through things.
Even though you can care so much,
you can scream and fight
just as easily as you can make love...
Yeah, good, good call.
Um, anyway, I'm just really thankful
that you're all a part of my life. I am.
I love you guys.
- Let's eat.
- Yay!
- Are you gonna tell me yet?
- No. I can't.
It's fine. I can wait.
Oh, God, just release this pressure.
Is it about Grayson or Bobby?
Oh! Don't, don't, don't, don't...
You'll break eventually.
Oh, just let me die!
Oh!
Oh, you're a cruel woman!
But I love you, dear.
