I've been searching
for a long time
To find someone to be mine
I never thought
you'd come along
Now that you're here
All my worries are gone
Oh, sweet you
Sweet you
All of my dreams
have all come true
You're just the one
I've been looking for
You're just the one
I've been looking for
I didn't know how long
it would take
But good things come
to those who wait
Now I can't ask for
any thing more
You're everything
I've been looking for
Sweet you
Sweet you
Nobody, nobody, nobody
will ever do
You're just the one
I've been looking for
You're just the one
I've been looking for
Nights were dark
Days got longer
My mind was weak
when my heart stayed strong
Then you came along
and rescued me
Please don't you ever
set me free
Oh, no
Sweet you
Sweet you
Nobody, nobody, nobody
will ever do
You're just the one
I've been looking for
You're just the one
I've been looking for
Nights were dark
Days got longer
My mind was weak
when my heart stayed strong
Then you came along
and rescued me
Please don't you ever
set me free
Oh, no
Synedyne technical support.
This is Suzanne. How can I help you ?
Synedyne technical support.
This is Rachel. How can I help you ?
This is Elliot.
How can I help you ?
Oh.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, okay.
Give me a second to find you here. My
computer's running a little slow today.
Wake up, fella.
Oh, there you are.
Hey, you got yourself a model 5732,
Good. Good. And you say that it hangs
every time you try and print ?
Wow. All right,
no problem.
Can you hold for two seconds ?
Carol! Carol.
I don't know what you've
been told, little lady,
but the rest of us start at 9:00.
I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.
Good morning.
Hey, Dan, my man !
What's up, my bro ?
Put it there.
All right. Yeah.
So, hoops today ? You and the guys
up for some hoopage after work ?
Uh, you know, we don't know yet,
Elliot. I'm not sure yet, okay ?
Oh, that's cool, man.
Just let me know, 'cause I'm there, bud.
,Cause I love the round ball.
That's why they call me "Air Elliot."
-
- Okay.
Well, you know, make sure
that you let me know the right time,
,cause last week you said 6:30, and when
I got there you guys were just leaving.
- How stupid did you feel ?
- Pretty stupid, Elliot.
Not a problem, Danny.
Give it up.
-  Hey, Daniel.
- Hey, man, how you doing ?
Hey, Bob.
- What's up ?
- Hey, Elliot.
So, uh, you and your posse
gonna hit the brewery tonight ?
My posse ? No.
Uh, they're all busy
with the big, uh--
- What's wrong with your neck ?
- Uh, nothing.
It's repetitive stress disorder.
It's a headset injury. What do
you say you and me go knock back
suds and check out the babes ?
Elliot, I'm married, remember ?
- I'm gonna go home and spend
some time with my wife.
- Ohhh.
Taking a trip to Whipville.
Oooh.
That just gets funnier
every time you do that.
- Don't-Don't-Don't--
-  Hey, Jerry !
Jerry, Jerry, bo-berry
Fee, fie, fo-ferry, Jerry
- What's happening, brother ?
- Uh, running to an important meeting.
Oh, yeah ? I think you're gonna
appreciate this 'cause we're
both stereo component nuts.
- Check these out, homes.
These are the new Ingebritzens.
- Right.
XVC speakers. Here, look it.
That's the back of the left speaker.
- And here's the front
of the right speaker.
- Sweet, sweet.
That's the front of the left--
No, that's the right speaker.
- I think-- Oh, man !
-  What ?
- It's Elliot.
Who told hi m we were here ?
- Oh !
Hi.
You guys.
Well, well, well,
isn't this a big surprise ?
I thought everybody was busy.
- Uh, slight change of plans, Elliot.
- Oh, is that right ?
Well, I'm a little bit
peeved at you guys.
I'm thinking you tried to
ditch me. I'm thinking I might
not even sit down with you.
- We can understand that.
See you tomorrow.
- Later, Elliot.
I'm kidding.
- Wanna switch places with me ?
- No, I'm fine.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
You've got to be kidding me.
Please, please don't tell me you have
a thing for Alison Gardner. Please.
You're way out of your league.
Plant life is
out of his-- Isn't she dating
that guy, uh, uh, in research ?
Brian, with the teeth--
Brad, Brian-- the guy with the teeth.
No, that's been over
for three months now.
- Oh, yeah ? How do you know ?
- I know a lot of things about her.
I know-- I know that she likes
her bagels buttered, but not toasted.
- Wow.
- How specific.
I know that she looks
beautiful in any color,
but when she wears blue--
-  Mm-mm-mm.
- Sounds like you guys are old friends.
Well, we have been working
at the same company for four years now.
You spend that much time together,
you get to know each other.
So it should be really no
problem for you to just get up,
walk over and say hello to her.
- She's with somebody.
I'll catch up with her tomorrow.
- Yeah. Oh !
Come on, Elliot.
Come clean here.
- You have never spoken
to Alison Gardner, right ?
- Of course I have.
- Did I say "queer" earlier ?
- Oh, you are pathetic, Elliot.
Really, you're pathetic.
Okay. I guess you guys are just
not gonna let me relax until
I go over there and say hello.
-
- Wow. That'll make you happy ?
You think I'm pathetic ?
- Don't touch me.
-  Go for it, tiger.
Good luck.
I'm gonna go.
See you later.
- Hi.
- Hi. Do I know you ?
Oh, I should hope so.
Uh, we've only been working together
at Synedyne for the last four years.
I'm Elliot Richards.
We-We've spoken.
I'm sorry. I -I don't--
It was the first week
of June three years ago.
I said it was "wet out."
We were standing in the lobby
and I said it was "really wet out."
- It was raining at the time.
- I assumed that.
Yeah.
So, here we are talking again.
Yeah.
Uh, well, take it easy.
You know, I'm here with some friends and
I was wondering if maybe you wanted to--
Dear God, I would give anything
to have that girl in my life.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Uh, I was wondering
if, uh, this is--
Uh, I was standing
over there and the--
You're very glib.
I bet you're a whiz with the ladies.
- Well--
- You here alone ?
No, uh, I'm here with
some buddies from work--
- I saw you talking to a woman.
- Um--
Yeah, yeah.
But... I'm not with her.
But you'd like to be, huh ?
- What makes you say that ?
- Oh, I don't know.
When a man says he'd give anything
to have a certain woman in his life,
I just assume
she means something to him.
How did you hear me say that ?
I was standing all the way over--
I have fantastic hearing, and a number
of other equally impressive talents.
Ho-doggie !
Let's go some place quiet
so we can talk.
Um, okay. You-- What ?
You wanna talk to me ?
Is that a problem ?
You're not attracted to me ?
Uh, no.
I think you're hot.
Baby, you have no idea.
- Kiss me.
- What ? Here ?
Don't be afraid
to explore new horizons.
Um--
Can you give us
two seconds, girls ?
Yeah, can you give us
two seconds ?
Sure. Whatever.
Listen. Whoo !
You seem really nice...
in a strong,
scary kind of a way.
But my friends are, uh,
probably waiting for me,
so, I'm-- I'm gonna
just get going.
You're so nervous, Elliot.
How do you know my name ?
I'm psychic.
Plus, it's on your name tag.
Duh.
Now, then, I just wanna
talk business for a second.
Oh, um, I'm not into that.
I mean, I -- I've never
paid for sex before.
Except this one time.
It was an Internet thing.
You can't help it. Every time
you sign on, it's sex, sex, sex.
I'm not a hooker, you silly boy.
I just wanna ask you a question.
How would you like to make
one simple decision...
that'll change
your life forever ?
Okay, I'm glad Scientology
works for you, but--
Just listen.
What if I told you that
I had the cataclysmic power...
to give you anything and everything
you've always dreamed of ?
- Who are you ?
- Promise not to tell anyone ?
Okay.
Cross your heart
and hope to die ?
Yeah.
I'm the Devil.
Okay.
I think somebody's had
"tee many martoonis."
I am the Devil, Satan, Lucifer,
Beelzebub, the Prince of Darkness.
Well, the Princess
of Darkness, anyway.
Here's my card.
Oh.
"The Devil." Yep.
That explains it.
Now I believe you.
Night-night.
-
- You're a very skeptical
person, you know that ?
How did you--
How did you just-- And you--
- What's--
- Look.
If you could just buy into
this whole "I'm the Devil" thing,
it'll save us both
a lot of these questions.
Maybe I should call you a cab.
Although it's gonna be hard to find one
that'll go to Hell this time of night.
Ooh, what a delightfully
piquant wit.
I can see we're gonna
get along famously.
Cheers, darling.
What are--
You can't-- Look at--
Geez !
You can't do that.
That's very dangerous.
Listen here. Why is this
so hard for you to believe ?
Do you think your mommy and daddy
just made me up so you'd be a good boy ?
Okay, okay, you're the Devil.
What do you want with me ?
I want you to be happy, Elliot.
You have such potential.
All you need is a little push
in the right direction.
- I am happy.
- Oh, please.
You don't have to lie to me.
I know every dark thought
in your tiny little mind.
I know that every night you go home
to your horrible little apartment...
and you eat your little
frozen dinner and you make
your little bowl of popcorn...
and you watch TV and you can't keep
your eyes open anymore.
And then you crawl
off to bed...
and wonder why you're alone
and nobody likes you.
- Not every night.
- And you cry.
Yeah, sure.
I know what's in your heart, Elliot.
You could cry right now.
I'm talking about reinvention.
Taking control of your destiny.
You wanna be liked ?
You wanna be loved ?
How about respected ?
How about feared ?
What exactly
are we talking about ?
You wanna see how it works, baby ?
Wish for something.
- Like what ?
- Whatever you want.
It's yours.
Just say the word.
Okay, I ...
wish I had a Big Mac
and a large Coke.
It is done.
Hi, how are you doing ?
What can I get you ?
- A Big Mac and a large Coke.
- Fries ?
- No.
- Comes to $3.47.
Do you have $3.47 ?
I left my purse
in the underworld.
Oh, yes ! This truly
is the work of the Devil.
And to think that I doubted you.
I'm gonna go now.
- What's the problem ?
- This doesn't prove anything !
I could have done this myself.
I even had to pay for it.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
Didn't anyone ever tell you that ?
- I didn't even get any fries !
- Oh, I don't believe this.
I'm offering you the opportunity
of a lifetime and all you can
do is moan about French fries ?
- Good night.
- Fine. Okay.
I'm obviously not getting through
to you, so let's just forget it.
Come. I'll give you
a lift back to your car.
That's your car ?
Hey, hey !
There's Elliot !
Elliot, right here.
Right here, Elliot.
Where are we ?
Just a little
after-hours club I own.
We better get in there.
Everyone's waiting for you.
- Everyone who ?
- All your friends.
How are you doing,
Mr. Richards ?
Hey, hey, Elliot.
- No way. This is your club ?
- Sure is.
Wow !
Elliot !
Hello, Elliot.
- Hello.
- Elliot, dance with me first.
- No, Elliot, dance with me.
- He's dancing with me first.
- You can dance with me.
-  That's enough.
Break it up. He belongs to me.
Hey, Elliot, how the hell
are you ? Somebody take
a picture of me and Elliot.
- Hold it.
- Excel lent.
- Hi, Elliot.
-  Ooh.
I think she likes you too.
- You hungry ?
- Sort of.
- Look.
- Wow. These look just like
the cookies my grandma used to bake.
- Try one.
- Okay.
- These are the cookies
my grandma used to bake !
- I aim to please, handsome.
- Come on.
- How did you--
- You liked that, didn't you ?
- What, the cookie ?
Having all those people
excited to see you.
It's nice to feel
accepted, isn't it ?
I can give you that.
I can make the
whole world love you.
- Come on.
- You still don't believe me.
- Do you ?
- Of course not.
First of all,
you look nothing like the Devil.
Oh, really ? I suppose
I could have gone this way.
-
- But it's so "trick or treat."
It's true.
You really are the Devil.
Oh. Come on, baby.
Come and sit down.
I know this has all been
horribly overwhelming for you.
- Can I ask you a question ?
- Sure you can.
You can ask me anything
you like, as long as you
don't ask me if there's a God.
I get that one all the time.
It drives me absolutely bonkers.
Yes, there's a God.
Really ?
Well, what's He like ?
You know, you'd think that meeting
the Devil would be interesting enough,
but no, all people
want to know about is Him.
Like He's so bloody fascinating.
- So, He's a man ?
- Yeah. Most men think they're God.
This one just happens
to be right.
Now listen, darling.
I don't wanna pressure you,
but why don't we take a teensy
little look at the contract ?
This is pretty-- Um--
" I, Elliot Richards,
hereafter known as the Damned--"
-"The Damned" ?
-How about "the Darned" ? Sound better ?
Don't get hung up on the language,
darling. There's nothing sinister here.
It's all standard boilerplate.
Paragraph one states that I, the Devil,
a not-for-profit cooperation...
with offices in Purgatory,
Hell and Los Angeles,
will give you seven wishes...
to use as you see fit.
Seven ?
Why not eight ?
Why not six ? I don't know.
Seven just sounds right.
Paragraph two outlines
the manner in which you'll pay
for the aforementioned wishes.
What ? Are you kidding ?
I have to give you my soul ?
- After you've had
your wishes, of course.
- But it's my soul !
- I can't give you my soul !
- What are you, James Brown ?
What's the big deal ?
Have you ever seen your soul ?
- Do you even know what it is ?
- Of course.
It's the thing that-- that--
No, that's the--
It floats around--
Can I tell you something ?
Souls are overrated.
They don't really do anything.
Has yours done anything for you so far ?
No. It's like your appendix.
You'll never even miss it.
Yeah, well, if it's so useless,
then how come you want it so much ?
Ooh, aren't you
the clever one ?
Look, who's really making out
on this deal here ?
Seven utterly fabulous wishes
for one piddling little soul ?
Well, I don't know.
What have we here ?
But who is that ? Alison ?
How did you--
She is so beautiful.
- I've been waiting for you for so long.
- Who's that ?
- Who's she with ?
- I want you now, my love.
- Why are you showing me this ?
- I'm yours forever, my darling.
-
- Oh, I love your hair like that.
You must go through
conditioner like crazy.
- Is this real ?
- It could be.
All you have
to do is sign.
- And you promise I'll get her ?
- It's really up to you.
You're the one with the wishes.
But I promise
I'll do everything in my power.
Sign it, Elliot.
Please, Elliot. I'm waiting.
-
- Great !
Now, before you start wishing,
you'll be needing this.
If for any reason your wish
isn't going the way you hoped,
just take out the pager,
hit 666...
and it'll bring you
right back to me.
Why wouldn't it go
the way that I'd hoped ?
Oh, I was just throwing
that out as a "for instance."
Every wish is gonna be
But you'll find that out
as soon as you make one.
So, I should make one now ?
Well, if you don't mind.
I've got places to go,
people to condemn
to an eternity of fiery torment.
Okay. Um, let me think.
- I wanna be married to Alison.
- You got it.
Um, that's not all.
I wanna be rich.
- Always a popular choice.
- That's not all.
I wanna be very rich
and very powerful.
Oh, even better.
Remember, you have to say "I wish."
Right.
I wish that I were married
to Alison...
and that I were very, very rich
and very powerful.
- How's that sound ?
- Sounds good to me.
Enjoy.
Que diablos !
- Bueno.
- Roberto.
Si.
Corazon. Corazon !
I am is to visiting
in the Los Angeles...
for the time of vacations.
Idiota !
Jefe.
Corazon.
Es cocaina !
Alejandro ?
-Alejandro ? Roberto ? Esteban ?
-
Seis, seis, seis.
-
- Back so soon ?
You turned me into a drug dealer.
They almost killed me.
- You asked for rich and powerful.
- Not like that.
Goes with the territory, babe.
Root of all evil. Ring any bells ?
-What about Alison ? What got into her ?
-I think it was Raoul.
Yeah ! That's not
what I wished for.
Well, hold on now, mister. You
wished that the two of you were married.
You didn't say anything
about her loving you.
Well, you know, when two people
get married, I assume that--
There's your mistake.
May I suggest something ?
- What ?
- The rich and powerful thing
wasn't really the way to go.
Everyone wishes for that first thing
out of the gate and it never pans out.
- Really ?
- The fact of the matter is...
women aren't really attracted
to wealth and power.
- They're not ?
- No, of course not.
They couldn't give a fig
for all that rubbish.
What you need to figure out
is what she does want in a man.
How do I find that out ?
Easy.
Easy.
I'm not with her !
- Where are we ?
-A place you never would
have seen without my help.
Welcome to Alison's bedroom.
-
- We can't be in here.
This is breaking and entering.
I know.
It's fun, isn't it ?
I'm sure we're gonna
find the answer somewhere around here.
- What if Alison catches us ?
- Don't worry.
She won't be able to see you.
- Besides, she's in the shower... naked.
-
Right behind that door.
Go on. Go ahead. Take a peep.
- No !
- Oh, come on. We both know you want to.
You must think that
I'm really perverted, don't you ?
That's what you think.
You think I'm some sad, desperate,
twisted, pathetic loser.
- Yes.
- Well, in that case, maybe
I'll just take a quick look.
Focus, Elliot. Remember, we're here
to find out what kind of man she wants.
- How are we gonna do that ?
- Well, she keeps a journal.
Aha. And here it is.
Right. I should be able to find some
information in here you'll find useful.
- Hey, that's private stuff.
- Is it ever. Listen to this.
" Last night was the most
incredible night of my life.
" I never did find out any of the guys'
names, but I brought them back here...
" and all five of them banged me
like a Salvation Army drum. "
- What ?
-Just kidding.
I could have been a writer.
Hey, it's okay. She could bump
into you and she wouldn't feel it.
Now, this is good.
" I meet many attractive men
who are interested in me,
" and while many of them are handsome
or clever or very successful,
" I find myself turning away
from them...
" and searching the horizon
for someone else.
" I don't know who he is
or where I'll find him.
" I only know that
he is a sensitive man.
" He's a man who is in touch
with his emotions.
" He's a man who's not afraid
to share his fears,
" his disappointments
and his tears.
Where are you,
my sensitive man ? "
Did you see that ?
She passed right through me.
We were one person for a split second,
just like in Ghost.
Darling, I've got an earthquake
in Chile in eight minutes.
Any chance of making a wish here ?
Yes. I wish...
I were the most
sensitive man in the world.
Right. Okay.
Wait ! I wish I were the most
emotionally sensitive man in the world.
Damn. I was hoping you wouldn't
catch that. I could have had
a lot of fun with that one.
- And I want her to love me.
- Oh. You know what ?
I have a great feeling
about this.
- You do ?
- Yeah, but... what do I know, right ?
- Hey.
- I'm back, my love.
- Where did you run off to ?
- I went to make
a garland of beach plums...
to place atop your glorious head
like a crown.
But then I caught sight
of that sunset and...
I don't know, something
stirred inside me...
and I had to stop and weep.
Mmm, it's beautiful.
It is.
- There I go again.
- Tissue ?
No, I never wipe
my tears away.
I'm not ashamed of them.
I wear them proudly,
like small, wet, salty
badges of emotional truth.
Elliot, um, there's something that
I think that we should talk about.
Um, we've been together for
what, about three weeks now ?
- Three magical weeks.
- Three magical weeks.
And I don't think that I've ever
met a man who's been more in touch...
- with his feelings.
- I love you... so very much.
I love you too.
-
- Dudley ! Peter !
I'm sorry.
They're such little devils.
Come on, you naughty boys.
See ya.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay ?
Um, do you need comforting
on any level ?
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Have I done or said anything to
make you feel less good about you ?
- No, no, no, I'm fine.
- Would you like something to eat ?
I made a salad nicoise
with dolphin-safe tuna.
Oh, wow.
- What is it ?
- It's that sunset again.
And I worry about the dolphins.
I wrote a song about them.
Would you like to hear it ?
Now ? I -I --
Mayo-nayo-naise
Swimming by the sandy shore
Dancing up among the waves
Dolphin, dolphin I adore
Everything you are
You're so much more
than a fish to me
My playful friend
beneath the sea
- I have to stop.
- Good ! I mean, oh, why ?
Because I'm looking at you
and I'm seeing all the beauty...
of the world shining at me
through your eyes.
- Would you mind if I sketched you ?
- I didn't know you could draw.
I'm not an artist, perse.
Okay, Elliot, there's something
that I think I really have to say.
Elliot, that's amazing !
Compared to you, it's nothing.
Compared to your smile...
and the blush of your cheek and
the sound of your voice as it
floats on the evening breeze.
Compared to you,
that sunset's just--
When is that darn thing gonna set ?
- Maybe we should go.
- No, wait.
There's so much that I wanna say to you,
but I just can't find the words.
I have an idea.
I would like...
to improvise a sonnet
about your hair.
How wonderful
my fair one's face--
Excuse me, fellas.
Might I ask you to...
take the horseplay down
to another part of the beach ?
Uh, no.
You know, rather
than get confrontational,
why don't we all
just sit down together,
have some salad with dolphin-safe tuna
and see if we can't start a dialogue.
You know, I had a feeling
that you were gonna--
Okay, guys, I'm afraid
I'm going to have to ask you...
to respect the moment that
my woman friend and I are sharing...
because it's a special celebration
of love and caring...
and a unique spiritual
and emotional understanding.
- You wanna get a beer ?
- Sure.
Alison, excuse me, but I thought
that this was our time together.
It's just a beer.
I'll be back in two seconds.
Actually, my place
is like 40 minutes from here.
- That's fine. Which way is your car ?
- It's a van.
- Great.
- Alison, I respect your uniqueness
and individuality.
And you're your own person, and if you
want to go with our new friends here...
to get a drink,
I won't stand in your way.
- Okay, thanks, El.
I knew you'd understand.
- No, wait !
Don't go ! I can't handle this
kind of rejection ! Why don't
you wanna stay here with me ?
You wanna know why ?
Because you're just too sensitive !
I'm about to go out of my mind here.
It's been wonderful,
and God knows I love you,
but enough is enough !
I just wanna be with a man who will
ignore me and take me for granted...
and who's only pretending
to be interested in who I am...
and what I think so
he can get into my pants.
- That would be me.
- Oh, thank you !
Let's get out of here.
Alison, wait !
Alison !
I'll get into your pants !
Oh, Elliot, get out of there,
you silly boy.
- Oh, man, you are so bad.
- Why, thank you.
Just admit it. You're not
very good at this whole instant
travel thing, are you ?
I'm sorry. Now then,
what were we talking about ?
Oh, your next wish, wasn't it ?
Don't think I don't see what
you're doing. I make wishes,
you think up ways to ruin them.
I've ruined them ?
How can you say that ?
I'm not perfect, you know.
Do you think I enjoy this ?
I'm stuck in this horrible job
for eternity. Everybody hates me.
I can't sleep. And when
I actually try to help someone,
they turn on me like
I'm supposed to be God or something.
Well, for your information,
my life is a living hell.
I work hard.
I try to look good for you.
You do look good.
You-You look very good.
I just wanted you
to like me.
Oh, come on. I do like you. It's just
I'm feeling a little frustrated here.
Don't give up on me, Elliot.
I'm not giving up on you.
Nobody gets it totally right right away.
You're doing great, really.
- I am ?
- Yeah, you are.
I'm so sorry
your wish didn't work out.
Friends ?
Sure.
Listen, I'm sorry if I said anything
to upset you or make you feel bad.
And I'm gonna try
to be more sensitive next time.
- I think you're
sensitive enough already.
- You think ?
Are you kidding ?
You even went for me crying.
Hey ! Were you
just faking me out ?
I was 100% sincere. It's not easy
being the Barbra Streisand of Evil.
-
- Now, what have we learned so far ?
Well, let's see.
- I'm starting to think women
don't know what they want.
- Amen !
They say they want sensitivity, but
did you see how fast Alison went for...
- those tough-guy dudes on the beach ?
- Which tells you ?
That-- Well, it tells me
that I wanna be really big and strong.
You know, I wanna have a great body
and be tall and-- Like--
- Go on.
- And I wanna be athletic.
- Check.
- And I wanna be rich too.
But I want it to be
for something that I like doing,
and people really like me for.
Great ! This is getting
really specific.
Let's see--
big, strong, rich, athletic,
something you like,
lots of fans--
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking ?
- Oh, I hope so.
- In the form of a wish ?
- I wish I could play
professional basketball.
Then I'll just say
the magic words: Dennis Rodman.
-
-  No !
Just kidding.
Michael Jordan.
Yeah !
Three, two, one !
And that's it. That's the game.
The fans are going nuts
here at the Forum in Los Angeles.
The score: 135 to 85.
Elliot Richards has totally dominated.
If you're just tuning in,
it's a shame because you just missed...
one of the greatest performances
in the history of sports.
Absolutely, Jerry.
Absolutely.
People said basketball caught fire with
the "ascendry" of Michael Jordan.
But I tell you, after what
we seen here tonight,
a lot of people are gonna
be saying, "Michael who ?"
Right from the get-go, the
fans took a look at Elliot Richards...
and a couple women fainted.
And a couple fellas-- I'd rather not
say-- but they liked what they saw.
Absolutely.
He's a big fella and an imposing fella.
He's enormous. He's listed at 7'6"
in the program,
but I'd say he plays the game
like he's 11 feet tall.
No, I don't think
he that big, Jerry.
No, I'm saying the game
he plays is-is-is--
is that of
some Viking giant...
with a basketball in one hand
and a club in the other...
standing 10, 11 ,
It's obvious Elliot Richards controlled
this game right from the tip-off.
Right from the get-go, Elliot was
a dominating force in tonight's game.
He was PhiSlammaJamma
runnin' stank all over it. ..
with rib-ticklin' jumps
of double vanilla funk.
Let's take a look.
Here's a pass worthy of John Elway.
For the dunk !
Such a beautiful play.
Here he is lining up for the three.
And Ricola ! It's good!
Here comes his patented
over-the-shoulder,
no-look three-pointer.
And nothing but net !
They're in the zone.
Here he is soaring
through the air like the man...
on the flying "trapezius"
and bam !
That's what I'm talking about !
Destroying the backboard on the glass.
This kid's an animal.
-Let's take a look at that dunker again.
-It's boom !
Humpty-hump-dump-dump. Ha-ha !
I love this game, folks.
I sure enough do.
Elliot Richards
spitting glass at your ass.
Bob is courtside with Elliot Richards
now. Let's go to Bob Bob.
Thank you, Jerry and Dan.
Elliot, you must be one very
proud young man this evening.
Simply put, that was a staggeringly
dramatic display of athletic ability.
Uh, well, you know,
you go out there and you give 110%.
And you wanna play good.
And you hope you play good.
I think we played
pretty good tonight.
Well, in the lexicon
of sports terminology, and I
don't mean to sound contrary here,
the word "good" falls tragically
short of encompassing the sheer
virtuosity of your performance.
Um, well, you know, there's
no "I" in the word "team"
and this is a team effort.
And I just wanna say that I'm
real proud to be associated with...
these fine individuals that
I have the pleasure of working with.
Now, I would never wanna dis your
team mates in any way, shape or form,
but you do realize that you smashed
Wilt Chamberlain's unbreakable record...
of 100 points in a single
basketball game set in Hershey,
Pennsylvania, years ago ?
Man, you just gotta play one game at
a time and go out there and give 110%...
and you gotta show that you
want it more than they do when
the chips fall where they may.
Thank you very much.
Back to you, Jerry and Dan.
All right ! Diablos !
Number one ! Yeah !
Elliot. Hi.
Alison Gardner.
The Sporting News.
- Oh. It's nice to meet you, ma'am.
-
God, I can't tell you
how thrilled I am to meet you.
I was just wondering
if there was a possibility...
you might consider
doing something exclusive with me,
uh, for the magazine ?
Maybe more intimate,
one-on-one, just the two of us.
Yeah, right.
I'd kill you in one-on-one.
Shoot !
God, it's so exciting to be here.
I mean, uh, you must have
an enormously huge...
talent to do what you do.
Well, you know, you go out there
and you just give 110%.
And, uh, you hope you play good.
You wanna play good.
- I bet.
- I think we played pretty good tonight.
Oh, God, you were incredible tonight.
I mean, watching you,
I just kept thinking
how unbelievably big...
your, uh, ego must be
after a game like that.
Oh, not that big, really.
- I bet it's pretty big.
- Well, I guess a little bit bigger.
- It depends on how happy I am.
- Oh !
- Whoo. God.
- Heck.
Wanna go back to my place ?
I'll show you my bottle cap collection.
Oh, God, that would--
that would be tremendous.
- All right, well--
- God.
I should, uh--
I should get dressed.
                         54:19,084
I can't wait.
-  Oh, my God !
-
Hey, what the hell !
Oh, God, there's--
Hey ! Damn !
- Um--
- Oh, heck !
- Oh !
- I just remembered there's
just this teeny, tiny thing...
- I forgot to do.
- What's teeny ?
- No, no, no.
It's something I have to write.
- About me ?
Yeah, just a little, short,
itty-bitty blurb about tonight's game.
Well, uh, can I see you
after the road trip ?
I would love to, but I'm--
I'm working on a really big,
huge, enormous story on the N.F.L.,
so I probably won't have time.
Oh, shoot. I understand.
You gotta give 110%.
- Right.
- Stay within yourself.
Hey, oh, yeah.
Hey, um, thanks for your time.
So long. Oh--
What the hell ?
Oh, damn the Devil.
Damn the Devil to Hell !
Oh, shoot ! Darn it !
Where the heck did
I put that--
Five, five, five.
Seven, seven, seven.
Come on ! Oh !
Duh ! Six, six--
- Now what are you doing ?
- You seem so upset, Elliot.
Do you want something to relax ?
You bet I'm upset. You gave me,
like, this little teeny-weeny winkie.
Well, that's easily fixed,
you know. Now then, let's see.
Here's some M&Ms
for room 320.
- Red Hots for 316.
- You're giving them candy ?
Placebos. They work just as well as
the real thing. It's a scientific fact.
You can't give sick people
Tic Tacs !
Sick people have notoriously bad breath.
I'm performing a public service here.
Now then,
about your next wish.
All right, okay. Um--
Well, I wanna be smart.
No, I wanna be really smart.
And I wanna be able to talk good-- well.
- What is the word--
- "Articulate" ?
Articulate. Yeah.
I wanna be articulate.
And I wanna be witty
and sophisticated, charming.
I wanna know everything
about everything...
and I wanna be popular
and I wanna be good-looking.
No, no, make that
great-looking.
And I want Alison to fall absolutely
head over heels in love with me.
- Anything else ?
- Like what ?
Like winkie-wise ?
Oh, right. Um--
Yeah, well, um,
I wanna be--
I wanna be big.
Not like practical joke big,
but, you know, sort of--
Yeah, like that.
Is that clear ?
Crystal. You just say "I wish"
and I'll fill in the rest.
Okay.
I wish that I was witty
and articulate--
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
You've got it, smarty-pants.
Take two of these
and call me in the morning.
Oh, Elliot !
Oh, it so wonderful
to see you, darling.
Oh, New York has been so deadly dull
without you. Where have you been ?
Oh, out in the Hamptons, of course.
Up to my ears in my new book.
Another one ? You've written
four books in three years. My God.
- What's this one about ?
- Oh, same old, same old.
It's a critical deconstruction
of the Neo-Romantic period
in art and literature...
from the political
and economic perspective
of the Industrial Revolution.
I can't imagine
who reads this stuff !
Well, Elliot,
the critics, apparently.
It's already won the Pulitzer Prize
and it hasn't even been published yet.
Well, like they say,
Dr. Oingegedaydegegedaybaba,
a Pulitzer Prize and $3.50
will get you a cafe latte.
So modest. Darling, you really should
get around. Everyone's dying to see you.
Mingle.
Oh, darling, you look fabulous.
Badgely Mishka ?
- What a charming man. Who is that ?
- Oh, that's Elliot Richards.
He's a very successful writer.
He's a very successful everything,
as a matter of fact.
That's Elliot Richards ?
Oh, I've read all his books.
He's brilliant.
I had no idea he was so handsome.
Well, why don't you
go over and talk to him ?
- I couldn't. What would I say ?
- I wouldn't worry about that.
Just, uh, let him
do all the talking.
It's a common misapprehension that the
word "gin" comes from the city Geneva.
Actually, the word "geneva" --
small "g" --
is a corruption of genievre, which
of course is French for "juniper"
the wonderful berry that flavors
this miraculous libation.
Speaking of miraculous.
I'm Elliot Richards.
How do you do ?
I know who you are.
I'm Alison Gardner.
I just had to tell you how much
I loved your novel Always Toujours.
Well, I was just trying
to make a simple point really.
Every time I've reread
Camus and Sartre,
I kept thinking to myself,
"Why does the existential dilemma
have to be so damn bleak ?"
- Yes.
- Yes, we're alone in the universe.
Yes, life is meaningless,
death is inevitable.
But is that necessarily
so depressing ?
I couldn't agree more.
Don't you think
that secular humanism is yummy ?
Ooh, delish.
My, my.
They say that alcohol
is a disinhibitor and it seems
to be working very well on me.
Me too.
What an exquisite feeling.
Every cell in my body just wants
to reach out and touch someone.
Yes, it's incredible, isn't it ?
Mm-hmm.
Thyphysiology of touch.
Just below your epidermis,
concentrated in your fingertips,
the palms of your hands,
the soles of your feet,
the clitoris, nipples, penis,
lips, tongue.
Thousands and thousands of tiny
little Meissner's corpuscles...
all deliciously sensitive
to even the slightest caress...
sending all those tiny little
endorphin-producing pleasure messages...
to the hypothalamus--
the primitive brain.
I'm tingling all over.
Do you know the largest organ
in the human body ?
I can guess.
You'd be wrong.
It's your integumentary system.
Your...
creamy...
soft...
and completely desirable skin.
- Can we go to your place ?
- Mais certainment.
Oh, this is so perfect.
Everything here
absolutely screams...
"Elliot Richards."
Actually, most of the screaming...
takes place...
in the bedroom.
-
- What the hell is going on, Mary ?
-Who are you ?
-Don't play games with me, Mr. Richards.
I'm in no mood.
I've been out of my mind all night.
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.
Who's your little friend ?
- Maybe I should be running along.
- Wait. This is a mistake. I'm not gay.
Oh, really ?
And I'm Tony Danza !
- Honestly, I swear it. I'm not.
- Then tell me,
who was in the Broadway cast
of The Pajama Game ?
Janis Paige, John Raitt,
Eddy Foy, Jr.
I assume you mean the original cast
because there was a revival
in 1973 that starred...
Hal Linden and Barbara McNair--
I am gay !
- I rest my case.
-  Wait.
I can prove to you
that I am not gay. Kiss me.
Oh ! This is just sad!
Will you shut up, bitch !
Please, Alison, let me kiss you.
Remember the champagne
and the corpuscles ?
All right, Elliot, kiss me.
I'm gay. Well, thanks
for dropping by.
- Good night.
- All right.
Bu-bye.
You've been drinking again,
haven't you ?
This is like the night you had
all those Brandy Alexanders and
ran up and down Fire Island...
with your cute little Speedos
singing "Evergreen."
And so the cow was returned
to its rightful owner.
- Okay, boys, tonight's homework.
-
Algebra. "X" to the nth plus "Y"
to the nth equals "Z" to the nth.
You're never gonna
use that, are you ?
"Imperialism and the First World War."
Well, what's done is done, I say.
No point in thinking about it now.
"German, French, Spanish."
Ja, ja. Oui, oui.
Si, si. It's nonsense.
Everyone speaks English anyway.
And if they don't, they ought to.
So, no homework tonight.
But I want you to watch
a lot of television, don't
neglect your video games...
and I'll see you in the morning,
shall we say, 10:00, 10:30 ?
No point in getting up
too early, is there ?
Elliot, darling.
What a lovely surprise.
- I hope you had a pleasant evening.
- As if you didn't know.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling. I know it
must be really frustrating for you.
- I'll make it up to you somehow.
- Oh, yeah, you've been
a really big help so far.
I know. I've been
really naughty, haven't I ?
Maybe a good spanking's in order.
Is that all you ever think about ?
Do you think everything is about sex ?
No, of course not.
I mean, there's greed, gluttony,
sloth, anger, vanity, envy.
No, there's also honesty
and hard work...
and caring about people and
doing good for somebody else.
Oh. You're just
a big Boy Scout, aren't you ?
I find that
incredibly appealing.
No ! All I've been doing
is thinking about myself.
I could be doing all these really
important things to help other people.
- What about Alison ?
- Oh, I don't know anymore.
You mess it up anyway. I know that
Alison's not really like that.
What exactly do you
have in mind ?
I wanna do something
great for mankind.
I wanna help create
a better world.
I wanna go down in history for doing
something really, really important...
and I want Alison to take me really
seriously and to treat me with respect.
I sense a wish coming on.
Yes !
I wish that I was the President
of the United States.
That is the noblest,
most unselfish thing I've ever heard.
And it's a great way
to meet girls.
Bless you, Elliot Richards,
and Godspeed.
Mr. President. Alison Gardner.
We're so honored
to have you here, sir.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.
The actors are beside themselves
with excitement.
We're going to a play ?
I think you'll find it
quite amusing.
It's called Our American Cousin.
I think I've already seen it.
As a matter of fact, I'm sure I have.
I don't think you've seen it, sir.
It's an entirely new play.
Really ? I think I know
how it ends, anyway.
- Can't we just go to a movie ?
- A what ?
-  The President !
-
You seem tense tonight,
Mr. President.
Oh, well, you know,
I have a lot on my mind,
what, with preserving the Union
and my wife going crazy and all.
Can I help you find something,
Mr. President ?
Yeah, I'm looking
for my pager.
- Your what, sir ?
- My pager. It's this...
little red plastic thingy.
Looks kind of like
a cell phone, only smaller.
-
- I'm sorry ! Sorry !
Ha ! Ha ! All right.
No problem. No problem !
No problem ! No problem.
Sicsemper tyrannis !
Wait !
Okay.
-
-
-
-
- You're late, Richards.
- Uh, yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again.
See that it doesn't. I don't think
a person with your extremely limited...
personal and professional skills
can afford to push the envelope.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- Creep.
-
So, tell me, how was it ?
I'm dying to know.
What are you doing here ?
Just think of me
as a computer virus.
I think of you as a plague.
Now, will you get off
my screen ? I have work to do.
Whoa. What's this whole
"get thee behind me" thing ?
We still have business
here, Mr. Richards.
No, not now.
I told you, I've got work to do.
And besides, I've only got two wishes
left and I don't wanna screw 'em up.
Correction.
You have one wish left.
Nice try.
I've got two more coming.
Nuh-uh. Count 'em, baby.
- You were President
of the United States.
- Yeah, okay, one.
You were a charming, handsome,
articulate, celebrated author
and raconteur.
Uh-huh, yeah. And you turned me
into a flaming homosexual.
- Professional basketball player.
- Three.
The sensitive, caring,
artistic guy was four.
And the Columbian drug lord was five.
That means I have two more coming.
You forgot the Big Mac
and Coke.
What ? That wasn't a wish.
What do you call it ? You said,
"I wish" and I got it for you.
Sounds like a wish to me.
No ! No, no, no.
No, that's not fair !
Fair ? Who do you think
you're talking to ?
I don't recall anybody ever
accusing me of being fair before.
- I think I'm insulted.
- What ? No, this isn't right.
You can't do this.
Well, what are you gonna
do about it ? Sue me ?
No, that's it ! I've had it with you.
The whole deal is off.
Off!
Shut up !
Are you all right ?
Uh, not really.
Uh--
I need to talk to God.
That's the power of prayer. Just say
what's in your heart and He hears.
No, you don't understand.
I really need to talk to Him now.
- It's urgent.
- Is it something you could tell me ?
Um, no, it's personal.
There's nothing you could say
that I wouldn't understand.
Um--
Why don't you just try me ?
Okay, a few days ago I sold my soul
to the Devil for seven wishes.
I've already had five of them,
but the Devil says I've had six,
but I'm not counting
the Big Mac and Coke and she is
and I don't think that's fair.
Do you ?
- This is so unnecessary.
- You're coming downtown with us.
- I'm telling you, the Devil
gypped me for a ham burger !
- Tell your story to the sergeant.
So, do you have
a copy of this contract ?
No. I told you,
she keeps it in her office.
- At this nightclub in Oakland ?
- Yes, at a nightclub,
and no I can't tell you
where it is.
Because you promised
the Devil you wouldn't ?
No, because she drove,
that's why !
Right, in a Lamborghini Diablo.
- Look, Officer--
- Sergeant.
Sergeant, I know my rights. I don't
have to talk to you without a lawyer.
So, you either book me
or you let me go.
Gee, are those my choices ?
Oh, what do I do, what do I do ?
I choose "book you."
Throw him in the lockup.
- Arraignment in the morning.
Drunk and disorderly.
- What ? Hey !
- Recommending psychiatric evaluation.
- It's her ! She's the Devil !
One more word out of you and I'll pop
you one, you goddamn wacko bastard.
Now, move it.
Spread 'em.
There's no point
fighting about this.
You have to learn
to accept the inevitable.
We're all doomed anyway, so you might
as well just get with the program,
wish your way out of here
and move on.
I wasn't kidding when I said
I liked you. I do, Elliot.
I think you have
massive potential.
If you're looking
at an eternity in Hell,
let me tell you, it wouldn't hurt
to have a friend like me.
So you just think about that
and give me a call when you're ready.
She's the devil, that one.
What ?
I said, she's the devil,
that lady cop.
Oh.
Yeah, I guess.
- So, what you in for, brother ?
- Eternity.
Ooh. That's a long time.
You must've did
some really bad shit.
Yeah.
I sold my soul.
Hope you got something
good for it.
As a matter of fact,
I got nothing for it.
That's a really bad deal,
if you ask me.
I'm not asking you.
Doesn't really matter, though.
- You can't sell your soul, anyway.
- Oh, really ?
Why do you say that ?
Doesn't really belong to you
in the first place. No way, no how.
So, who does it belong to ?
It belongs to God,
that universal spirit that animates
and binds all things in existence.
The Devil gonna
try to confuse you.
But that's her gig.
But in the end, you're gonna see
clear to who and what you are
and what you're here to do.
Now, you're gonna make some mistakes
along the way. Everybody does.
But if you just open up
your heart. ..
and open up your mind,
you'll get it.
Who are you ?
Just a friend, brother.
Just a really good friend.
Elliot ! Elliot !
You the man, Elliot !
Elliot, darling.
So nice of you to drop by.
- Come into my office.
-
Oh, don't worry about them, darling.
They're having a fabulous time.
Pathetic, aren't they ?
Everybody wants to go to the party,
but nobody wants to pay the piper.
- Are you--
- Don't get too excited.
It's just a Halloween costume.
Anyway, Elliot, my darling,
have you thought of your last wish ?
- No.
- I hate to put a rush on this,
but there is a time limit.
Read your contract.
I really don't want another wish.
That's funny.
Do you think this halo's too much ?
No. I really don't want it.
What do you mean, you don't want it ?
You get seven wishes.
There's nothing I want.
Well, there are things
that I want,
but nothing
that you can give me.
What is that supposed to mean ?
Well, um,
last night when I was lying in jail,
I was talking to this guy,
I realized that wishing
just doesn't work.
All my life I wished
to be better looking,
to be richer, to be successful,
talented, whatever.
And I always thought,
"Wouldn't it be great if someone
could just wave a magic wand...
and make that happen.,,
Well, I realized that
it doesn't work by magic.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
I've been starting
to think that...
it really isn't that important
how far we go in life anyway.
It's how we get there
that really matters.
Oh.
Do you know,
that is so inspiring.
So, it's okay ?
Well, no, Elliot.
I'm afraid it's not okay.
A deal's a deal. You get
one more wish and I get your soul.
So, let's just get on
with it, shall we ?
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Oh, really ?
Well, before you get all hinky,
I think I should warn you,
I'm not all peaches
and cream, you know.
I do have a darker side,
and believe me, it's not pretty.
Now, you can go easy
or you can go hard,
but one way or another
I will get your soul !
I'm not gonna do it.
There's nothing that you can
say or do that will make me.
Oh, I think you'll
change your mind.
I'm just gonna slip into something
a little more terrifying.
See you in Hell !
-
-
-
- Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute ! Wait !
Wait !
Now listen to me,
you disgusting little maggot !
This is your last chance
before the big weenie roast.
Make a wish or
forever burn in Hell !
Okay ! Okay !
I wish--
I wish that Alison
has a happy life.
Oh, God.
- Is this Heaven ?
- Heaven ? God, no, it's the courthouse.
I'm just meeting a couple of lawyers
for lunch-- clients of mine. Come on.
Well, wait.
What happened to the whole...
you know, fire and
the big horny guy with the--
Oh, just a few special effects.
Sort of the Universal Studios
Tour of Evil.
Normally it works pretty well,
but evidently you weren't going for it.
- That last wish of yours
was a deal breaker.
- What ?
Nobody ever reads the contract.
Article 147, paragraph 9, subsection 3:
"Selfless Acts of Redemption."
- Huh ?
- Basically, it says...
if you commit one truly benevolent act,
it voids the contract.
- So I get to keep my soul ?
- Yes, you get to keep your soul.
Yes ! Oh, yes !
Yes, I get to keep my soul !
Whoo ! Hoo !
Hoo !
On November 16, I'll have
been doing this for 6,000 years...
and you're the first person
to give away one of their wishes.
I hope it's not the beginning
of a trend. You're not gonna
tell anyone, are you ?
No, no, I promise. Nope.
I don't get it, though.
I mean, why are you... being nice ?
Look, Elliot, I'm gonna
let you in on a little secret.
The whole good and evil thing,
you know, Him and me,
it really comes down to you.
You don't have to look
very hard for Heaven and Hell.
They're right here on Earth.
You make the choice.
And I guess
you just made yours.
So, I can go now ?
Unless you want
another seven wishes.
No thanks.
I didn't think so.
I really liked you, you know.
Well, to tell you the truth,
you've been the best friend
I've ever had.
Oh, dear.
Don't go gushy on me now.
Go on. Go.
You'll scare the fish away.
Alison. Hi.
Hi. Oh, uh--
Elliot Richards.
We've met a couple of times.
Yeah, I remember.
Hi. How are you ?
I'm great. I'm exaggerating.
I'm-- I'm good.
Um, the thing is we've been working
together here for the last four years,
and I've always noticed you
and thought that...
you looked like, um,
a very interesting person.
I don't know
how interesting I am.
Well, the truth is I don't know you
and you don't know me,
and I was thinking that if we were
to get to know each other that...
there's a chance that
we just might hit it off.
So I was wondering if you wanted
to go get a cup of coffee or--
That's really so nice of you.
I'm seeing someone.
Oh.
Well, of course you are. You're--
He's sure one lucky guy.
Uh, listen, if it ever doesn't
work out with him, then--
- That is so nice of you. Okay.
- No, thanks a lot.
- I'll see you around.
- Okay, take care. Bye.
- It's a joke.
- Right.
What's he gonna--
Hey, Elliot, fo-felliot,
so-smElliot.
What's up, dudester ? Yeah.
What do you say we go down
to the club tonight and we,
uh, pick up some chickettes ?
Nice talking to you, Bob.
- Hey.
- New neighbors ?
Guess so.
Hi. Oh, hi.
Hi. You must be
the boy next door.
Do you wanna give me a hand ?
Habla ingles ?
Sprechen Sie English ?
Parlez vous Americano ?
- Hi. I'm Elliot Richards.
- Hey. Nicole DeLarusso.
Don't call me Nicky, though.
'cause everyone always calls me "Nicky."
It starts off as Nicole,
then it becomes Nicky,
then Nick, then Ni, then just "Nn."
People just call me "Nn."
I'm cracking myself up here.
- Hey, do you wanna give me a hand ?
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.
- Oh, wow. You got the new Ingebritzens.
- Oh, yeah, they're the best.
- They're the best.
Um, so listen, I'd be happy
to hook these up for you...
so you could have some music
if you wanted, you know,
while you're unpacking.
I could make us some dinner.
That way you wouldn't have to cook.
Yeah, right.
Me cook.
Thank you.
Say, Nicole, you wouldn't happen
to have a sister, would you ?
No, no. I have a lot
of brothers, though.
Hey, hey, did you ever think
there might be another way
To just feel better
To just feel better about today
Oh, no, if you never wanna
have to turn and go away
You might feel better
You might feel better if you stay
Yeah, yeah
I bet you haven't heard
a word I've said
Yeah, yeah
You've had enough
of all your trying
Just give up
the state of mind you're in
If you wanna
be somebody else

With yourself
If you wanna

Or thanked the sun
