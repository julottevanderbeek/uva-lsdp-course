No.
Maybe.
I think so.
Fever
Charlotte,
We're Jewish.
What is this?
Cheese ball pick-me-ups
accompanied by miniature franks,
and, for dessert...
marshmallow kabobs.
It's Fred.
Okay, how do I look?
Like a woman
about to go forth and sin.
Oh, good,
exactly the look
I was hoping for.
- Good night.
- Don't wait up.
It all began with just
one little dance
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait.
Did you just tell me that
not only am I not going
on this trip,
but that you're taking
another woman?
Honey, she's not
just "another woman."
She's my wife.
The lightning
of his terrible, swift sword
His truth is marching on
Glory, Glory
Hallelujah
Frankenstein and birds?
No, sweetheart.
The three wise men
brought the baby Jesus
Frankincense and Myrrh.
Oh.
It's not that I don't know about these things.
I choose to believe something else.
- Yeah.
I can't do anything...
until I have everything the way it was.
The whole point of moving is so
that everything can be different.
I don't like waking up
and not knowing where I am.
Well, then I'll make you a little sign
for over your bed that says:
"Good morning, Charlotte.
You are now in East Port.
Have a lovely day."
Oklahoma was great.
I liked living there.
I know.
And you'll love living here
when you get used to it.
Yeah,
and when you get used to it,
we'll move...
Life is change, Charlotte.
Death is...
dwelling on the past or staying
in one place too long.
- I don't want any.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Every woman wants new shoes.
- But those are from him.
Charlotte says he'll visit one day.
How will he know we're here?
Charlotte, you know what?
The only thing you can rely on
about your father...
is that he can't be relied on.
- Hello there.
- Hello.
- Hey!
-
Somehow--
Charlotte, you drive like old people make love.
- Mom, I'm only 15. I get nervous.
- Move it over!
Driving happens to be one of the two
most important skills a woman can have.
You should be tickled pink
that I taught you early.
- Let's go!
- All right, this sounds good.
"Bright, personable young secretary
with cheerful disposition...
required by small law firm."
Why are you signaling?
The turn is two miles down the road.
- Just pull over.
- Step on it!
- Blow it out your ear!
- Kate--
Hi.
I just wondered
if you got moved in all right.
Yeah,
we got moved in fine.
My name's Joe Peretti.
I work up the hill.
So if you need anything done,
Ma'am--
"Ma'am"?
Well, what exactly is up the hill,
Mr. Peretti?
I suppose you think
this is divine providence?
- That porch swing up there?
- Yeah?
I just can't seem to reach it.
Okay. I'll take a look.
So, Joe, how old
did you say you were?
Twenty-six
and cute as a button.
Too bad you're set
on being a nun.
You know, Charlotte,
you might be old enough
for a boyfriend now.
If I'm old enough,
maybe you're too old.
Don't be ridiculous.
A real woman is never too old.
let's go! Let's go!
Come on.
Mrs. Flax...
I expect you to be here
when I return.
How are
those depositions coming?
They'll be ready.
Assholes.
- Do you like your new boss, Mom?
- No, sweetheart, I don't.
- You make out the list?
- Yeah. Kate needs a new swimsuit.
I need notebooks, pens
and underwear.
I only have a half an hour for lunch,
so after we pick out the shoes,
- Then I'll give you money and you can buy the rest.
- Okay.
- I want red ones.
- All right.
- Bright red ones with a red strap.
- Yes, Katie.
- I don't need any.
- Charlotte, don't aggravate me.
You're starting a new school on monday
and those boots aren't.
- What's wrong with them?
- Everything!
Because I'm the best mother in the world.
I'll be right with you.
You must be Mrs. Flax.
Joseph told us that a nice
Jewish family were our new neighbors.
Welcome to East Port.
You're still a perfect seven,
Reverend Mother.
You know,
most women's feet get bigger.
- Your feet swell.
When you get pregnant,
your feet swell.
Mother,
how could you say that?
She's a holy vessel.
- Thank you.
I used to live
in South Dakota myself.
Can you imagine trying
to keep Kosher in South Dakota?
I can't imagine trying
to keep Kosher anywhere.
Yeah.
Will that be all, Reverend Mother?
Only one new addition?
Every year, fewer and fewer of us now.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Flax.
I hope you enjoy living in East Port.
- Yes, dear?
Well, good-bye.
Oh!
She's got a pair that she likes.
What about you?
I don't need any shoes.
Thank you.
Nice boots.
- Maybe I'll see you at the Parent & Teachers' Night.
- Maybe you will.
Oh... Good.
Yeah.
I'd like that.
Yeah.
Come on, Miss Katydid, we're
gonna be late for registration.
- Bye, Sergeant.
- Bye, Fish-Head.
Well, look who's driving
the school bus.
Why, Miss Charlotte,
I do believe you're blushing.
Mary,
I'll throw up all over.
So... How was your date
with Scott Jones, Mary?
- He's an animal.
- Does that mean you had a good time?
We had oral sex
by the old railroad trestle.
- You're gonna get into a heap of trouble.
- I know. I can't wait.
Girls.
- Sorry, Mrs. Crain.
- Noree?
Class, we have a new student today.
Charlotte Flax.
Charlotte.
Charlotte, right down there.
Charlotte Flax,
Right?
- Here.
Bye.
So how do you like the house?
Sorry?
- I was born there.
You were?
Under the kitchen table.
Um... So was that you who carved
"Red Sox" on the door?
That used to be my room.
I didn't care about anything
anymore, not even the Red Sox.
That will be Carrie.
She sells cosmetics.
Oh...
She's gonna love my Mom.
Okay.
I was wondering,
what do people do here on the weekends?
Sunday's my day off.
Sometimes I go fishing.
Really?
I love to fish.
Well, sometimes I just
sit by the water and think.
That sounds great too.
Maybe you and your sister--
Oh, well, um...
Kate's actually scared
of the water,
- Oh.
I drive right by here
on my way to the cliffs, so--
What time?
Seven.
Okay, that sounds great.
Okay, I'll wait for you.
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
Know your colors
and know your fabrics.
That's what I tell
all my little girls.
Honey, I would kill
to have your hair.
Swimming's fine for your figure,
but it can damage your hair.
Got anything
for Sharks and Jellyfish?
- What, dear?
- She means body grease.
Miss Kate's going to swim
the English Channel one day.
Oh. Well, I'm not sure
I have exactly what
you're looking for,
but try this.
It was meant for crow's feet,
but never really caught on.
You are finished.
Now, why don't you
try the other side?
Tell me about that Caretaker,
the one at the convent.
No one could touch him
on a football field.
Then in the middle
of his senior year, he lost it.
His girlfriend had just
left town kind of sudden.
If I wasn't married
to a real son of a gun,
I'd go after him myself.
You have
very special eyes.
Only you and Liz Taylor can
get away with those eyebrows.
Let's put some color on you.
This one's planning
on being a nun.
You never came
to Parent & Teacher Night before.
I don't see what's
so special about this one.
Charlotte, you read
the invitation.
"Community begins
in the classroom."
I am your mother.
It is my job...
There's so little of it left.
What took you so long?
Ooh, we're gonna play my favorite game.
Who's the worst mother in the world?
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
Who could it be?
Could it be
- Who's that?
- That's Mr. Crain.
- He's my history teacher, and he's very nice.
- He is an asshole.
Charlotte,
I don't need to speak to him.
He's driving an Edsel,
for Chrissake.
We don't have a prayer against
Stockton's little league
if you don't release him--
Some agendas here and there's
some refreshments in, um--
Uh... Mrs. Flax, hi.
I'm glad you came tonight.
You have two weeks.
I'm asking for one day.
- Thanks, Coach.
- Hi, Mr. Landsky.
- Hi. How are you? Is your mom here?
Yeah.
Right over there.
Hi.
- How are you?
- Good. Even better now.
- Excuse me. - Sorry.
Any of these yours?
Oh, no, mine are grown
and long gone.
- Hi. Fine.
And where's
Mrs. Landsky tonight?
She's long gone too.
Oh, so you're a widower man?
Oh, no.
She's just gone.
Oh.
- Would you like some punch?
- Sure.
This way.
She just up
and left one day...
right in the middle
of vacuuming.
She didn't even switch
the damn thing off.
No. He, too,
made a rather sudden
and unexpected departure.
- Not in the middle of vacuuming?
- No, I was in the middle of labor with Charlotte.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, and to add insult to injury,
the son of a bitch
stole my car to leave in.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it was a great car:
Red Buick convertible,
white sidewall tires.
When I think about it,
it still pisses me off.
It's kind of obvious
it really means a lot to you.
I remember the first time
I got behind the wheel
of that car.
I thought,
"Rachel, this is heaven."
Cars mean freedom.
If you hate a place,
you can get in your car,
Poof, you're gone.
- So your first love was a Buick?
- Yeah, before I met my husband.
Big mistake.
One of many.
Are we talking
cars or men?
I don't know.
I've been taken for a ride
by both of them.
- Mrs. Flax.
- Yes, Mr. Landsky.
I, uh--
I try not to get involved with women
when the World Series is about to start,
but, for you,
I'd make an exception.
Should I take that
as a compliment?
Oh, yes. I would really like
to know you a whole lot better.
So call me Lou.
So, Lou, call me.
How about Sunday?
I'm free all day.
- How about breakfast?
- Great.
I'll bring bagels.
- I'll be there.
- So will I.
You see that woman there?
Mary... You already are.
It's after 7:00, Charlotte.
He's late.
When a man's late, it's time
to clear the decks.
- No!
- What?
Forget it. Never mind.
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.
Or don't do anything I would.
Rachel Flax.
My speedometer's broken.
I'm trying not
to drive too fast.
After my Mom,
nothing seems fast.
She seems like a nice person.
Oh, yeah... She is...
and a wonderful Mom.
My whole life I never saw
anybody treat a bagel this way.
Where were you raised?
Believe it or not,
my parents owned
a kosher bakery.
Yeah, they made me crazy,
of course.
The night I ran away from home,
I stood in the kitchen,
Cigarette in one hand,
ham sandwich in another.
- Why were you running away?
- I had my high school diploma,
my first paycheck,
why would I stay?
- Hi. Bye.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, honey.
- Bye. Mr. Landsky.
Bye.
Where did you meet
your husband?
In a writing class.
He liked my poems.
Must have been tough times
when he left,
I coped.
Um...
Who was Kate's father?
Are you always this nosy?
No.
Small-town boy.
I like to know
other people's business.
Do you mind?
No. When I mind,
you'll know I mind.
It's kind of obvious.
So who was he?
Well, actually,
I never caught his name.
He came to Saint Louis
for a Swim Meet.
- If he won, he was headed for the Olympics.
- You were on the same team?
No, I was the maid
in his hotel.
You're a hell of a woman,
Rachel.
I know.
- Gosh, it's been a memorable breakfast.
- I'm glad you liked it.
I didn't say I liked it.
I'm never going to forget it.
- Oh, I'm sorry. No offense.
- None taken.
Uh... Okay.
Uh, you, uh--
What you want to do?
We got all day.
You want to go out
someplace?
Do you want
to go out someplace?
Not really.  No.
Do you want to go out someplace?
No, I'm fine.
So, Joe, tell me about
the nuns in the convent.
Do they wear underwear
in the shower?
I'm too embarrassed
to take a shower after gym.
Mary O'brien
dances around naked,
screaming about her boyfriend's
quivering loins.
The boat's down there.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.
Come on.
Do you want
to bait your own hook
or do you want me to do it?
- You're a sexy guy.
You have to look surprised
when you say that?
- I am surprised.
- Oh.
Sometimes age
has its compensations.
I wouldn't go
that far.
It's been a while
since I've felt this good.
Don't spoil it.
- How long?
- Too long.
- No.
You're lying.
- Trust me. I know about these things.
- Okay.
- I don't care.
Look,
in my experience--
- Which, we've established, is considerable.
- Yes.
- Men lie about everything.
- But women don't.
I don't know about "women,"
but I don't.
- But from me you expect it.
- Absolutely.
When you expect
the worse from people,
they usually deliver.
- Are you always this aggressive after sex?
- You call this aggressive?
Oh, Yeah.
Hey, this is fun.
- Can we do it again next Friday ?
- You don't waste time, do you?
Life's too short.
I'm sorry I got so old
before I noticed.
- I'm never growing old.
- Hmm?
Time catches up.
What can you do?
Keep moving.
I had a really good time.
Yeah, me too.
- Well, good night.
- Bye.
How was your date?
Uh... Fine.
We had a good time.
Great. So did we.
I hate when she does that.
She's trying to break
the world record.
I can't look.
If she's not up in ten seconds,
call an ambulance.
I know you're planning
a celibate life,
but with half my chromosomes,
that might be tough.
Yuck, five seconds off.
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!
Okay, I'm coming! I've got
wonderful prizes for you!
- Toothpaste?
- Toothpaste!
- All right.
All right,
it's magic toothpaste.
- Mom--
- It's magic toothpaste.
Bye.
Hey, hey, wait, wait!
- Miss Kate, in the house.
Put your goldfish lips
in the house. Bye.
They're big.
I know, I know.
All right, team!
Swimmers' meet!
Quiet, please!
Swimmers, on the block.
Take your marks.
- A regular Esther Williams.
- What do I have?
Mrs. Flax?
Coach Parker.
So nice to meet you. Hi, Lou.
I don't have to tell you
how proud we are of Kate.
You know, I think she has Olympic potential.
- But I guess that doesn't surprise you.
- Not at all.
- Does she get it from you?
- Not at all.
- Nice job, dear.
- Thanks, coach.
- Hi, Mrs. Crain.
- Bye, coach.
Bye, dear.
Hey, I said painting
was my passion.
I didn't say I was good.
Girls, back me up here.
Did either of you ever once
hear me say to your mother
that I had talent?
- No.
- No.
- I rest my case.
Okay?
Now, will you stop being
a pain-in-the-ass critic
and pose for me?
Yes, but if you
make me look like that,
you're a dead man.
- Trust me.
- Right.
Girls, follow me.
Already
I feel inspired.
I'll show you where
you're sleeping.
Ladies?
- Okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Forgive me if
I don't linger, girls,
But when the muse calls,
the artist has to jump.
- Good night.
- Good night.
He's nutso.
I did Sophie from memory.
I've never worked
with a live one before.
Huh?
Now this is fun.
Don't you think
this is fun?
Cleo, baby...
That is not very regal.
- What's wrong with this picture?
- Compliments of Mrs. Landsky.
It seems she's frozen Lou's
meals for the next decade.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What a good morning.
- This is for you.
- Thank you.
- How did you sleep, Charlotte?
Did you weather the storm?
- Yeah. Fine, thanks.
This is how you normally
eat breakfast together?
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh.
- Oh, God.
Oh, dear God.
- What is it?
- What happened?
- The President's been shot!
- What?
The President's been shot!
Listen. Listen.
Governor Connally was shot
in the upper left chest.
I waved and the man--
the man--
It's all right, sir.
You waved at him.
and his wife reached up
toward him...
as he was slumping down
and the second shot went off
and it just knocked him down.
I'm sorry I can't help you more,
but I-I won't forget it.
The old man who did this job before me--
He had Indian ways.
He could stand so quiet,
his heels together,
like a little dancer.
The world's gone crazy.
I know.
I know.
I know.
In 1990, the Age of Space will
be entering its second phase,
as on earth,
The United States
is second to none.
Plutonium in day
dominate free bascum,
potassium, linoleum--
Wish I had trouble conceiving.
I can get pregnant if i hang
my clothes next to a man's suit.
No more fasting.
You're driving me crazy.
- Are you okay?
All right,
eat and get some rest,
and we'll just talk
about this tomorrow.
Oh, Lord, what have I done?
Sure.
Well?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
- Nothing.
Charlotte, what in the hell
is the matter with you?
What is happening in your brain
when you just sit there,
not moving, not speaking?
Joe doesn't know where she is.
We better get back.
So, she's angry,
blowing off steam--
that's okay.
But taking my car--
that's not okay.
That's going way too far.
Did she ever talk to you
about anything bothering her?
Lou, I'm her mother.
If something bothers her,
I'm the last person
she's gonna talk to.
She's a teenager.
I'm amazed she talks at all.
Where in the hell can she be?
I want to lead a violent
and exciting life!
Excuse me, sir.
I was out for a spin, and I seem
to be having engine trouble.
- Who is it?
- It's all right. It's just a young girl.
I'm a shepherd who has lost my flock.
Your folks know where you are?
Oh, yeah, they know exactly where I am.
Especially my dad.
He's that kind of guy.
I'll always
be here for you.
Okay, I won't always
be here for you.
Just sometimes,
if I feel like it or I happen
to be in the neighborhood.
- Is that better?
- I know she's doing this to turn my hair white.
She's doing this
because she has a problem,
and she's probably
too frightened to talk to you.
Why would she
be frightened?
Rachel, you can be
a little abrasive!
Shit, even I'm scared
to talk to you sometimes.
She's a kid! Lighten up!
Don't ride her too hard!
I don't need a lecture
on parenting from you!
Okay, that's it.
When she comes,
I'm leaving.
And you wonder why
she runs away from problems?
Will you listen to yourself?
- Are we having a fight?
- Yeah!
- Why?
- It relieves the tension!
Yeah?
Well--
The Discotheques,
which are nightclubs,
have been very well-known
and popular now for years
in Europe and South America.
- You like pancakes?
- Yeah.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
Do you like bacon?
Oh, yeah.
- How about sausage?
- Mmm.
- Toast?
- I love toast.
- What's your name?
Sal.
- Sal what, dear?
- Val. Sal Val.
My parents love rhymes.
We stay up late every night
trying to think of new ones.
Me, Mom, Dad, Sis
and my big brother Al.
Hello?
Yeah.
She's all right.
She's in New Haven.
When I was little,
we lived in Brazil...
and we owned
this big diamond mine.
My father would dance
with me all the time.
We would just dance
and dance and dance...
right in the middle
of the jungle.
Me and my sister--
she has these beautiful,
long red curls...
and she likes to wear
this jewelled crown thing.
Excuse me.
We would make
this pear wine.
- Charlotte?
- Bye. - Bye.
- Bye, Val.
Do you have
the slightest idea what
you've just put me through?
I thought you
were kidnapped.
I thought
you were dead.
I thought you were
laying by the road someplace,
chopped into a million pieces.
Go to your room!
I can't talk to you right now.
If I talk to you, I'll kill you.
Okay.
I've had a little scotch.
I'm real calm.
So, tell me, Charlotte...
What's going on?
- Are you trying to make me crazy?
Why were you running?
Running away doesn't
solve anything.
I'm a grown-up.
I don't run away.
I move on.
If something is bothering you,
tell me what it is.
Maybe I can help you.
How bad can it be?
Look, I'm really tired.
I just want to go to sleep,
okay?
Let me tell you something.
Sometimes being the mother
really stinks.
I don't always know
what I'm doing.
It's not like you
and your sister came
with a book of instructions.
If I can help you, tell me.
I'll give it my best shot,
but that's all I can do.
Where's Charlotte?
She's in her room,
somewhere in mars.
- What did she tell you?
- Nothing.
- Maybe her school counselor--
- Mrs. Crain? Are you kidding me?
That woman couldn't find her ass
with both hands.
Has she ever
done anything this
strange before?
She did get sent home
from school one time before...
for licking chalk
off a blackboard.
- God, her tongue was yellow for a week.
- What did she do that for?
She read in some book
that some saint had a vision
after licking a wall.
- Mm-hmm.
- The teacher sent home a note that said...
she thought charlotte
had psychological problems.
- What did you do?
- We moved.
Oh.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I heard you ran away.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You want to talk
about it?
It's kind of complicated.
Okay.
I was worried.
Joe, tell me
about your girlfriend.
My girlfriend?
There's nothing to tell.
Did you love her?
Yes, I did.
But her family moved away,
and I never got a chance
to see her again.
as if something
happened between us,
but it didn't.
Joe, do you like babies?
"Babies"?
Sure.
I love babies.
Someday I hope to have
a whole bunch of them.
Joan Ark?
- Hello. I'm Dr. Reynolds.
- How do you do?
- Actually, I just--
- First time here?
- Yeah, I just had a question.
- How's school?
It's great.
I wish we had it on weekends.
How old are you, Joan?
What?
Uh... 18.
Is everything okay?
Is there anything inside me?
Just get dressed
and come into my office.
Well, uh--
Joan, has your mother
ever talked to you about sex?
Yeah, all the time.
So you know how babies
are conceived?
Oh, yeah.
We talk about everything.
She's a wonderful mother.
Then why did you think
you were pregnant?
You're still a virgin.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How are you?
Can you do me a favor?
I need to go to Boston
on this jerk errand for my boss.
Could you
give the girls dinner?
Yes! I got a great
pot roast in the freezer
that Sophia left.
- Sound good?
- Anything that's hot...
and not shaped like a star
sounds good to me.
Very funny.
You know what?
Your mouth is starting
to sound like your sister's,
and I'm not pleased.
The Crain's are having
a party for New Year.
Did you get an invitation?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm going. Will you be there?
Lou, it's a goddamn
costume party.
- Go.
- A goldfish.
You're a big help.
Charlotte?
As always,
it was a pleasure.
Oklahoma
Where the wind comes
sweeping down the plains
And the waving wheat
can sure smell sweet
When the wind comes
right behind the rain
Oklahoma
Every night
my honey lamb and I
My young friend,
Esther Williams,
wanted to know what
it would feel like to sleep
at the bottom of the ocean.
Her wish being my command,
presto!
You're certifiable.
You know that,
don't you?
If that's true,
I'm hanging around
with the right family.
- Let's show her.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, that is so neat.
It's beautiful.
- Dinner!
- Dinner!
Let's eat. I'm so hungry.
Oklahoma
You did all of that
in one evening and
managed to cook dinner?
Charlotte
we have to thank
for the dinner.
A feast to put
Sophia to shame.
- Where did you learn how to do this?
- Home Economics.
If the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach,
I guess there's hope
for you yet, Charlotte.
Personally,
I've never found
that to be true.
- Mom.
- Yeah?
- Astroturf.
According to Lou, it's going
to ruin baseball, not to mention
the whole civilized world.
So if you ever want
to have a boyfriend,
start caring about it too.
- Mom?
- Yeah?
Why don't you marry Lou
so he can be our Dad?
- We already have one, Katie.
- Well, I've never seen him,
and he wouldn't make me an ocean.
- No.
- No!
- Actually, you're supposed to have two forks.
- Why do you need two?
You know what we did
if we used the wrong fork
or spoon when I was a kid?
- What?
- We had to go stick them
in the ground,
even if the ground
was frozen solid.
We used to call it
the hardware garden.
Can you believe that?
That's nothing.
A kid in school had
an uncle who died...
and got burnt up
and sprinkled
in a garden.
That's nothing.
St. Margaret of Antioch
lived as a shepherdess...
and she got eaten
by this dragon,
and it burst.
When I die, I want to be
sprinkled in the ocean.
I don't care
if a whale eats me.
- I can live inside a whale like Jonah.
- Girls--
- What if you end up in someone's tuna fish sandwich?
- Who are these people ?
Why did he take
his shirt off?
I think he didn't want
to spill his dinner on it.
- What's happening here?
What usually happens when
families sit down to a civilized
meal together. They talk.
Wait.
I never said
you could do this.
- Do what?
- Let Kate get so attached.
That's so terrible?
Yeah, this is not
your family.
If you want to get closer to me,
dial direct,
But don't do it
through my kids.
Never in my life have I wanted
to hit a woman the way I want
to hit you right now.
When you are wrong...
you are so wrong,
it's scary.
Your whole life, you never
did something for no reason
except to make somebody happy?
What is it you want from me?
A little trust
would be nice!
And if you care about us,
would it kill you to show it?
What do you mean, "us"?
Since when did you
and children become "us"?
You're just you, Lou.
Okay?
Me and the girls--
that's
I was talking
about you and me.
I'm almost ready.
Here's a little something.
- Ooh, an arm. - This year, Mom!
- Come on!
- Come on, Mom!
- One, two, three! Here I am!
- You're a Mermaid!
No, I'm a Lumberjack.
I'm a Car Salesman.
- Your beautiful tail!
- Thank you.
If I would have had this costume
when you guys were little,
I would have done my ironing
and all your diapers in it.
- Oh, my God! Wait a minute!
- Is this the Mermaid bus?
All right, I can tell
by my Mermaid watch...
It's time to get
into my Mermaid car
and hit the Mermaid road!
And get the Mermaid out of here.
You get my Mermaid coat...
And you get my Mermaid keys.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I was hoping I would be
fresh for the party.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Mom.
Have fun.
- Good-bye!  I will!
- Good-bye, Miss junior Mermaids!
- Hi, Mary. How are you?
- Hi, George.
- Thank you.
- Where's that handsome Hunk
of a husband of yours, huh?
Out front,
talking baseball.
He just bet 20 bucks
they couldn't name three players
that batted over .400.
Hey! Buzz!
I'll be right back.
Ty Cobb,
Joe Jackson, Nap Lajoie!
You owe me 20 bucks!
The last day ever
of this year.
You want to make
some resolutions?
What are resolutions?
They're sort of
like wishes.
I wish
I could swim forever.
I wish I had known
Anne Frank.
Oh, put that right here.
Boy, can we use that.
Why don't you stick around
and have a drink?
It's almost midnight.
Oh. Sorry.
- Hi, handsome.
- Hi, Carrie.
- Nice Caretaker's costume.
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi, Mrs. Flax. You look nice.
- Thanks.
- Mrs. Flax, I think it's time
you and I had a little dance.
- Okay.
Little Bo Peep.
- Honey, can you
help us with these?
- Yes.
- All right, now spin me.
- Yeah, okay.
- Watch my tail.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.
I'm on pins and needles.
Did you win the $20?
What do you think?
I'm planning a pilgrimage.
- Lourdes?
- No, Cooperstown.
- Ask me why.
- No.
- I'm gonna tell you anyway.
- Yeah, I thought you would.
Yeah.
The baseball hall of fame.
Before I bite the dust,
there's three things
that I want from life:
To touch Lou Gehrig's glove,
To be in Florida
for Spring Training...
and to take you with me
on both trips.
Two out of three,
that's not bad.
All right, ask me
in a couple of months.
- You mean if you're still here.
- Exactly.
Turn up the TV!
- What are we gonna do, Rachel?
- About what, Lou?
- This relationship.
- What's the matter with this relationship?
It's stuck.
It has to move or it has to end.
It can't just stay the same.
You know, Lou, ultimatums
don't sit really well with me.
- Thank you, Carrie.
- Lou?
- No, thank you.
What would you say
if I asked you to marry me?
First, I'd remind you
that you're still married,
and then I'd probably write...
from New Mexico.
Live with me.
No.
Seven, Six,
Three, Two, One!
Should old acquaintance
So far, 1964's a big drag.
Are you coming home with me?
Another night.
Happy New Year.
- Hey, Joe!
- Yeah?
I think
my car's dead.
You think so?
- Can you help me?
- Yeah, sure.
Good.
Thanks for the ride, Joe.
- Sure.
- You bet.
Oh.
Sorry.
Could you help me?
I have trouble
with this tail.
Happy New Year, Joe.
You kissed him?
How could you do that?
How could you
let her kiss you?
Charlotte,
it was just a little
New Year's Eve kiss.
- You don't believe in New Year's.
- I know.
Hey, what are you guys
fighting about?
- Nothing.
- Everything.
Get back in the house before
you freeze your little butt off.
What's the matter with Charlotte?
Is she gonna run away again?
God willing.
No, just kidding.
- Did you have a nice time?
- I had a lovely time, thank you.
Are you gonna stay out there
all night, Miss Poopy Face?
Why did you let her?
She kisses everybody.
Don't you know that?
It doesn't mean you're
special or anything.
It doesn't mean
she likes you
or anything like that.
She doesn't like anybody!
You give me Fever
Fever
Care to dance, Mrs. Flax?
Mrs. Polka Flax.
She's gonna kill you
if you put those on.
- Go back to your rocks, Kate.
- Okay.
Act your age,
not your shoe size.
Who's this?
"Know your colors,
know your fabrics.
Katie, shall I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.
- I'm in love with Joe Peretti.
- Do you kiss each other?
- Yes.
- On the lips?
- Yes.
- Like Superman and Lois Lane ?
Well--
What's it like?
Sometimes
when you kiss a person,
it's like nothing happens.
It's like you're kissing
your hand or you're kissing
yourself in the mirror,
But when
it's someone you love--
I know.
There's chemicals.
- You mean chemistry, Fish-Head.
- Oh.
- How do I look?
- Like someone drew all over you.
Let's Celebrate.
Cool.
Never know how much
something
What are you doing?
Sucking out the pimentos.
They give me hernias.
You mean, hives,
Fish-Head.
Hit me, sergeant.
Okay,
but you can only have one,
and you have to sip it.
Okay?
Fever
You're giving me
fever
Tell me about
when I was born.
- Aren't you sick of hearing this story?
- No.
Okay.
You were born
in a hospital
in Minneapolis...
on a cold
Winter's day.
And when Mrs. Flax
brought you home,
I pretended
you were mine.
Where was Pop?
I don't know.
Come on,
I'll show you
the convent.
Finish the story.
Come on.
I'll show you the tower.
You've never seen it.
Look, there it is.
Isn't it neat?
- Neat.
- I want to go up.
I'm gonna go up.
- Not me. I'll fall off.
- No, you won't.
- How you gonna get up there in those shoes?
- I'll manage.
- I'm gonna go collect rocks.
- Okay.
- I'll be right back, so don't go anywhere.
- Okay.
Okay, bye.
Get her inside.
Katie!
Look, Joseph,
get an ambulance.
Oh, Katie!
Katie! Oh, Katie!
Katie. Katie.
Katie, please don't die.
Please don't die.
Take Charlotte home
we'll call when
there's news.
Tell Lou.
Katydid--
You were born in a hospital
in Minneapolis...
on a cold Winter day.
I brought you home...
and Charlotte pretended
that you were hers.
She even tried to make you
call her Mom.
and we-- we--
We tickled your ears,
and we watched you sleep...
and... the only thing that--
The only thing
that we ever agreed on...
was that you were...
a wonderful child.
Charlotte?
Charlotte?
She's gonna be all right.
They're keeping her in
one more night for observation.
Your mother's on her way home
to pick up some clothes.
She's okay.
She's okay.
You look different.
You look beautiful.
- Take care.
- You too.
- Okay.
- Bye.
If you're smart,
you'll just stay away
from me.
I mean it.
You want to take the book?
What the hell were
you thinking about?
She could have died!
Your sister, who you were
supposed to be watching,
could have died!
What was she doing up there?
What the hell were you doing--
I know what you were
doing up there.
The whole goddamn town knows
what you were doing up there.
Mom. Mom--
I'm warning you,
I'm crazy angry!
Don't walk away from me, Mom!
You're not gonna
walk away from me!
I am not invisible!
Talk to me!
Yes, I made a mistake!
Yes, I am really,
really sorry!
It was a big mistake!
I know that!
You make mistakes!
You're always screwing up,
and we're always paying for it!
It is not fair!
God!
I am sick and tired
of being judged by you.
You're a kid!
When you become an adult,
you can live your life
any way you want to!
But until then, we're gonna
live my life my way!
Start packing.
No!
I said pack!
This move is on you!
If loverboy doesn't like it,
that's too goddamn bad!
This is not about him!
This is about me, okay?
That's over!
He is gone! He has left!
- Surprise, surprise!
- No, it's not like that!
Maybe your life works for you,
but it doesn't work for me,
and I want to stay!
- And do what?
- Finish High School!
Great start.
What's your major?
Town tramp?
No, Mom,
the town already has one.
You know...
You're just one year younger
than I was when I had you.
If you hate my life so much,
why are you doing your damnedest
to make the same mistakes?
How do you feel
about this guy?
I thought I loved him.
That sounds familiar.
And I thought you were
gonna take him away.
Did you love my father?
Yeah, I did.
What was he like?
Oh, he was charming and...
He made me feel really special
for about a minute and a half.
And then he was gone.
What did he look like?
He looked like you,
only taller.
I don't have any pictures.
We took pictures at the wedding,
and they didn't come out.
I guess I should have
known then.
He's never coming back,
is he?
No.
Has he ever even seen me?
Yeah, he did once.
You were about four.
He wanted us back?
No, he met some other woman,
and he wanted to get married.
How do you feel
about Joe leaving?
It's fine.
I guess it's a little too late
for our Birds-and-Bees Talk.
Mom...
Can we please stay?
I don't know.
There's gonna be so much talk.
This is such a small town.
There's always talk.
It's just usually
it's about you.
Sorry.
Just for a year.
Just give it a year.
Okay?
I don't know.
- Come here.
This--
this is Lou Gehrig's glove.
You see that?
Okay, you touched it.
All right, guys.
- Hey... Come on.
Would you do that
for your old man,
chew his shoes?
I don't think so.
Bye-bye.
Hey, give me a break.
I'm a nice old man.
I'd watch it
if I were you, Lou.
I might decide to move
to a real city.
I hate all these trees
and weather.
Ta-ta.
Yeah...
Trees and weather
can really get to a person.
Let me take these for you.
Hi.
Charlotte, we're not Greek.
I think I
heard Mom say she'd be
making a main course tonight.
- Nah.
- Nah.
I saw your wife !
And she was ugly!
