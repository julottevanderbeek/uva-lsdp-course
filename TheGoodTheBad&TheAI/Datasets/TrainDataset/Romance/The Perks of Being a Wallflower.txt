I am writing to you because
she said you listen and understand...
...and didn't try to sleep with
that person at that party...
Please don't try to
figure out who I am...
I just need to know that
people like you exist.
Like if you met me,
you wouldn't think I was...
...the weird kid who spent
time in the hospital.
You see, I haven't really talked to
anyone outside of my family all summer.
But tomorrow is my first
day of high school ever...
...I will visualize what it will be like on
the last day of my senior year.
Hop, freshman toads.
Hop! Let's move it, boys!
Worked out all summer.
Rock hard.
You know,
Why don't you guys get a room?
In the meantime, I'd hoped that my
sister Candace and her boyfriend Derek...
...would have let me eat
lunch with their Earth Club.
What are you doing
with that plastic spork?
Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.
Come on.
...I thought maybe my old friend Susan
would want to have lunch with me.
In middle school, Susan
was very fun to be around, but...
...now she doesn't like
to say hi to me anymore.
Before my brother went to
play football for Penn State...
But Brad's a senior and I'm me,
so, who am I kidding?
On the bright side,
one senior decided to...
...make fun of the teacher
instead of the freshmen.
He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
legendary goatee with a grease pencil.
..."you put down that prick
punch, you go kill some gooks."
That prick punch killed my best friend
in a Saigon whorehouse.
Are you proud to be a senior having to
take freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?
Either you call me Patrick
or you call me nothing.
He wasn't saying the impersonation
to be mean or anything.
He was just trying to make us
freshmen feel better.
Surviving your fascist shop teacher,
who needs to put kids down to feel big.
Oh, wow. This is useful guys.
We should read on.
My last class of the
day is advanced English...
...and I'm really excited to finally learn
with the smartest kids in the school.
Believe it or not she's gotten
straight A since kindergarten.
I'm going to be your
teacher for freshman English.
This semester, we're going to be learning
Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
Now, who'd like to get out
of the first pop quiz?
Alright.
Well, you can skip the quiz...
...if you tell me which author
invented the paperback book.
In fact, at the end of
the third chapter of his first novel...
...he had a man hanging
from a cliff by his fingernails.
- Yeah.
- Shakespeare.
That's a great guess, but no,
Shakespeare didn't write novels.
However, if you and I
had gone to a Shakespeare play...
We would have put those
pennies in a metal box...
I'll give you a free "A" on anything till
the final term paper if you get it right.
I used to get spaz.
I mean, come on, spaz?
You know, I heard
you had a tough time last year.
...one friend on your first day,
you're doing okay.
But if my English teacher is
the only friend I make today...
Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.
I'm okay.
...high school is even
worse than middle school.
If my parents ask me about it,
I probably won't tell them the truth...
...because I don't want them to
worry that I might get bad again.
If my Aunt Helen were still here,
I could talk to her.
And I know she would understand
how I am both happy and sad...
...and I'm still trying to
figure out how that could be.
Thank you, Derek.
It's Charlie's favorite.
He was a little nervous about
starting high school today...
You feel a little silly about
being nervous now, huh, champ?
- That's how you...
- "...make friends in the real world."
You know, you could be
a little nicer to Derek.
I'm sorry. The kid's a pussy.
I can't stand him.
- I really hope you love the mix tape I made.
- I do.
- The cover is hand-painted.
- Oh. Wow.
Hey, Babe.
This next one might be a little sad...
Did you already do the term paper
on To Kill a Mockingbird?
- Hey, Nothing.
- Hey, Nothing.
You wanna sit over here,
or are you waiting for your friends?
Thanks for not calling
me "Nothing" by the way.
And these assholes,
they actually think they're being original.
- So, uh... do you like football?
- Love it. Love football.
Question. Could the bathrooms here
be more disgusting?
He's still trying to shag that
waitress from the Olive Garden.
- Yeah.
- Who's this?
- Charlie... Kelmeckis.
- Kelmeckis! No shit!
- Your sister's dating Pony Tail Derek, isn't she?
- God!
It's nice to meet you, Charlie.
I'm Sam.
So, Sam, what's the plan?
Are we going to Mary Elizabeth's tonight?
Nope. She got caught watering down
her parent's brandy with iced tea.
Alright. We're going to Kings
after the game if you wanna come.
Are you kidding?
I love The Smiths!
The best breakup band ever.
What's your favorite song?
Asleep.
It's from Louder Than Bombs.
I heard it on Pony
Tail Derek's mix tape.
What about Eide's?
You love Eide's, right?
Yeah, of course.
They're great.
I think it sounds
so much better on the Vinyl.
You know, I used to be popular
before Sam got me some good music.
So, you should be careful.
She'll ruin your life forever.
- Hey, Nothing.
- Hey, Nothing.
Let it go! Jesus!
It's an antique joke!
So, what are you gonna do
when you get out of this place?
Well, My Aunt Helen said
I should be a writer, but..
- You could write about us.
- Yeah.
How long have you been
boyfriend and girlfriend?
He's not my boyfriend.
He's my step-brother.
My mom finally left my worthless dad and
married his nice dad when we moved here.
But She's not bitter or anything.
Make no mistake.
Charlie, I'm not a bulimic.
I'm a bulim-ist.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know what that is.
Oh, no problem.
Thank you guys for the ride.
God, would you turn that down?
You're gonna make us deaf.
So be it!
It's Rock and roll.
- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Charlie.
Your mom says Don't go
to Columbia with Candace.
- Don't go to Columbia...
- Shut...
Do you always want to
be a mama's boy, Derek?
- I am not a mama's boy.
- Yes, you are!
Because Every single time I go to
your house, every single time...
...and you stand there
like a little beach...
Charlie, Charlie, just go.
I can handle it.
Oh. Look at you guys,
dressed so nice.
You saw it.
He's never hit me before.
And I promise you he'll
never hit me again.
Oh, my God.
They're playing good music.
Holy shit. Holy shit.
They are! They're playing good music.
- Yes!
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse us! Excuse me!
- I'm sorry!
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
It's not like it's cute or original
you'd hope it'd be warm.
Yeah, of course.
Just remember, Charlie...
- Bob's not paranoid.
- "He's sensitive."
...that waitress from the Olive Garden,
she was such a tease.
- Only with Patrick's blessing.
- Patrick?
You're a hopeless stoner who
attends the culinary institute.
So, I'm gonna have to say
"no" on that, but nice try.
- Charlie?
- Oh, touché.
Are you ready to meet
some desperate women?
- Hi.
- Meet ladies.
- Mary Elizabeth.
- Alice.
So, I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt
blow jobs from both of you.
- Patrick, you're such a dick.
- Where the hell did you go?
The dance was a little boring,
don't you think?
You're so selfish.
We looked everywhere for you.
How is it that you've got meaner
since becoming a Buddhist.
No, you're doing
something wrong, I think.
- Or something very right.
- Yeah, well...
Oh, Charlie, you look like
you could use a brownie.
I was so hungry at the dance.
I was gonna go to King's...
Charlie. Charlie, what do you
think about high school?
People wear their letter jackets
even when it's 98 degrees out.
And why do they give out
letter jackets for marching band?
Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really
gonna regret that, you know...
...haircut when you
look back at old photographs.
I'm really sorry.
It sounded like a compliment in my head.
- God!
- Well, it's kind of true.
Come on, Sam.
He likes it. Just look at him.
The kind of pretty that deserves
to make a big deal about itself.
Okay, Charlie.
Let me make the milkshake.
It's like when you say your name
over and over again in the mirror...
So, I'm guessing
you've never been high before?
My best friend Michael.
His dad was a big drinker.
Kinda wished he'd left a note.
You know what I mean?
- It's up the stairs.
- Thanks, Sam.
- Who is that kid?
- Relax.
Yeah, I know you saw
something, but it's okay.
- Are you baked?
- "Like a cake."
And how you can't have 3 on a
match because then they'd find us.
And everyone laughed,
but I don't understand what's funny.
...that you're not gonna say
anything to anyone about me and Brad.
Okay?
This has to be our little secret.
Charlie just told me that
his best friend shot himself.
- What did I do?
- You didn't do anything.
Well, we didn't think there was
anyone cool left to meet.
- To Charlie.
- To Charlie.
- Oh, my God. What is this song!?
- Right? I have no idea.
Patrick, We've gotta
go through the tunnel!
- Sam, it's freezing.
- Patrick, it's the perfect song!
Patrick. Patrick, it's Sam.
It's Sam speaking to you...
- ...I'm begging you to...
- I concede!
Don't worry.
She does it all the time.
I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but
I've been trying hard not to be a loser.
...by listening to Sam's collection of big
rock ballads and thinking about love.
I am also writing essays and
studying extra books outside of class.
As it turns out,
Mr. Anderson is a writer.
He even had a play put up in New York once,
which I think is very impressive.
He and his wife might
go back there after this year.
I know this is selfish,
but I really hope he doesn't.
My favorite time, though, is lunch
because I get to see Sam and Patrick.
We spend the time working
on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine...
...about music and
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Mary Elizabeth is really interesting
because she is a Buddhist and a punk...
...but somehow she always acts like
my father at the end of a "long day."
Her best friend Alice loves vampires
and wants to go to film school.
I don't know why because
her family is rich...
Especially since I know that they
were all there for Patrick last year.
Patrick never likes to be serious,
so it took me awhile to get what happened.
When he was a junior, Patrick started
seeing Brad on the weekends in secret.
...because Brad had to get drunk
every time they fooled around.
Then, Monday in school,
Brad would say:
"Man, I was so wasted.
I don't remember a thing."
When they finally did it,
Brad said he loved Patrick.
No matter what Patrick did,
Brad kept saying his dad would kill him.
Patrick was eventually
able to help Brad get sober.
I asked Patrick if he felt sad
that he still had to keep it a secret...
...because at least now, Brad
doesn't have to get drunk to love him.
I think that I understand
because I really like Sam.
...and she said that
when Sam was a freshman...
...the upper classmen used to
get her drunk at parties.
I'd hate for her to judge me
based on what I used to be like.
So, I've been making her a mix tape
so she will know how I feel.
- C!
- C!
- Give a K!
- K!
- Gimme a Y!
- Y!
- What's that spell!?
- R-O-C-K-Y!
- I can't hear you!
- Rocky!
- One more time!
- Rocky!
That picture is gorgeous, Craig.
What did you use?
Color film, but black and
white paper for the printing.
Yeah. My professor gave me an "A,"
but for all the wrong reasons.
You'll see what I mean
when you get to college.
- I think I'll get into NYU.
- Yeah, I hope so.
Yeah, it's just if I'm going
to Penn State main campus...
I wish I would have
studied freshman year.
- Will you?
- Yeah, of course.
Just a mix tape.
No big deal.
I couldn't find that song
we were listening to...
...but, you know, I'm still
searching for it, so...
Yeah.
Way better than me as a freshman.
- I used to listen to the worst top 40.
- No.
And I thought someday I would be
at a party in college or something.
And I'd look up and see
this person across the room.
And from that moment, I'd know
everything was going to be okay.
- I hope it works out.
- I don't know.
Craig would be a big
step up from her last boyfriend.
I just hope she could stop
playing dumb with these guys.
I keep telling her...
don't make yourself small.
How about something
a little bit more upbeat, huh?
So, Sam tells me
you want to be a writer.
Poetry writes me.
You know?
- You want another one?
- Yeah.
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.
Why do nice people choose
the wrong people to date?
Can we make them know
that they deserve more?
- Hey.
- Hey! Hey, Sam.
I didn't see you come in.
How's it going?
You want to work on
probabilities and statistics?
20 dollars?
What do you need 10 dollars for?
This is my copy,
but I want you to have it.
If you fail me,
you get me next semester.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am below average!
- Below average!
- Below average!
- Guys.1210.
- What?
Wait, guys... a receipt!
She actually paid!
- Impossible!
- I'm so touched.
- Where's Craig?
- Oh, he went home to Connecticut.
- Who's your secret santa?
- I'll tell you, Sam.
I have received a harmonica,
a magnetic poetry set...
...and a mix tape
with the song "Asleep" on it...
...that I think I must
have given them to myself.
- Obviously.
- Beautifully done.
So, I'm guessing my secret
santa is Mary Elizabeth.
- Huh. Now, why do you say that?
- I don't know.
You know,
She bosses people around sometimes.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Sorry.
You'll be surprised to know that
your secret santa is actually... me.
Well, all the great writers
used to wear great suits.
So, your last present is on
a towel rack in the bathroom.
Wait a second.
There's only secret santa presents.
Mary Elizabeth, why are
you trying to eat Christmas?
Alright.
Mary Elizabeth, for you.
- Alice.
- Thanks.
- Come on out.
- Get out here, buddy.
- Come on! Charlie! Charlie!
- Charlie!
- Charlie! Charlie!
- Don't be shy.
What a display of man
I have ever seen!
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.
After all your help on my
Penn State application?
- I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.
I'm really sorry we
can't be here for your birthday.
I'm just sorry you have to
go back and visit your dad.
I'm in such a great mood,
I don't think even he could ruin it.
- You are.
- Well, what about you?
When I met you,
you were this scared freshman.
- I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.
- No.
Never see you coming.
And parents love you.
- Not even a 2nd grade valentine?
- No.
- Have I ever kissed a girl?
- No, no! Your first kiss...
He used to come over to
the house all the time.
You know Charlie, I used
to sleep with guys who...
But I want to forget
that for a minute. Okay?
I just wanna make sure that
the first person who kisses you...
...because your birthday
is on Christmas Eve...
...I figure you don't get
that many birthday presents.
I thought you should have my clock.
From the heart.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Come here, little sister.
- Hey, Chris.
- Come I got dinner ready.
- Oh, good.
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.
The luminaria is a landing
strip for Santa Claus.
Okay?
You're playing in a Bowl Game.
Well, you know, mom did say that
you have good friends now.
- ...you can just talk to them, yeah?
- Yeah.
And then, I'm going
to congratulate you...
...on being happy
because you deserve it.
- You said that an hour ago.
- Was that tonight?
Oh, I just saw this tree,
but it was a dragon...
...and then it was a tree again
and it just lied to me.
Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out.
Give me the...
...how crazy you really were,
no one would ever talk to you?
Then, how did you happen to be passed out
on the ground at 6 in the morning?
So, I went outside for a walk,
just to get some cold air.
I started seeing things.
So, I passed out.
More fun than you're
gonna have today, Sinatra.
Well what are we supposed to do?
We're going on in 10 minutes!
- They said in health class...
- Hello?
I know. They say that
about LSD just to scare you.
Craig has flaked out on us again.
So, I need a Rocky.
- Brad?
- No, No way.
No, I'm not...
There are people out here. No.
¶¶ Then if anything grows
while you pose ¶¶
¶¶ I'll oil you up and drop you down ¶¶
¶¶ Down, Down Down ¶¶
¶¶ And that's just one small
fraction of the main attraction ¶¶
Maybe I could join the cast as an
alternate or something?
...they're gonna need people
when we go to college.
- That'd be great. Thanks.
- Yeah.
Obviously, it is completely
stupid and sexist.
I mean it's like,
"Hey, thanks for the crumb."
And normally, I'd just blow it off
because school dances suck torture.
- Would you maybe wanna go with me?
- You wanna go with me?
Plus, you looked
really cute in your costume.
- You must be Mary Elizabeth.
- Yes.
- It's so nice to meet you.
- You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
- Please come in.
- Okay.
A little closer together.
That looks nice.
Buddhist, I need you to smile
a little bit more. There you go. Nice.
It's my first date,
I don't know what to compare it to.
Yeah. He said he didn't want to
go to some stupid high school dance.
I don't know.
If you like it, he should come.
Have a beautiful first date.
You deserve it.
Yeah. My dad collects wine,
but he doesn't drink.
Their club is hosting
a cotillion or something racist.
...I wanna move to a house
like this in Cape Cod.
- Sounds nice, doesn't it?
- Yeah.
- Charlie?
- Uh-huh.
- Do you like me?
- Uh-huh.
...I didn't know how tonight
was gonna go tonight, but...
- ...it was really nice, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
Shit!
My parents! Shit!
- Here, zip this up!
- Okay. No, no, I got this. Yeah.
- Just zip it up, like a normal zipper!
- Stuck. It's just...
I'm sorry I haven't
written for awhile, but...
We're literally making out,
and I'm in my bra.
Hello! And the front door
opens. It's my parents!
I probably should have been
honest about how I didn't...
...want to go out with Mary
Elizabeth after Sadie's, but...
...I really didn't want
to hurt her feelings.
You see, Mary Elizabeth
is a really nice person...
...underneath the part of
her that hates everyone.
And since I heard that having
a girlfriend makes you happy...
...I tried hard to love her
like I love Sam.
Can you believe it's almost
our two week anniversary?
- Do you want butter in your popcorn?
- Vegans don't eat butter.
And I tried not to mind that
she loves to hold hands...
And I had to admit something
really upsetting. But...
I thought maybe if she
would just let me pick...
...the make-out music once in awhile,
we might have a chance.
And maybe if she didn't put down the
books that Mr. Anderson gives me.
Walden?
I read this in 7th grade.
I would have called it
"On Boring Pond."
Or if she would stop calling me
the minute I get home from school...
...when I have absolutely nothing to talk
about other than the bus ride home.
That dairy just sits with you.
You know, it walks with you.
For Christ's sake...
I need to use the phone!
I'll give you this book.
It's really how I became a vegan...
...but I was getting so mad,
it was starting to scare me.
I just wish I could have found
another way to break up.
- Um... Mary Elizabeth. Can I talk to you...
- Charlie. Please, don't interrupt.
In hindsight, I probably
could not have picked...
...a worse way to be honest
with Mary Elizabeth.
- Truth or dare?
- Who are you talking to?
Samantha told me that
you got into Harvard.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- You're just wait-listed.
- Yeah.
You guys are about to miss
some severely hot "fag on goth" action.
- Get a room!
- You're a monster!
- Truth.
- How's your first relationship going?
...that I keep fantasizing that
one of us is dying of cancer...
...so that I don't have to
break up with her.
Truth or dare?
Hello?
- Dare.
- Okay.
I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl
in the room on the lips.
And notice I charitably
said girl and not person...
...because let's face it,
I'd smoke all you bitches.
I really didn't mean
anything by it. I'm sorry.
No, Charlie, Trust me.
You don't want to go back there.
...but there's history with
Mary Elizabeth and Sam.
Things that have nothing
to do with you.
Dear friend, I have not seen
my friends for 2 weeks now.
Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on
earth as it is in Heaven.
And forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us...
I've been listening to the
Billie Holiday CD like every night...
Look, I know. I just feel really
bad about what I did.
I just get so messed up inside
like I'm not there or something.
I know. I'm sorry. I just...
We've all become such good friends...
Do you mean the people that
I've known since kindergarten...
...and you've known for 6 months?
Those good friends?
Yeah. I mean I just don't want to
do anything to ruin our relat...
It's ruined. Okay?
So, stop calling everyone.
- Some kids jumped him outside the O.
- It was some kids from North Hills.
- What happened?
- It's not what I heard.
- Are you okay?
- Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry.
- You gonna do anything?
- What are you talking about?
I'm talking about your
pet ape just tripped me.
- Why would I?
- You know why.
This is pathetic, man.
Your fixation on me.
Do you want your friends to know
how you got those bruises? Really?
- I got jumped in a parking lot.
- Where? Schenley Park?
I don't know what kind of
sick shit you're trying to pull.
- What did you just call me?
- I called you a faggo...
Say that shit again!
Say that shit again!
Touch my friends again
and I'll blind you.
- Charlie?
- Yeah?
I keep trying, but I can't
really remember what I did.
- So, you're not gonna scare of me?
- No.
He's opinionated, and we
have intellectual debates.
You were very sweet, but our
relationship was too one-sided.
Yeah, I'll go put
some pep in her step.
I'll tell you something, Charlie.
I feel good.
And maybe tomorrow I'll take you
to this karaoke place downtown.
And this club off the strip.
They don't card.
You have to see the
"fruit loop" at least one time.
My life is officially
an after school special.
So, you ever hear the
one about Lily Miller?
- I don't know.
- Really?
I thought your brother would
have told you. It's a classic.
- Maybe.
- Okay.
Lily comes here one night
with this guy Parker.
And this was to be the night that
they were gonna lose their virginity.
So, she did it really proper.
She packed a picnic.
Everything was perfect,
and they're just about to 'do it'...
...when they realize they
forgot the condoms.
- So, what do you think happened?
- I don't know.
- Oh, that's disgusting!
- Yes! It is!
Come on.
Let's keep the train rolling.
There was this girl named
Second Base Stace.
And... well, She had boobs
in the like 4th grade...
And she let some
of the guys feel them.
- Did you at least cop a feel?
- Yeah.
- No.
- No, of course not.
You went home,
listened to "Asleep", wrote a poem...
There was this one guy.
Queer as a 3 dollar bill.
The guy's father
doesn't know about his son.
So, he comes
into the basement one night...
But not like the slap kind.
Like the real kind.
And the boyfriend says,
"Stop. You're killing him."
I could meet the
love of my life any second.
Things will be different now,
and that's good.
I've been spending
a lot of time with Patrick.
He always says he feels free,
and tonight is his destiny.
But after awhile, he runs out
of things to keep himself numb.
"We will require you to take our
summer session at the main campus...
...immediately following your
high school graduation."
After that all Patrick could talk about
was college and all their futures.
Patrick is going to the
University of Washington...
...because he wants to be
near the music in Seattle.
But he wasn't going to leave without
organizing the best senior prank ever.
Sam is going to leave
right after graduation.
Especially because ever since
I blacked out in the cafeteria...
Guys, you want to pass your copies
of Gatsby up to the front please?
...but if we could just
keep it to a dull roar...
Guys, guys,
Thank you for such a great year.
I had a blast.
I hope you did, too.
And I hope you have a great time
this summer on your vacations.
Now, who here is gonna read
for pleasure this summer?
So, I know it's none of my business,
but have you decided?
And I think I might be better
at teaching than writing.
You know, Charlie.
I was thinking that...
...Maybe I could still give
you books next year.
I think you could write
one of them one day.
- Let's get the hell out of here!
- One!
And just a few hours
before, everyone I love...
...had their last day
of high school ever.
And I was happy
because they were happy...
...even though I counted,
and I have...
I kept imagining what school
would be like without them...
...as they they were all
getting ready for their prom.
My sister finally decided
to break up with Derek...
...and go stag with her
girlfriends instead.
I've looked at her
pictures since that night.
I like to see how happy
she was before she knew.
They were in a hotel suite after prom
when the truth came out...
Basically, Craig has been
cheating on Sam the whole time.
When I heard that, I kept thinking
about the happy girl in these pictures.
Because she doesn't
have 1,095 days to go.
And no one should be
able to take that away.
- Congratulations.
- Oh, Charlie! Charlie's here!
Oh, get against the railing
and try to look suave!
Yeah, this is the one.
That's gonna be a great angle.
...I wanted her to know about that night
we went through the tunnel.
And how for the first time,
I felt like I belonged somewhere.
- Thanks for staying up with me.
- Sure.
My brother said Penn State has this
restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.
You have to get a grilled
stickie on your first night.
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah.
Pretty soon, you'll have a whole
new group of friends, you know.
You won't even think
about this place anymore.
I'm driving away,
and I'm just feeling so small.
Just asking myself
why do I and everyone I love...
...pick people who
treat us like we're nothing?
...you can't just sit there and
put everybody's lives ahead of yours...
...that were in my head
most of the time, you'd know...
And how we've been
through the same things.
- What's wrong, Charlie?
- Oh, nothing.
- We'll all see each other in New York.
- All the time.
- Put your seat belt on.
- We'll meet you there.
Look, Charlie.
She's fast asleep.
My fault.
My fault.
My fault.
It was all my fault.
- Hey, Candace.
- Charlie?
...I just can't stop
thinking about something.
She died getting my birthday present,
so I guess I killed her, right?
I've tried to stop
thinking that, but I can't.
- ...and dying over and over.
- Call the police and send them to my house.
- And I can't stop her. I'm crazy again.
- No, Charlie, listen to me.
Mom and dad are going to be
home with Chris any second.
I was just thinking...
what if I wanted her to die, Candace?
You have to let me go.
My dad can't afford it.
- Don't worry about that.
- No.
And I don't know
how to not notice it.
No! Not me.
It's them. It's everyone.
You said some things
about her in your sleep.
Charlie, are you gonna
let me help you here?
Do you remember anything
before you blacked out?
But I will say there were
some very bad days.
...my doctor told my mom and
dad what Aunt Helen did to me.
The best days were those
when I could have visitors.
My brother and sister
always came for those...
...until Chris had to
go to training camp.
And my sister told me
she met a nice guy at her summer job.
My doctor said we can't
choose where we can come from...
...but we can choose
where we go from there.
...but it was enough to start
putting these pieces together.
God bless food
we are about to receive.
We thank You for this bounty in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
- Amen.
- Amen.
So, how do you think the Penguins
are gonna do this year, dad?
I think they're allergic
to God damn defense.
Are you sure it's not
a "God damn biscuit?"
Honey, I think we're gonna have
to do a little shopping for you...
You have to visit in the Fall.
We'll have some. Okay?
Oh, sorry. Charlie has
a breakdown scheduled for October.
It's another world.
And it gets better.
And my roommate Katie
has the best taste in music.
I don't know if I will have the
time to write any more letters...
...because I might be too
busy trying to participate.
So, if this does end up
being the last letter...
...I just want you to know that I was in a
bad place before I started high school.
Even if you didn't know
what I was talking about.
Because I know there are people who
say all of these things don't happen.
And there are people who forget what
it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.
I know these will all
be stories someday.
And our pictures will
become old photographs.
And we'll all become
somebody's mom or dad.
But right now,
these moments are not stories.
This is happening.
I am here.
This one moment when you
know you're not a sad story.
And you stand up and see
the lights on buildings...
And you are listening to
that song on that drive...
...with the people
you love most in this world.
