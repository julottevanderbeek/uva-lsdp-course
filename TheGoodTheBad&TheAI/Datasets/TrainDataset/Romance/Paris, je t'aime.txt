A collective film
Paris, I Love You
Little neighborhood romances...
But in the end they still get married.
I meant every word I said
in the Louvre this morning.
Bicycling? Where does
he bicycle to?
You're leaving?
Shit.
All grabbed!
Shitty neighborhood,
shitty radio...
Give me a break, slug ass!
Move, you bitch!
Already?
Crazy.
Shove off, buttface.
I just got here so I'm, like...
Brats, fucking brats...
All grabbed. It's getting tragic.
What's wrong with me?
I'm well preserved, adaptable,
I have a nice car
in running order...
OK, minus a wiper blade
and one air bag, but still...
A salary not to be spat at,
a decent sense of humor...
I can laugh at lots of things,
including myself.
I'm laughable. A lonely joke.
My world is a glove box. Empty.
What the...
Can you hear me?
Stand back! I'm a doctor.
Keep your wife
lying down.
Lie still.
Down, girl, down!
Nothing to worry about.
Down, girl!
Let her sit up.
Should we dial 911?
No need.
It's just low blood sugar.
Eat carrots.
Better still, beets.
For sugar.
You'll feel better lying in my car.
Good idea.
Down, girl, down!
Drop the "Down, girl".
It's annoying.
Suit yourself.
Is she OK?
I'm afraid I have nothing for you.
I'm not big on Kleenex boxes
in the back window.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
You stayed calm.
I took a first aid course.
If you'd hadn't come to,
I'd have given you CPR.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
I'd have laid you
out straight...
Can you turn off the music?
I liked the feel
of your hand on my neck.
Me too.
When you think about dolphins
stranded on a beach,
people throw seawater over them,
but it's useless.
They die surrounded
by unknown beings.
Who says it's useless?
Anyhow,
your shoes are great.
My CLarks?
I've had them since I was 14.
I don't wear them every day.
I treasure them.
No. No, no, no.
My tobaccologist is expecting me.
My tobaccologist.
Soon?
I'll drive you.
The traffic may be bad.
No problem. I'll weave around.
I won't be long.
No problem. I'll wait... for you.
Check that thong!
Honey's got an ass
like a peach.
Show me your thong,
I need to floss my teeth.
Please!
Oh!
Check out the Thai hottie.
How about a hot Thai massage?
I have a place nearby.
Woo-hoo.
She didn't have
any tits anyway.
I get more pussy
than you two put together.
In your dreams man.
Why do I always
have to get the girls?
You ain't got shit so far.
Leave it to a true player.
Hey, ladies!
You're looking sweet today.
Yeah? Call me when
you're old enough to shave.
She dissed you, man.
You ain't never getting laid.
You're the one not getting laid,
not me.
You're in France now!
Asshole.
Nice trip!
That's not cool.
Where you going?
You OK, Miss?
Virgin to the rescue!
You OK?
Assholes.
Thanks.
They're just ignorant.
I'm sorry.
Doesn't matter.
Can I help?
Please.
Sorry!
I don't know how...
How's that?
How do I look?
I'll show you.
Give us a smile.
You're even worse at this
than getting girls.
My friends do that stuff,
not me.
They're pathetic.
You have beautiful hair,
why do you have to cover it up?
I don't have to. I choose to.
Too bad, 'cause you're so pretty.
You mean I'm not beautiful
in my hijab?
That's not what I meant.
You and your friends
don't know shit about women.
Why talk to them like that?
When you can see they don't like it?
If I want to look beautiful,
I do it for me.
When I wear this
I feel part of a faith, an identity.
I feel good.
That's what beauty is.
T ell that to your friends.
Then maybe one day,
they might even get laid.
I have to go.
Where to?
The mosque.
Can you...
Thanks.
And thanks
for helping me.
No problem.
You got a crush?
What?
You into brown girls now?
Fool, you touch her and Osama
will personally bomb your ass.
That's true, man.
Hey, girls!
Looking for me?
Babe, you're late!
I've been here an hour!
Hi.
Grandpa,
the boy who helped me.
I'm surprised
to see you here.
François.
I'm Zarka.
How are your hands?
OK.
It was good of you
to help her.
Only natural.
Are you going our way?
Are you a student?
Yes. History.
Good boy.
Knowing your history
is very important.
My Zarka wants to be
a journalist for Le Monde.
She wants to write
about France,
but her France.
God willing.
God willing.
Hello!
Elie?
Can you get us
some wine?
So...
Let's take a look.
Fantastic.
Have you got something
that you can--? You can
get this color somehow?
These colors are--
She says it's important
to get the same red.
Right.
Is this--? Is this--?
It's-- It's almost
a blood red,
but I don't know if it is a blood.
It depends on what kind of blood.
Blood red.
Did--? Did we use
blood, Gaspard?
No, I think we used auto paint.
I think it was car paint.
Come out back, we'll find it.
Haven't we met?
I'm sure I know you.
Where do you live?
I'm in the 17th.
Maybe I've seen
you around.
You don't talk much!
I'm not sure, but...
I feel I've seen you before.
You look like a mystical guy.
Really, you have
a very special aura.
You believe in spirits?
I'm way into that stuff.
Maybe we met in a past lifetime.
Light?
A light.
Thanks.
It's amazing. As soon as
I saw you, I needed to talk.
It's like...
I don't know.
A strong, weird feeling.
I thought,
if I don't talk to you before I go,
I'd be missing out on...
something...
important.
Beautiful.
You work in a beautiful place.
I didn't want to miss the chance
to talk to you. It's dumb, but...
Never mind. May l?
You believe in soul mates?
Finding your other half?
You like jazz?
Charlie Parker...
And Kurt Cobain. I love him!
Whatever.
Here's my number.
I'd really like to talk with you...
if you call me...
more seriously and...
for longer, especially.
All done.
Have a good trip back.
Goodbye.
What's up?
I'm not sure, Christian. He gave me this.
A phone number?
I don't know what he was saying.
I don't speak French that well.
He used a lot of phrases
that aren't in my phrase book.
Call him and see.
What are you looking at,
asshole?
What are you looking at,
asshole?
Stop!
What are you looking at, asshole?
Stop.
I'm talking to you.
What are you looking at, asshole?
What are you looking at, asshole?
I'm talking to you, faggot!
Is it my girl you like?
You want to fuck her?
Look at that faggot!
Is it my girl you like?
You want to fuck her?
Look at that faggot!
Leave us the fuck alone!
Fuck off!
Fuck off!
Don't make fun of me!
Do you think that's funny?
This asshole's trying to make
fun of me! Little piece of shit!
What are you trying to do,
you little piece of shit!
Something wrong?
Stop!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm doing what I want, you jerk!
Bring your ass back over here!
Oh, shit! You whore!
And with tongue!
Shit! Can't be!
Not that bad.
You're a real killer.
You must work out.
So...
Do you like hot jazz?
What'd you do with your tongue?
OK - you done now?
OK - now I'm done.
Feel better?
Yeah.
You're crazy.
Must be if I'm with you.
Do you love me.
Forever.
See how I fixed him?
I loved it.
Don't stare at people,
it's rude.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh.

Excuse me, madam...
Testing, 1-2-3.
Do you know this...
...this hair salon?
Hey, skaters.
Hi, guys.
Do you know this place?
Madame Li?
Good luck.
Really?
Sit!
Take a number!
Why you here?
Nice to meet you.
My name is Mr. Henny.
Henny or "ai ni"?
I'm a rep for Luneol.
I'm here to present our
latest line of special products
for Asian hair problems.
Dammit!
What Asian problems?
I'll come back whenever...
We have no problems!
The problem
is you!
Jean?
Bobby. How's your first day going?
It's going OK, boss.
You're in for a big bonus.
No phones!
Find me Henny!
He's right here, ma'am.
Madam wants to see you.
Just like movie stars!
Beautiful!
What if Henny doesn't come back?
You're here!
Henny, ai ni.
Get to work!
But... I've never done this before.
It's a cinch.
Let's go.
What class!
Spray!
You're here!
Ai ni.
It means
"I love you."
I love you.
Wouldn't you prefer me like this?
No, I like you better like this.
That's how I like you.
He watched his wife
cross the street,
in the red trench coat
she always swore she'd throw out,
but always retrieved
from her closet, year after year.
She was like that about
everything. It was the trait
that attracted him
when they first met.
The clothes she wore
again and again,
the stacks of untouched lipsticks,
the song...
that she sang
while cooking dumplings,
belonged to a life
that felt alien now,
a life he was planning to quit
between the entrée and dessert.
It struck him
how oddly logical it was
to choose this place to leave her.
This very place,
where he first realized
that he no longer loved her.
When she smiled, he nearly shouted
"I'm leaving you so don't smile!"
But he merely gave her
a sip of his "kir".
Another thing that irked him
was that she never ordered
an appetizer or dessert
but always ate most of his.
Worse still, he always
ordered foods she liked.
"Do I even like profiteroles?"
he pondered.
When she started weeping
like he'd never seen before,
at first he thought
she knew he was leaving her
for Marie-Christine,
the hot-blooded air hostess
he'd loved for the past 18 months.
"This is it, " he thought.
"She knows. "
"She's known for ages.
I should have guessed. "
Still weeping,
she brought out some papers
and gave them to him.
In coldly clinical terms,
they said
she had terminal leukemia.
Sorry.
In a flash, his first purpose
flew from his mind
and a strange, metallic voice
began telling him,
You have to rise to this occasion!
And he did.
He ordered three servings
of profiteroles to go
and text-messaged his mistress.
FORGET ME.
SERGIO
He tended to his wife
in every way she'd ever wanted,
hanging pictures around the house,
taking her to see
her favorite movies in the daytime,
bargain-hunting with her
although he hated shopping,
reading Sputnik Sweetheart
out loud to her.
Every little thing
had a different flavor,
knowing he'd never be able
to do it for her again.
By acting like a man in love,
he became a man in love again.
When she died in his arms,
he fell into an emotional coma
and never recovered.
Even now, many years later,
his heart always lurches at the sight
of a woman in a red trench coat.
Mommy.
Cowboys still exist. They do.
I've seen them in books.
You said they're all gone
but it's not true.
Mommy.
Mommy, mommy.
Cowboys do still exist.
It's true.
I've seen them in books.
You said they're all gone
but it's not true.
Isis,
go to the kitchen.
You want to grieve to death?
It's been a week now.
He's gone to heaven.
If God makes me
suffer this much,
there's no goodness on earth.
Can I go out
and play with my friends?
I'm going out, Mom!
Justin?
Don't go!
Justin, score a goal!
Justin?
Justin?
Justin?
Oh, Justin.
Justin.
You wanna see your little boy?
Do you really have the courage
to follow me?
Mommy!
There's a cowboy!
Can I go see him?
Please!
Don't go!
Please, please!
Don't go! You mustn't!
Suzanne!
Listen!
Daddy's calling you.
Mommy! Mommy!
Isis and Daddy are waiting for you.
Can I go now?
Suzanne!
What happened?
Where did you get this strength?
From God.
What's your name?
Don't look at your parents.
Look at the camera.
What's your name?
Jean-Claude.
How did your parents meet?
In the prison.
In prison? Tell me about it.
Papa was sad because he had no wife
and he woke up alone
in his house every day.
MIME ASS
Come back here, smart ass!
Let me out!
Shut your trap!
Get me away from these two!
Gimme a break!
I want another slammer!
I want another cell!
Let me out!
I'll never touch another drop!
Help! Let me out!
They're like animals!
And that's my story.
Son of a mime!
Claire!
I'm sorry. I came as soon as I could.
I said take the subway.
I didn't expect you to call.
Maybe I shouldn't have.
What are you talking about?
We've already
come this far.
I don't know.
Wait a minute.
Don't you trust me?
Can't you speak French,
the one time you're in Paris?
Ah, come on, Claire.
You know sooner or later
this has to happen.
Why not while
I'm still young, huh?
You're not young.
No.
But I'm experienced.
"Experienced".
But I'm experienced.
If Gaspard wakes up
and realizes I'm not there,
he's going to be
very pissed off.
You'll be back before he notices. Huh?
And what if I'm not?
Is this the way
you intend to live your life?
A slave to Gaspard?
You have no idea
what he's capable of.
Where's your sense
of adventure, huh?
You think that's funny?
This is my life, fuck.
It's my life too.
But I-- I was touched you called,
you know.
I was desperate.
And you...
thought of me.
For crying out loud!
You ask me to trust you?
Look what you do!
Huh?
You're smoking?
I am.
You'll stink of butts.
Buts?
Your breath.
Claire, wait, wait, wait. Claire.
I'm sorry pour tout.
I'm sorry.
Here, sweetie.
I apologize.
"Apologize".
All right.
I'm sorry about being late,
I'm sorry about the cigarette.
It'll be fine, it-- it'll be--
I promise. You'll see.
You'll see.
When, after today,
after I've shown to you,
I'll be the one
who has to go hiding.
Please, please,
please trust me. Trust me.
I'm scared.
Sometimes I feel that Gaspard
is taking over my life.
Well, you know,
you have to start--
You have to let go
a little.
Maybe that way,
you know, we can see
each other more often, no?
I've been dreaming so long
for this day
and when I finally go for it,
I feel guilty.
Ah, guilt.
Don't, don't, don't.
Let's at least give it
a chance, huh?
Claire, make Gaspard
a balloon,
not a ball and chain.
Was I a ball and chain?
My little Claire.
You were not a ball and chain.
You were a zeppelin.
Thanks, Daddy.
Now you should go have fun,
you know.
When was the last time
you went to the movies?
Oh...
Huh?
Pfft!
Ah.
Ah, Sarah.
Hello, Mr. Lang.
Good to see you, Sarah. Ah!
My little Gaspard!
Shh! Don't wake him up. I told you,
if he gets started, he won't stop.
Okay, all right,
all right. Okay.
Go on. Sarah,
take your friend and--
Okay. Come on.
It's getting late, go on.
Bye-bye, my dears.
Excuse me. For the baby.
Oh.
It's very nice.
Okay.
Okay, thank you, Sarah.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye. Bye.
My little Gaspard.
Shit.
Ken for Liz.
I'll get Liz.
Ken, I don't have any cash.
We'll get some.
You know where there's an ATM?
First street on the right.
Got nothing smaller?
No.
Let's break it there.
OK.
'Evening.
What do you want?
A beer.
Two beers, please.
What brings you to Paris?
A role in a movie.
What kind of movie?
A costume drama.
You shooting tonight?
Yes.
All night long.
I have to go there
in an hour.
Can I come watch?
If you want.
I won't get thrown out?
What?
Will I get thrown out?
You can...
call me.
What's your number?
Dial 001 first.
It's an American phone.
Careful, it's strong.
See you later.
Whoop!
You should turn off your phone.
Oh, it's my agent.
They're shooting.
No, I'm waiting for a call.
I haven't forgotten you.
Yes?
Are they ready?
No, you still have a lot more times.
We still have a lot more times.
This is Liz.
If you want to come,
it's now or never.
Do you need me?
Yes. Yes.
The same thing, for a friend.
My-- My trailer...
Is the second one on rue Payenne.
Where's Ken?
He's on a delivery.
A major customer.
He asked me to help you out.
OK.
See you.
Careful, it's strong.
Well, you know.
I guess I got stung
by a lousy mosquito.
These neighborhoods are risky.
Lagos is safer.
What's your name?
Sophie.
I'd give you my card
but I have none left.
Too bad!
Sophie...
Fancy a cup of coffee?
Go on!
Can I massage your feet?
Why would I let you?
Because they hurt.
They do?
You were running
in my dreams all night.
Please have a coffee with me.
They're coming.
Could you get us
two coffees please?
What's the idea?
Are you nuts?
Don't you remember me?
Miss! Wrong way!
That's it.
Thanks.
Anytime.
Pretty song.
Thanks.
Fancy a cup of coffee?
Don't give me this shit.
Get working! You need
a kick in the ass?
Pack up and get out.
You're fired.
Sorry. My mistake.
Mistake? You know him?
What are you doing here?
You don't know him either?
Let me see your guitar.
Just for a second.
I'll give it back.
Relax! I'll give it back.
 Now I'll go far
with your guitar! 
What the...?
Easy! He's kidding.
Where you think you are?
Excuse me.
You're new?
Your coffees, Miss.
What can I get you, sir?
Bourbon.
Play my song again, please.
Yes, of course.
CAN TELL ME GOODBYE"
Lovely song.
I fell in love to this song
for the first and...
only time in my life.
How lovely.
What would you like?
It depends on the price.
Is there some sort of menu?
Get out of here!
Be quiet.
I felt something back there,
between us.
This girl, she'll be
meaningless to you.
I can offer something she can't.
Um...
What do you charge
to watch?
Two hundred.
I'm worth it. I...
We, uh...
This is where you kiss me.
I know that. It's the line.
So obvious, "I'm worth it."
A woman would never say that
to a man, it's ridiculous.
You're playing yourself.
But I won't say it. I won't.
Why do you need it?
I don't. I just thought
it would be a nice change.
Uh-huh.
Nice change?
Affection would be
a nice change.
A look without
resentment.
Kiss me on impulse!
Surprise me!
Me, me, me, me. You always want
your feelings understood.
But mine are childish.
Sex isn't disgusting
unless you make it disgusting.
There can be beauty
in this place too.
Not what I call beauty.
I need a little help.
You don't know what it's like
for a man when it's all gone.
I can't feel anything anymore.
Do you feel that?
What do you charge
to watch an argument?
Can't we walk together?
I'm so ashamed.
Why? You did it
out of love, I assume.
And what do you do,
out of love?
I ache...
for who we were.
Surprise.
We don't have
a million years.
Nobody does, my love.
You're the only woman
I've ever loved.
Who are you?
Take your dirty paws off me!
Stop giving me that crazy stare.
You say you ache
for who we were.
I, for one,
have never been better.
CLOSING SOON
Late at night...
It's so beautiful.
It's a bunch of graves.
There are loads
of amazing people here.
There's Chopin,
Sarah Bernhardt, Proust.
Dead people.
You're angry we're here?
There's just so much
that we have to do.
We are on holiday.
Honeymoon.
We are supposed to be having lunch
right now. It's a five-star restaurant.
We're not married for another
month. It's over here, I think.
We-- We agreed that this
would be our honeymoon.
It's the only gap we got
in our schedule for six months.
Your schedule. Because
you took that consulting job.
You said I could.
If you're going to marry me,
you've got to know when I'm lying.
That's just basic stuff.
You lied to me?
Not in a bad sense.
Oh, it's just good lies for me,
then, is it?
Only the best.
Do you love me?
Of course I do.
How do I know
you're telling me the truth?
Why don't you make that
your assignment for today?
I believe you.
Now, just learn to make me laugh
once in a while, and we'll be all right.
But I'm not funny, I'm never funny.
You told me so yourself this morning
at the Louvre. You said--
What's said in an art museum
should never be taken seriously.
I take everything seriously,
it's a serious world.
I don't think I've ever made
anyone laugh, ever.
There's always a first time.
Now, it should be right around...
There.
Ah, it's...
ugly.
That's not funny.
Oscar Wilde.
Why did you wanna see
his grave in particular?
Because he makes me laugh.
Oh, that humor thing again.
You know what his dying words were?
"Bury me under something ugly"?
He's lying on his deathbed
in this cheap Left Bank hotel.
He can't stand the way the room
is decorated, but he can't afford to move,
so seconds before he dies he turns
to his friends and he says:
"Either this wallpaper goes or I do."
Oh!
What are those?
Appreciation.
I can't believe you did that.
Who knows where those lips
have been?
I can't marry you.
I didn't mean your lips.
No, I can't.
A life without laughter?
You're not gonna marry me
because I don't make you laugh?
What do you want from
a husband? Pratfalls?
No.
Lightness.
Well, I'll start taking levity lessons
the moment we get married.
Don't hold your breath.
Wait, you're threatening me
with abandonment?
I meant every word I said
in the Louvre this morning.
Oh, for God-- I knew it.
You're a pot of gloom,
I deserve a wit, a poet!
Oh, fine, go find yourself a nice little garret
on the Left Bank, be witty and starve.
You know what?
I'm better off without you--
Ow! Ow!
It's fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm-- I'm fine.
As a matter of fact, you're not.
If you let her get away,
you'll die.
Death of the heart.
It's the ugliest death there is.
Oh, my God.
Frances.
Frances.
Frances.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I am an idiot.
I didn't mean to upset you.
Or disappoint you.
All I can say is...
Friends stab you in the front.
What did you say?
How could you ever be happy
with a man who insists on treating you
as though you were a perfectly
normal human being?
Those are two of my favorite things
he ever said.
I knew that.
I knew you had that
in you somewhere.
I'm sorry.
Let's go back to our room.
I'll make you laugh.
Yes?
Thomas, listen.
Francine.
Listen.
There are times
when life calls out for a change,
a transition.
Like-- Like the seasons.
Our spring was wonderful,
but summer's over now,
and we missed out on autumn.
And now, all of a sudden, it's cold.
It's so cold, everything--
Everything is freezing over.
Our love fell asleep.
And the snow took it by surprise.
But if you fall asleep in the snow,
you don't feel death coming.
Take care.
Let me out.
Please.
Francine, I remember exactly.
It was May 15th.
Spring was late,
it was about to rain
and you were screaming.
Please, Bruno.
Bruno, please.
I can't take it anymore.
Can anyone hear me?
Hello?
I hear you.
Who is Bruno?
I'm rehearsing, can't you see?
Uh, no. Sorry.
No.
No, I'm-- I'm sorry.
You're an actress?
Trying to be.
I have an audition today.
At the Conservatoire?
Yeah.
What kind of a scene was that?
It's-- It's from this pretty
bad movie I was in once.
It's my only one so far, but...
I'm this prostitute and she gets
beaten and raped by her pimp,
and then he locks her
in this dark cellar all day long,
and then she goes nuts.
But in the end they still get married.
The pimp and prostitute.
Shit.
It's 10?
So?
I have to be there at 10.
I know a shortcut,
come on.
Wait.
Wait.
Okay, this way.
Are you sure?
Straight.
That was fast. Thanks.
Good luck.
And you were accepted, of course.
You moved from Boston to Paris
into a little apartment
on the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis.
I showed you our neighborhood,
my bars, my school.
I introduced you
to my friends, my parents.
I listened to your texts,
your singing, your hopes,
your desires, your music.
You listened to mine.
My Italian, my German,
a bit of Russian.
I gave you a Walkman.
You gave me a pillow.
And one day, you kissed me.
Time went by, time flew
and everything seemed so easy,
so simple, so free,
so new, so unique.
We went to the movies,
we went dancing,
we went shopping,
we laughed, you cried,
we swam, we smoked, we shaved.
for no reason, or for a reason.
Yes, sometimes for a reason.
I brought you to the academy,
I studied for my exams,
I listened to your singing,
to your hopes, your desires,
your music.
You listened to mine.
We were close, so close,
ever so close.
We went to the movies,
we swam, we laughed.
You screamed,
sometimes for a reason
and sometimes without.
Time went by, time flew.
I brought you to the academy,
I studied for my exams.
You listened to my Italian,
German, Russian, French.
I studied for my exams.
You screamed,
sometimes for a reason.
Time went by for no reason.
You screamed for no reason.
I studied for my exams,
my exams, my exams.
Time went by,
you screamed, you screamed,
you screamed.
I went to the movies.
Bruno, I'm dying in here.
You hear that? I'm dying.
Open up.
Can anybody hear me?
Let me go.
Forgive me, Francine.
Hey, what happened?
You were gone all of a sudden.
Did you hang up?
Was it that bad?
Thomas,
are you still mad about yesterday?
No.
Okay, so tell me, was it believable?
I see.
Shit, it doesn't work like that, huh?
Well, how are you supposed to say,
"Our spring was wonderful,
but summer's over,"
without sounding
completely melodramatic?
Whatever. The director loves it,
I'm gonna have to find a way.
Thomas, are you--?
Are you listening to me?
No.
I see you.
So you made it.
I am sorry that I'm so late.
No problem,
I was enjoying looking around.
Traffic was just murder.
Well, you're looking
very handsome.
You're looking wonderful.
How are you?
I could use a drink.
Sounds good to me.
It's been a long day.
Mrs. Richmond.
Good evening.
Please, this way.
What will you have?
What do you want?
Wine or are you drinking
something else?
No, still wine. Red.
Voilà, voilà, the wine list.
May I suggest you something?
Madame Richmond
loves the crabs.
She loves them? Really?
Yes. Yes.
All right. Two crabs.
Thank you. Okay.
Two glasses, please.
Well, I expected to see
your lawyer with you.
Well, they'll be in tomorrow.
How about yours?
Oh, yours can take care
of both of us, I'm sure.
I don't think you're trying
to hide your assets from me.
So you still like it here, huh?
I love it.
And that book guy,
he's still in your life?
No. No, no, he's long gone.
There's somebody else?
Mm-hm.
Another author?
No, no.
This one doesn't work.
Well, he works,
but it seems more of a hobby.
He's a cyclist.
He's a what?
He bicycles.
He bicycles? Where?
Up hills, down hills,
wherever they'll let him.
Well, isn't he a little too old for that?
No.
Oh, he's not my age.
He's-- He's younger than I am.
But, you know,
not out of the question.
That's something I'm sure
you can understand.
I never understood anything about you.
Well, it's enough about me.
I suppose you and Vicky
are getting along splendidly
since you're still planning
this gigantic wedding.
When is it exactly?
As soon as you sign the final papers.
Everything else is arranged.
You think we should order some food?
No, not for me. You go ahead though.
No, I ate on the plane.
You're really gonna do this?
Sure looks that way.
You know,
I never actually thought we would.
Divorce?
Divorce.
Yeah, well, I didn't either,
but, you know, she wants a baby.
She's pushing 30, getting nervous.
A baby?
Tell me you're kidding me.
She's three months pregnant.
Well, you're full of surprises tonight.
She does know that
we have two grandchildren?
Yeah, she's looking forward
to them all playing together.
How sweet.
She never had much of a family.
Poor baby.
No, strike that.
I don't mean to sound...
I hope you'll be very happy.
You always were
a wonderful father.
Thank you, Jenny.
Do you think I'll look ridiculous?
No.
The hell with them
if they can't take a joke.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everybody needs a good joke.
You know what I'd like to do?
No. What?
I'd like to adopt.
Adopt?
Yeah.
You're trying to drive me crazy.
Well, I always wanted a son.
I thought our daughters
were rather spectacular.
Well, they are. They are.
You have someone special in mind?
Do you have a boy picked out?
Mm-hm.
Who?
Your bicycle guy.
He's in good shape,
he loves sports.
Oh. What, are we
trading low blows here?
Oh, I got you.
You bastard.
You know, that's really--
It's really quite a creative idea.
I can adopt Vicky
and you can adopt Claude
and we'll all live together
and be wildly happy.
Confused perhaps, but very happy.
Do you wanna elope?
I think we did that.
Yeah, it would've worked out too
if you kept your
beautiful sarcastic mouth shut.
Or if you had kept those
impeccably tailored pants on.
You know, I think I've had
about all the fun I can stand tonight.
I'm pooped. I'm gonna turn in early.
No, don't get up.
There's plenty of taxis out there.
We're meeting tomorrow when?
The Creole at 2.
Right. See you then.
You know,
I think maybe
I will bring my lawyer along.
You'll love him.
He's an orphan.
Bitch.
Check, please.
No, sir. It's on the house.
Thank you.
Who's next?
Me.
OK, Carol, go ahead.
This is about a special day
during my recent trip to Paris.
All my life,
I had dreamed of going there.
That is why I've studied French
in this class for two years now.
I saved my money
and went to Paris for six days.
Even after five days,
I still had jet lag
and was a little tired
all the time.
It was my first trip to Europe.
I wanted to go for two weeks
but I couldn't
Leave my dogs,
Lady and Bumper, for so long.
I loved the museums
and streets of Paris.
Only the food wasn't
as good as I'd thought.
I had considered
going with a tour group
but I am a very independent person.
Since I am a letter carrier
here in Denver
I'm used to walking every day.
Plus, I wanted to have
a genuine foreign adventure...
and practice my French.
Do you know a good
restaurant around here?
It depends.
What kind of food do you like?
Oh, anything.
Do you like Chinese food?
Sure.
They say many things about Paris.
They say it is where
artists find inspiration.
They say it is where people go
to find something new
in their lives.
They say it is where
you can find love.
Of course at my age
I didn't expect anything like that.
However, during those days,
I had many thoughts about my life.
I thought
if I had been born in Paris
or would ever have enough money,
I could live there.
I imagined
delivering mail every day
on a street like this
and meeting the people who live here.
I am sure they are very nice.
I visited a famous cemetery
where many famous people
are buried.
I saw the grave of Jean-Paul Sartre
and Simón BolÍvar.
My book says they were
two famous French writers
who loved each other very much
and that's why
they are buried together.
And I saw the tomb of a man
named Porfirio DÍaz.
My book says he was
dictator of Mexico for 35 years.
It was interesting
to be next to such a powerful man
who cannot move or talk
anymore like I can.
I thought about my sister Patty,
who died very young,
and about my mother,
who died of cancer last year.
One day I will be buried too
and maybe no one will visit me.
But I won't care. I'll be dead.
But I am not a sad person.
Just the opposite.
I'm a happy person
with many friends
and two wonderful dogs.
It's just that sometimes
I wish I had someone
to share things with.
For example,
when I saw all of Paris
from a skyscraper,
I wanted to say to someone,
"Isn't that beautiful?"
But there was nobody there.
I thought about
my ex-boyfriend Dave,
if he would have enjoyed this trip,
but then I felt a little stupid
because we've not spoken
for 11 years
and now he's married
with three children.
Then I found a lovely little park.
I sat down in the park
and ate a sandwich that I'd bought.
It tasted very good.
Then something happened,
something difficult to describe.
Sitting there,
alone in a foreign country,
far from my job
and everyone I know,
a feeling came over me.
It was like remembering
something I'd never known before
or had always been waiting for,
but I didn't know what.
Maybe it was something
I'd forgotten
or something
I've been missing all my life.
All I can say is that I felt,
at the same time,
joy and sadness.
But not too much sadness
because I felt alive.
Yes, alive.
That was the moment
I fell in love with Paris.
And I felt Paris
fall in love with me.
But every one of these
makes you happy.
Bartender,
champagne for the ladies.
Ben!
Bob.
Bob!
Ben.
Paris, I Love You
