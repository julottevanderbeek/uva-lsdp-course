"Into the Great Wide Open"
All clear.
Thank you for coming over
and for parking a block away
and for leaving at 5:00
in the morning.
Well, what can I say?
You're worth it.
I just really want my business
to stay my business, you know?
I'm not some
crazy psycho chick
- who can--
-
Go, go, go,
go, go, go!
Hug the shadows!
Hug the shadows!
- Monster!
- Aah!
-
- I am so getting you back.
Don't.
I hate being scared.
Oh.
Why are you even up?
Because my stupid baby
woke me up.
Better question is why are you
wearing full makeup?
I'm not ready for Josh
to see my morning face.
So I set 2 alarms--
One at 4:00 and one at 5:00.
I get up and do my hair
and makeup.
I go back to bed, fake asleep
until the next alarm goes off,
and then he thinks I wake up
looking like this.
- Crafty.
- I think so.
Is the sex worth it?
I'll have
to let you know.
I decided after that last guy
to reinstate my 10-date rule.
Oh.
But I should not have
let Josh sleep over.
The whole night
I spent playing defense.
- Nice.
-
What are you doing here?
Do you not get how divorce works?
I gotta give
a golf lesson at 6:30,
so I'm just gonna steal
a cup of coffee.
Well, then okay.
-
- Oh, morning, honey.
I need to study
for my advanced calculus test.
Hey, buddy,
you want some help?
Yeah, you're right.
Who am I kidding?
Can you take Stan
so I can get ready for work?
I'd bring him in the shower
with me,
but he always
pees on my feet.
- Hey, Bobby!
- Hey!
- Much love. Much love. Mm!
- Mm!
That's a long hug there,
big guy.
-
- Travis!
I'm up!
What's the deal with
the golf cart outside?
Mm, my car died,
so I kind of borrowed that
from the golf course
as, you know, a substitute ride.
- It's a hybrid.
- Genius.
Just 'cause
it has a plug,
doesn't make it
a hybrid.
It hauls ass.
You want a ride to work?
Uh, definitely.
Oh, that's not happening.
-
- Travis!
Thank you.
I can't believe
I am up at 5:00 A.M.
'cause this idiot
dropped his binky.
Before I had my baby, the only
time I was ever awake this early
was in my 20s, and I was still
up from the night before.
I remember this crazy night
that started out in New York
and ended up in Miami...
There I am.
I'm 23 years old.
I'm eating a 5-pound Belgian
waffle at 4:00 in the morning,
and I realize the Croatian chick
has got a gun.
...Until it ended,
'cause up until that point,
I had partied...
And I am talking
legitimately partied--
for 45 nights in a row, baby!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
What?
It's your turn.
Best war story
from your 20s.
Um, okay, uh,
once when I was 22,
I had a baby,
and I stayed home by myself,
raising him,
for the rest of my 20s.
The end.
Boo!
You know, I don't want to play
this game anymore, okay?
Let's go. Out of the kitchen.
Come on.
Can I just grab
a cup of coffee?
No. I can't deal.
He drinks every sip
like it's the most delicious
thing on the planet.
Do you know
how annoying that is?
Oh, sweetie,
I want to pretend to care,
but I just don't think
I can get there.
I feel ya.
Yi yi yi yi yi yi!
What the hell is wrong
with you?!
I'm just trying
to be a good mom.
Good morning, Grayson.
Hey.
- I've been up for hours.
- I had eggs for breakfast.
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought we were sharing
incredibly boring facts
about ourselves.
When you act like you
don't want to talk to me,
it just makes me
want to talk to you even more.
That may be the world's most
annoying personality trait.
Right? Do you ever get
that overwhelming feeling
that you just missed out
on everything?
I don't have
overwhelming feelings.
Would you, come on?
We--we are both recently divorced,
and we're going through
this stuff.
You know what?
This should be our thing.
We talk when we get our papers.
We can be paper buddies.
No, thank you.
Now I just want it
even more!
Blah, blah, blah.
ANDY: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-
hoo-hoo!
Ahh! Don't tell Ellie.
Later, J-Bird.
Ohh! Holy crap,
that's good coffee.
I know. Right?
Wait. What exactly was
upsetting you?
I don't know.
I was just so bummed
that I don't have one
good story to tell, you know?
Hold this
for a second.
Yes!
I spent so much time
on my hair this morning,
that felt like
cheating death.
I don't believe
in having regrets, Jules,
because in this great, big,
crazy thing we call life--
It sounds like you're
ramping up for a long one,
so first I have to ask--
Do you think
that's an appropriate outfit
for work?
I did until a second ago.
Fair enough.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
You're not gonna wear
trashy thongs.
I've got some emergency
work underwear in my drawer.
What I was
going to say is
that if you don't have
any good stories,
you can just start
making some now.
Are you changing your underwear
at my desk?
Who cares?
- I feel like I do.
- Jules, you can still have your 20s.
I mean,
you're halfway there.
You've already got the cute
boyfriend, who, for some reason,
you're still
not sleeping with.
I'm not sure what that means.
But the point is,
now all we have to do is
add in the fun stuff--
You know, barhopping,
road trips...
Eating pancakes
at 3:00 in the morning.
Crap, I love pancakes.
Come on an adventure
with me tonight.
The word "adventure"
makes it sound really fun.
- That's why I picked it.
- All right, I'm in.
- Yeah! Ow!
- Ow!
Oh, wait. I'm seeing a movie
with Ellie tonight.
So because you want
to relive your youth,
instead of getting a barrel
of popcorn and eating it
while we stare
at Viggo Something-son's ass,
I've gotta go get drinks with you
and your stupid, slaggy, townie friend?
Ellie's so excited
to come.
- Tell her to bite me.
- Laurie's psyched, too.
Oh, and, Ellie, um, we are even
for this morning.
- What?
- Monster!
I just made a horrible mistake,
didn't I?
Yeah.
All right, lipstick,
eyeliner, tissue,
granola bars, aspirin.
What else?
Stamps.
Stamps. Right.
Wait.
Why are you messing with me?
Because it's fun.
When you get older,
you need more stuff.
That's why I-I brought out
old Bessie here.
It's a purse.
It doesn't have a name.
Bessie does.
Have fun, for once.
Thanks.
You have fun at Dad's.
Well, this shouldn't be
embarrassing at all.
Helps with the bugs.
Good God.
So Ellie took a shower
with her baby,
and, of course,
he peed all over her feet.
But here's the kicker.
Ellie said afterwards
her skin
was so soft and smooth,
so of course I've gotta
find myself some baby pee.
But it's no biggie, 'cause
Ellie's just gonna hook me up.
You know, people can't unhear
the things you say.
Come back, paper buddy.
All right, I'll just see you
at your mailbox in the morning.
Not ever.
Ellie. I'm back.
You have to re-engage.
- Oh.
- On the plus side,
I was able to put peanuts in
her wine without her noticing.
Hmm. So witty.
Mm. I should probably slow down.
I'm getting a little buzzy.
These are just
the drinks that we get
we go out
and get drinks.
Oh, good.
She's here.
I've got a bad case
of the gotta-gos.
No, no. Don't leave.
Why don't you just come
with me?
No, I'm having fun.
I just want you to stay.
But this isn't
how I do fun anymore.
I've got much better wine
at home,
and I really need to take
my bra off. Enjoy your 20s.
So I invited my friend
Nezzie to roll with us.
Oh, that's great.
I love  with people.
Yo, this is really cool.
It's like drinking with my mom.
But don't worry.
She looks great.
- How old is she?
- 62.
I will kill her.
Here's the shots.
Oh, I didn't order one.
- Cheers.
-
- Aah!
- Aah!
- I'll get more.
- Ooh.
Did you see how tiny
her purse is?
You can't even put
a credit card in there.
She probably has to fold
her money into tiny squares.
Oh, I was right.
Jules, quit stalling.
Toss it back.
Just one, though.
Oh, wait, wait. I want to get
a picture with my phone.
Ready?
# All the single ladies #
# All the single ladies #
- # All the single ladies #
- # All the single ladies #
- # All the single ladies #
- # All the single ladies #
# All the single ladies,
now put your hands up #
# Up in the club,
we just broke up #
# I'm doing
my own little thing #
# You decided to dip
and now you want to trip #
# 'cause another brother
noticed me #
# I'm up on him,
he up on me #
# Don't pay him
any attention #
# Just cried my tears
for three good years #
# You can't be mad at me,
'cause if you liked it #
# then you should have
put a ring on it #
# If you liked it, then you
should have put a ring on it #
# Don't be mad
once you see that he want it #
# 'cause if you liked it #
# then you should have put
a ring on it, oh, oh, oh #
# If you liked it, then you
should have put a ring on it #
Jules!
Oh. Oh. Hello, gang.
I did not think
you were coming back
to see
the guest room again.
We're just gonna go look
around a little more.
You guys
take your time.
Party rookie.
How did  know?
That is upsetting.
Someone actually dared you
to make out with Barb's neck
for a second.
- I didn't, did I?
- No.
- Let me see that.
- No, no.
- Let me see it.
- You don't want to see it.
- Laurie!
- You don't want to see it.
Oh, there, it's gone.
It never happened.
-
- You know what's weird?
We par-tayed last night,
and I feel fine.
You're probably
still a little drunk,
- and you don't realize it.
- Oh, what, I'm gonna go home
and all of a sudden just have
some nasty hangover?
Oh, God.
Why?
Uh, sorry to intrude,
but I wanted to return this.
Oh, my... Ohh.
Help me.
Nah. Gotta go.
Ah. Bessie.
Are you okay?
My head hurts, I kissed Barb,
and Grayson made fun of Bessie.
Oh.
Does Andy still eavesdrop
every time you're on the phone?
I assume so.
Andy?
Right here.
Okay, tell Andy
to go over to Grayson's,
and make friends with him
and then be  to him.
We need you to go over
to Grayson's, make friends
- and then be mean to him.
- Fine.
- He's in. Go take a nap.
- Oh, thank you.
-
- What?
You said I should stop by
once your son left.
- Is that what I said?
- Uh-huh.
Okay, yeah.
Whoa! Andy, what's up?
- I brought over pizza and beer.
- Why?
You know...
I-I'm not sure.
Okay, well, I have to go
open up my restaurant, so...
I can't go home yet.
They'll just make me come back.
Lock the door
when you leave.
Ah. What a lovely turn
of events.
Oh, mother,
that's good beer.
You always have
to make the sound?
I do.
It's what makes it fun.
So fun.
Oh, I know it's frustrating.
But we only have
four dates left,
and when we get there,
it is gonna be amazing.
Maybe we could even, uh...
Nah, never mind.
What?
Just this crazy position
I read about,
but you're way
too classy for it.
and besides, it's more
of a young chick thing.
Tell me more.
Well, you just take
one of your legs
and just put it
over my arm.
Like this?
Oh!
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Oh, yeah! I'm great.
Why don't you go ahead and let
yourself out? There you go.
Yeah.
- Bye, Josh.
-
Okay, so you hurt yourself
by not having sex?
That's right.
I'm gonna get some take-out,
and do you remember
my aunt Carol?
The one
who hates my hair?
Yes. I'm gonna go
get my wedding video,
and we're gonna watch her break
her hip over and over again.
Ooh, I love it
when she screams and cries.
Hey, Laurie.
Nezzie's getting us
a free limo tonight.
I don't think
I can go out tonight.
It's done, girl.
But Saturday night's
the best night for going out.
She says
Saturday's the best night.
No! You're staying in.
Come on. We'll soak our hands
and feet in baby pee.
This is your 20s weekend.
Would you look?
You're an invalid.
Slaggy ho.
Do you know what people think
when they see you
out with those kids?
Don't say it
if it's too mean.
I mean, you're too old
for this crap.
You look pathetic.
Give me the phone.
Give it to me.
LAURIE:
- Give me! Give me!
-
- Laurie, I'm in. Come get me.
Ellie, go home.
What are you doing?
What are  doing?
I came out to get the mail,
and I got thirsty.
I'm a little hungover.
Hey, but thanks for checking
on me, paper buddy.
No, not your paper buddy,
just an annoyed neighbor.
Don't send tiny bald men
to my house.
Is Ellie watching us
right now?
We got into a huge fight.
You see, I feel like you
don't listen to what I say.
- You just move on--
- Turn around and catch her on three.
One, two--
Just do me a favor
and stop trying to drag me
into your little,
"Where did all the years go?"
Little nervous breakdown thing
you seem to be going through.
Three!
Ha! Ha!
Oh, I got you!
I wasn't looking at you,
you stupid head!
Does anybody on this block
like you?
Ooh!
Catch you later, P.B.!
Hey! That stands for...
"paper buddy"!
I just got a text.
Who's it from?
Someone named
Bitch-Slap Harris.
Huh. Good guy.
He's a college professor.
Of course he is.
Apparently, he saw a bouncer
being mean to Mom last night.
What? Why would anyone
want to be mean to Mom?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dad, Dad, I know those girls.
- Turn around.
- No detours.
We're running
low on juice, buddy.
Ah, ha ha! Aah!
Sarah, Tina...
Don't know you...
What's the haps?
Just drive.
Andy?
Hey, Jules.
You--you okay?
So Ellie had you call.
Oh, please,
girlfriend. I'm my own man.
I'm assuming she's so close,
you can't speak freely.
Yes.
I know she wrote you
a script,
so say something wrong
so I can catch her.
Uh, "When--when did
this whole 20s thing
start being about
something?"
something!
Proving!
Hang up the phone.
Go.
Ellie, I know
you can hear me.
I-I don't know when this thing
became about proving something.
It just did.
I hate the feeling that
I missed out on everything.
You--you have your stories.
I've heard all of them--
The night you were
in New York, Miami,
the--the month
you didn't see the sun,
the time
you kissed a girl.
Awesome!
I know that
I'm being crazy.
But when I'm being like that,
it is your job to support me!
I mean, remember when you
didn't smile at your baby
because you thought it would
give you mouth wrinkles?
I was there for you, Ellie!
It's hard for me
to be out there doing things
that I know are stupid,
and people are probably
talking about me.
But the last person I thought
who would ever say mean things
is my best friend!
Ellie, are you still there?
All right,
I'm going out.
You didn't smile at Stan?
Only for three weeks.
They want another round.
I feel like I'm 100.
You look like you're 800.
You know, I've seen
the endless parade of girls
you've brought home,
tagged and released.
No matter
how young they are,
you don't ever seem the slightest bit
self-conscious about your age.
I'm not.
Show me
how to do that.
I can't. You see, when women
get older, it's icky.
When men get older,
it's adorable.
It's actually
my favorite double standard.
- Yeah, I'm not a huge fan.
- Mm.
My, my.
I hurt myself hiking.
No, you didn't. Darling,
if you're going to attempt
a move like that, you gotta
hit the yoga class .
Hi. I'm Barb.
Wow.
Uh... Wait.
Where's your drink?
I don't even want it.
I'm just gonna borrow
some ice from this one.
- Ah. Ohh.
- That's it. You're done.
But Saturday night is
the best night for going out.
Sweetie,
it's time to go home.
I don't want you to have
to leave because of me.
You're going home.
It's Saturday night.
I'm going out.
Hey, Mom. What's up?
Why are you calling?
I just wanted to hear your voice
before I went to sleep
- in case I never wake up.
- T-minus five, Goose.
Okay, gotta go, Mom.
Love you. Bye.
This is for my mom!
Aah!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Oh, my God!
That was incredible!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Floor it! Floor it!
Hey. I saw that limo driver
help you in.
Did you come over here
to make fun of me?
No, I came over
to check on you.
So how are you?
Younger people just don't
get tired like we do.
I know.
But one day they will.
And if we're not dead,
I say we rub it in their faces.
I'm sorry
I was mean.
That's okay.
I'm never gonna have
my 20s again, am I?
Of course you are,
but just not two nights
in a row.
But you had a great
first night, right?
Yeah.
You never told me about it.
I bet you have great stories.
I do. Laurie sent some pictures
on my cell phone here.
Look at this.
Okay, this is me dancing.
Oh.
Um, that's a-a mean bouncer--
Oh, so mean.
That's, uh, that was
my first fistfight.
- I won.
- Cute.
This is me dancing on a pole.
I was just--
- That looks great. Yeah.
- Thank you.
And this is me eating
the world's largest pancake--
- so dadgum good.
- Oh, could we go get some?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Hi!
Oh, good.
You're chipper again.
I wanted to thank you
for the $6 of business
that you personally gave me
last night in an effort to show
that you could still hang
with the youngsters.
Why do you always have to--
Hey, wait a second.
You're out here with
your paper waiting for me!
To make fun of you.
It still counts.
You're my paper buddy!
Nuh-unh.
I was--I had to--
- I was reading--
- Sorry, P.B. I gotta go.
You save that
for tomorrow.
Damn it.
