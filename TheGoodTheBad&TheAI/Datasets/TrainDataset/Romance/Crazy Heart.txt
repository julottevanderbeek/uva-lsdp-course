Welcome to Pueblo.
I'm proud to meet you, sir.
Hey there.
I've been listening to you
for a hell of a long time.
Did you have a good trip?
Long, but good. Yeah.
Played Clovis, New Mexico,
last night.
I saw some pretty country.
Glad to be here.
Well, down there is the bandstand.
I'll catch up with you later,
but sure is good to have you, Bad.
Makes my day. And there's
no smoking' in the alley,
but you can sure finish that one.
I'll take a McClure's up
with a beer back, darling'.

Mr. Blake.
{ Clears Throat }
We have a real nice room for you
over at the Starlight Inn,
and, of course, all your meals
are taken care of, but, uh-
I'm afraid we can't let you run a bar tab.
It's in the contract.
Damn.
Mr. Greene of Greene & Gold,
he put that in himself.
Did he?
Yes, sir.
Well, if you and Jack have an agreement,
we're going to have to stick with that.
But don't you worry yourself about it.
- How much?
- 4.75.
Mr. Blake, let me personally offer you
all the free bowling you want.
Hold that, would you please?
Yes, sir.
{ Cigarette Sizzles }
{ Man On Phone }
Hey, Bad, this is Jack.
Listen, I didn't want to tell you this till you
came off this swing, but-
The label cut So Sweet, So Bad.
Huh? Why, that fucker's still selling'.
Well, it was slowing' down a lot. You
know what? Chains don't want it anymore.
Plus Tommy Sweet's
got nine albums out there now.
What about his new album? I'm going to
get off the road here in a couple weeks.
I can get right to it. Tommy wants
to know if you got any new material.
Oh, shit. New material.
You know I don't have any new material.
Nothing' wrong with the old stuff.
Tommy thinks he's leaning
too heavy on the old stuff.
He doesn't want people
to think he's riding the gravy train.
That son of a bitch.
He has a lifetime pass on the gravy train.
Hey, Bad, who's asking who
for a record here?
Jack, you jerk-off. You get your ass out here
to Clovis-goddamn-New Mexico,
you play in the piano bar
of some fucking' bowling alley,
get up the next morning at 5:00
and drive 300 miles...
with haemorrhoids so bad feels like
you got a nest of fire ants up your ass,
then you tell me about the gravy train.
You and Mr. Word Famous
Tommy Sweet- both of you try that sometime.
- Why don't you sit down and write some songs, huh?
- Keep talking'. Keep talking'.
Jesus God! { Sighs } What's
the matter? Can't do it anymore?
{ Muttering } I'm tired of listening
to your griping at everything.
You
- You're capable of it. Jack.
You keep going' out every fucking' night
drinking. Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.
I'm 57 years old.
I'm broke. I got $10 in my pocket.
I sent you money
when you were still in Texas.
So spend it wisely, my friend.
Yeah. Fuck you. Good-bye.

But we're going' to the show tonight.
And if you could sing
"I Don't Know" for Beverly-
You got it.
it'd mean the world to her.
"I Don't Know" for Beverly. Yes,
sir, old buddy, you can count on it.
Oh, hey, come here. Come here.

to start rehearsing'.
Why, just as soon as you can
and as often as you can.
That's the secret.
Uh- Um, Mr. Blake?
Mr. Blake?
Sorry to bother you. Um, I was just
wondering' what time you were coming' over.
Come here.
Yeah, I got some- some lead sheets here

Uh, Mr. Blake?
It'd really mean a lot to us
if you come over a little early-
{ Coughs } and we got
to go over some leads.
Lead? Son, are they paying you
more than they're paying me?
I just thought maybe you could show us
some of that old stuff...
like Bad's Boys used to do.
You taught Tommy Sweet
how to play guitar, didn't you?
Listen to the CD. Listen good,
and, uh, go over those lead sheets.
I'll be over there in about an hour.
I'm going to grab some supper.

That means the world to me.
I'm Wesley Barnes.
Mighty fine, Wesley.
You work before?
Oh, when I was a kid.
I just do this for fun.
Oh.
Well, for fun
and a couple of extra dollars.
Well, sure nice to run into
somebody on the road who really is good.
It's going to be a pleasure.
Can I ask you a favour, Mr. Blake?
"Bad," buddy. "Bad. "
What can I do for you?
You know, I hate to impose,
especially since we just met.
But, see, I got this niece,
and she's a writer.
She's trying' to be a writer.
She writes locaI here in Santa Fe.
I mean, it's not the New York
Times or anything, but anyway-
She writes about music, and she would
love to do an interview with you.
Ah.
Well, I haven't done
one of them for years,
but, yeah, you send your little niece around.
- I'll be glad to help her out.
- Oh, great.

I'm here for the interview.
Oh. Oh. Uh-
Yeah, I just, uh- I just
got out of the shower. I'm having' dinner.
I'm sorry. I'll just come back.
When's a good time for you?
No, no, no. Just wait outside.
Let me get my clothes on.
All right.
Jesus God.
Be right there.
All right.
Hi. Come on in. I'm so
sorry. I should have called.
No, no.
Uh, no- No pictures.
You want some steak or... a potato
or something? No. How about later?
Which?
Pictures. Maybe on stage.
Oh, that'd be all right.
All right. You want no roll or nothing'?
All right. Sit on right down. Thank you.
All right.
Mind if I eat?
No.
Tape recorder okay?
Go ahead. That's fine.
All right.
You always dress for dinner?
So, how'd you learn music?
Mmm. My daddy.
He had this old Washburn steel-string.
He couldn't play a lick on it.
I, you know, picked it up,
started fooling' with it.
- Guess that's how.
- Right. And what were you listening' to?
Bunch of people
you probably never heard of.
Lulu Belle and Scotty, Emmett Miller.
Georgia Wildcats. You ever hear of them?
Uh, no, I never heard the Georgia
Wildcats. Nah, I didn't figure you did.
How about Hank Williams?
Mmm. Gene Autry?
You know, Waylon and them boys?
Right. Lefty Frizzell?
- You want a drink?
- No, thank you.
So, you said-
You feel like your music is also
influenced by the blues? Oh, yeah.
Son House, Big Bill Bronzy.
We all owe our existence
to them Delta boys.
You ever want to do anything else?
Play baseball.
I was pretty good, too,
you know, for a while there.
I couldn't hit the curveball.
Well, I just figured
I'd stick with the guitar, you know?
Son of a bitch stayed
where he was supposed to.
How about you?
You always want to be a writer?
I didn't know
what I wanted for a long time.
But now you do?
Well, now I know what
I don't want to do again.
Yeah. Amen.
{ Chuckles }
- You married?
- I was.
One of those things
you don't want to do again?
Not unless it's right. Yeah.
How the hell do you know?
Well, you tell me.
You've been married five times.
Jesus Christ. Four times.
Come on. Four times.
You going to make another album
with Tommy Sweet?
Two things I don't want to talk about-
multiple marriages and Tommy.
Right. What's your real name?
I'm Bad Blake.
I wasn't born Bad.
When I die, my tombstone
will have my real name on it.
Until then, I'm just going to stay Bad.
It's an awful long time
for people to have to wait to find out.
Mmm. Maybe, maybe not.
You a daddy? You got any kids?
Sweetie, I'm going to have
to start getting' going' here.
All right. Can you give me
just another half an hour after the show?
Well, let's see how it goes, huh?
I appreciate you having to do
your work. I understand that.
But let's just see how it goes.
Okay. All right. Thank you.
So, Wesley's,
uh, what, your cousin?
He's my uncle.
Oh.

Oh, that's better than me.

I was thinking, if you weren't doing
anything after the show tonight,
we could get a late dinner...
or cup of coffee.
Well, I would, but I promised
a reporter an interview.
That's all right.
I know you're in town
for another night.
Another time would be fine.
I got to get back to work.
{ Chuckles } Uh, could you play
"Get a Hold on You" for me?
I'd Love to- right now.
¶¶  { Band }

¶¶ I've been loved

¶¶ All my life
I've been a Rollin' stone ¶¶
¶¶ Done everything
that a man can do ¶¶
¶¶ Everything
but get a hold on you ¶¶
{ Laughing }
So, how did you-
You played a gospel
song in a bar. I did.
How'd you get away with that?
How'd you know?
If you'd been doing' it as long as I have,
you'd know those things.
Here you go. { Chuckles } All right.
Cheers.
What else you want to know? Records.
What's your favourite?
Oh, I've have to say
"Falling and Flying. "
It made me a lot of money, that song.
Turned my whole life around.
- You get tired of playing it?
- When I have to play it twice, three times a night.
But, you know, it's been too good to me.
Can't turn my back on it.
So, in today's world
of artificial country music,
who's real country?
What?
{ Chuckles }
{ Laughing } Was that a stupid question?
Mmm! Hmm.
Is Tommy Sweet real
country? Tommy, oh, yeah.
He tries covering' it up.
I taught him country, you know?
He won't admit it. He's got to compete
with what's coming out of Nashville today.
But, yeah, he's real country.
How'd you meet him?
{ Exhales }
I don't want to talk about Tommy.
All right.
What do you want to talk about?
I want to talk about how bad
you make this room look.
I never noticed what a dump it was
until you came in here.
{ Chuckling }
I haven't seen somebody blush
in I don't know how long.
Well, I can't help it.
My capillaries are close to the skin.
Where you from anyway?
I'm from Enid, Oklahoma.
Of course you are.
What's the most important thing
about you, Oklahoma?
I've got a son- Buddy.
He's four.
He's at his babysitter.
I'd better go get him.
{ Notebook Closes }
Thank you for talking to me.
Did you get what you need?
Could always use more.
Yeah, well-
Come to tomorrow night's show.
We can continue where we left off.
All right.
Okay then.
Nighty-night.
Hey, Bad. I got great news for you.
Now, I'm busting' my ass on this.
So write it down.
Cancel Benson, Arizona,
on your itinerary.
You're into Phoenix, Arizona,
Sun Pavilion. 8:00 sharp. How's that?
Pavilion?
Hey, I just called to tell you you're out
of the Red Bison Lounge...
and you're opening
a major show in Phoenix.
Opening?
Shit, I don't open-
Bad, cut the shit. Now, where else are you
going to play in front of 12,000 people?
- Open for who?
- You're opening for Tommy.
No, no. No. No goddamn way.
I haven't been able to convince him
about doing the record yet.
But at least I got him to agree to
this. No, I'm not going to do it, Jack.
I'm not going to open for Tommy.
I'll open for somebody else, but not Tommy.
Who else are you going to open for? You're going
to open for Madonna? You want me to call her?
The dream of every sideman
is that someday the front man,
whose ass he's been staring' at for years,
is going to open for him.
I don't owe Tommy Sweet that dream.
I don't owe him a fucking' thing.
We both know Tommy owes you big.
But we also both know
how much this is worth.
I'm going to call you back this
afternoon. There is no time, Bad.
Yes or no? I've got to have time
to think about this. Come on.
No time. Yes or no?
Yes, goddamn it! Yes! Yes!
Yes. Fuck, yes.
All right.
Okay. Jesus Christ.
It's like pulling' it out of you.
Now don't fuck it up, all right?
Hey, let me ask you something.
Am I going to actually get to go backstage
and meet Tommy and everything?
That's very funny, Bad,
but I don't have time for this shit.
Good-bye. See you Later,
you fucking' asshole.

¶¶ Never see it coming'

No, no, no. Bear. Bear. Bear.
I need kick and snare.
Turn down the damn guitars.
You're drowning out
my lyrics.
The mix is good, man.
You can't hear
what I'm hearing out here.
Yeah, you'd be surprised.
Set it the way I tell ya and leave it.
The mix is just fine, man.
Trust me on this.
Bear, I'm an old man.
I get grumpy. Humour me.
Damn sound men.
They try to fuck up the opening act.
You know? It makes
the headliner sound that much better.
That's their fucking' job.
You got another
half hour there, cowboy.
Hey there, partner.
We're going to be up on this stage
till we get the mix the way I want it.
You set the mix the way I want it,
or I'm going to be up here rehearsing
right through Tommy's set.
{ Exhales }
All right. Let's take it
from the top of the bridge.
Let's see how Bear does.
One, two, three, four.

Now the guitars are sounding right.
¶¶ Never see it coming'

Tommy! Can we get a picture?
{ Chattering }
Oh.
Well, well. Heard you might be here.
You son of a bitch.
Sit on down.
You always knew
the right thing to say.
How the hell are you, Bad?
I'm worse.
That's about right,
I reckon.
What, you give up
on the Southern Comfort, huh?
I still drink it on stage.
It's good for the throat.
Yeah, that's what they tell me.
Too damn sweet for me.
Hell, I never liked it either.
But when you're one of Bad's Boys,
you got to be able
to put away the whiskey.
I'm sorry. I-I hate to interrupt.
Can I get an autograph,
Tommy? Thanks.
Sure.
You're my favourite.
I-I got all your records.
Thank you.
But this is the, uh-
This is the autograph you need.
That's Bad Blake.
Taught me
everything I know.
Cool.
Great. Thanks.
I'll be at your show tonight.
I may even make it
to San Diego.
Appreciate your support.
I was thinking' about-
about our tours together.
{ Smacks Lips }
They were
some good times, boy.
Oh.
Look, I'm really glad
you agreed to do this, Bad.
Oh, God. Are you kidding'?
I need the money.
Wasn't for this,
I'd be playing some saloon
in Benson, Arizona.
{ Chuckles }
Yeah.
You remember that time
we, uh-
we broke down on the desert
in West Texas?
{ Laughing, Coughs }
Sat out all day waiting
for that goddamn wrecker.
Well-
Just you and me
and a case of warm beer.
Those were the days.
Yeah.
Isn’t remembering wonderful?
How's the tour going?
It's a grind.
Fifty dates
in two months.
Oh.
How about yours?
I'm out for a month.
Six states.
Pickup bands?
Yeah.
That's a ball buster.
Hell, we should've gotten together earlier,
done the whole tour.
{ Coughing }
We tried that.
There was just too much going' on, Bad.
That damn movie shoot down in Mexico.
Jill was on my ass
all the time.
Yeah.
Would've been
a hell of a tour though.
Oh, yeah. Hell of a tour.
Aw, shit.
I'm sorry, Bad, it didn't work out.
I was trying' to keep
my marriage together.
Don't hold that
against me.
I got a career too.
And a marriage or two
I wanted to hold together.
I know. I know.
{ Sighs }
You gave me my start, Bad.
Don't think I don't remember that.
But I got a life too.
Well, well.
Those are the ugliest
goddamn boots
l've ever seen in my life.
Was the salesman threatening'
to shoot your dog?
Oh.
{ Coughs }
{ Laughing }
Hey. How come
we're not doing' another album?
Why won't you do it?
Hold up now.
I never said I wouldn't.
DMZ just doesn't think
it's the right thing to do. That's all.
Mmm, I think it is.
Well, you may be right.
They want a couple more solos first.
Then we do a duet.
And you got first shot.
I already told them.
You know, I need money now.
I'm 57 years old.
Career's going' nowhere.
I need something
to get it jump-started.
They won't give me
a damn solo album.
I need this, goddamn it.
I really do.
I swear, Bad. I can't get them
to budge on this one.
But there is a way you can make
some money if you want to.
Enlighten me.
Songs.
I isn’t got no new material.
Everything I'm hearing is straight crap.
You write me five new songs,
I'll give you back end.
I ship two million albums
every time I release one.
I haven't written a new song
in three years.
Too many goddamn songs.
You write some of the best
material out there, Bad. I want some.
Wrote. Wrote. Not write.
Well, I'm glad to see
you still got old Bessie.
Ah, she runs like a top.
{ Engine Starts }
Do it, Bad. You got a couple months.
See you tonight.
{ Crowd Chattering }
Mr. Greene
has sent five boxes of product...
for you to sell here at the show.
Sell? What are you talking' about?
He sent 500 units
of Memories for you to sell.
Aw, shit. I sing, I play.
I don't sell my goddamn records
at my concerts.
Tell him to get his ass out here to Phoenix
and pick up his goddamn CDs.
I'm just delivering

Oh, thinking' about you.
Now stop it.
Are you thinking' about me?
I'm finishing my article actually.
That's not what I meant.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, I got a couple days off
before I got to be in Houston.
I was thinking about stopping by.
What do you think?

You're not making

Hello, Mr. Blake.
Just sit back. Relax.
Where am I now?
You're in Santa Fe.
You have a broken ankle.
You also have a concussion.
Where's my- my guitars?
They're in the closet
with your clothes.
Oh. Got to get outta here.
When you can go
is up to the doctor.
Where's the doctor?
I'll get the doctor for you.
Just sit back. Just relax.
We'll get the doctor.
Let me be honest with you, okay?
The problem isn't your ankle.
It will heal cleanly.
The problem is
your general condition,
or the extreme lack of it.
Now, the kinds of stuff we're talking here-
emphysema, heart failure, cancer,
an extremely good chance
of a stroke-
are going to kill you.
- { Sighs }
- Are you going to talk to me?
About what?
Look.
Let's not kid ourselves about this one.
You're an alcoholic.
I'll take care of your leg,
give you something for your cholesterol.
But you have to stop smoking,
stop drinking...
and lose 25 pounds.
{ Patting }
Okay, Mr. Blake?
Ah, geez.
If I'm half as good about being
laid up as I think I'm going to be-
Okay, you need to
hush now, seriously.
Why? Am I rambling'?
Must be those blue pills.
Think I can get a prescription
or two of those?
No!

You're sure you've heard 'em before.
You wrote that?
Yes, ma'am, just now.
This is so unfair.
What?
Some people give
to do something like that,
and it just- it just pours out of you.
You mad at me?
You want me to go
to a motel?
No.
What?
I don't want you to go.
Well, what then?

Well, you're writing' a song on my bed.
So?
So...
every time I lie down,
I'm going to hear
that beautiful goddamn song,
and-
And you're going to be out there...

not even remembering' this day...
that I can't even forget.

I'd come to you.

or co written by you
over the next two years.

- Holy shit.
- This is going to be your best year
in the Last seven.
And you know who's responsible?
Tommy Sweet.
So do me a favour.
Ease up on him, will you, pal?
Tommy?
Yeah, Tommy.
Yeah, you got me.
All right, I'm going to
talk to you in Houston.
And don't marry your friend.
I'm-I'm not getting' married.
Listen-

Bullshit.
You want to call him back and tell him
I'm not about to marry you?
You might want to wait
till I ask before you turn me down.
I'm going to sleep on the foldout.
it'd be too confusing for Buddy.
No, I'll do that.
No, no.
No, no. You need a bed.
It's all right. I want to.
I'm going to go get him.

I don't blame him.
I was wrong.
I had no right to call him.
Wait. Hold on.
You was wrong 25 years ago
and you've been wrong since.
But you called him.
Now you're not wrong.
You're right. He's wrong.
Wayne, I went 24 years
without trying' to find him.
He's right.
Too little, too late.
No.
Never too late, son. Never too late.
You called, and it's done.
All right? It's complete.
Now, you're on the right track.
You just-just keep going',
'cause he's your son. Right?
Well, he's all I got.
Well, you keep after him.
Do what you got to do.
It's like, you know, you reminded me.
That song by Billy Joe Shaver.
I'm going to live forever. I'm going to cross
that river when I catch tomorrow now.
Oh, yeah.
Goes something' like-
¶¶ Nobody here will ever find me ¶¶
¶¶ I'll always be around ¶¶
¶¶ Just like the songs
I leave behind me ¶¶
¶¶ I'm going to live forever now ¶¶
Listen to this now.
¶¶ You fathers and you mothers
Be good to one another ¶¶
¶¶ Please try to raise
your children right ¶¶
¶¶ Don't let
the darkness take 'em ¶¶
¶¶ Don't make 'em feel
forsaken ¶¶
¶¶ Just lead 'em
safely to the light ¶¶

Hello?
Hi.
Hey!
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
- You didn't sound like
you were all right yesterday.
You sounded like
you were dying a slow death.
Oh. Think it must've- I don't know-
been food poisoning or something.
Well, I'm calling because
I got four days off at the end of this month,
and I thought we might come.
Oh.
But I'm not sure it'd be
such a good idea.
What are you talking about?
It's a great idea. Why would you say that?
You sure you're okay?
I'm worried about you.
Don't waste a minute worrying about me.
There's nothing' wrong
that a visit wouldn't cure.
How's Buddy boy doing'?
He's fine.
So, you going to come?
{ Jean }
Can you reach it?
Hey, there. Oh, you got your car!
Go through the tunnel there.
{ Bad }
Well, I think he's had it.
You all right, Bud?
He's eating'-
He's eating' in his sleep.
{ Bad } What do you think of these
big buildings, huh, Bud?
I bet Superman couldn't even
leap over these things.
Right here in this town...
is where Sam Houston and his boys
beat Santa Ana and his Mexicans.
Wasn't for this spot,
we'd all be speaking' Mexican.
That's where Texas
got its star, right there.
You speak any Mexican, Bud?
{ Speaking Spanish }
Hey, that's pretty good.
{ Buddy Chattering }
Wow, Bud.
Where's that big turtle?
What do you see there?
Where'd he go?
I think there's
a lobster that was in here.
You getting' tired?
Oh.
He's got so much energy,
he wears me out sometimes.
Why don't you go back to that park?
Take a Load off.
Let Bud and I fool around, and we'll come
back around noon and take you out to lunch.
{ Jean }
All right.
Okay. You get your wish
in your head?
Huh? Here's the spot.
Here.
Pick one. Pick some.
You can have a bunch.
There you go. That's good.
{ Laughs, Coughs }
Here's mine.
Come on. Go!
That's it.
Hey.
Bud? You want to go inside
where it's cool?
Huh? Let's do that.
Come on.
Giddap!
Hey, sailor,
what say we go in this place right here...
and wet our whistle before it pop
out of the ground, huh?
Out of the ground?
Like that guy on TV?
What guy?
On TV.
Yeah, that guy. Come on.
- Hi there.
- How are you guys doing' today?
All right.
Take a load off there, Bud.
I'll take a McClure's if you got it. Yeah.
Yeah, make that a double.
Ginger ale for my paI here.
Make that a double too.
Like mine rocks, please.
How about you?
Rocks.
Well, looked here. Look at this.
Hey, you want to go explore? You can.
Oh, what'd you get? Huh?
Wow! Bud, you're getting'
all kinds of good stuff.
All right, amigo.
How about, uh, 12.50 altogether.
- 12.50? Jesus!
- { Chuckles }
Oh.
Does this music drive you crazy?
You know, if I heard it, it probably would.
All right, Bud. Come on.
Get your ginger ale.
Buddy?
He's probably in the restroom.
Buddy!
Come on, Bud.
Buddy?
Bud?
- Did he come back out here?
- No.
Buddy!
What the hell?
You see- You see a little boy
come in here?
Bud?
Oh, no.
Ow!
{ Grunting }
Uh, I lost my little boy.
Okay.
He's got brown hair.
Four years old.
His name's Buddy.
Buddy.
What was he wearing?
{ Sighs }
I don't-
I don't remember.
Okay.
Well, sir, where
did you last see him?
Uh, a bar, uh-
A bar.
Which-Which bar, sir?
Oh, hell, I don't know.
It was a little dark bar.
Okay.

Four years old.
{ Coughing }

{ Man On Radio, Indistinct }

No, I got to go find him.
He's lost. He's from New Mexico.
I'm supposed to meet
his mother.
I understand that.
We're going to find him.
But I need you to stay here.
All our guys are out looking for him.
All right, sir?
{ Breathing Heavily }
Sir, how much have you
had to drink today?
I had a drink.
A drink?
What goddamn difference
does that make?
Well, you lost him, sir.
Yeah, I lost him.
I'm going to go find him.

Where's Buddy?

What?
No need to worry.
No- Guys are looking for him?
I stopped
just for a second-
You stopped to get a drink?
Please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me. Excuse me.
Hi. I'm the mama
of the boy who's been lost.
Jean.
Jean, Jean-
I asked you
not to touch me!
{ Walkie-talkie Chatter }
- { Woman } Here you go, son.
- { Jean } Bud. Oh!
{ Bad }
There's my Buddy boy.
Come here, you.
You're going to be fine.
There's my Buddy boy.
Everything's
going to be fine.
Shut up.
We just got our wires crossed.
{ Clears Throat }
Jeannie, you can't go now.
You don't even have a ticket.
Come on.
God, I should've listened to
my instincts. Every fucking'-
Every single bone in my body
told me not to get on that plane.
- It's going to be okay, Jeannie. Just-
- No. Everything is not okay.
He's four years old.
He's scared half to death.
You know I wouldn't do
anything to hurt that boy.
Well, you did do something to hurt him!
You and every other man in my life.
Just nothing but
self-involved assholes.
Come on now.
Just calm down.
Oh!
Let me-
Now his backpack-
Jeannie. Can't we talk about it?
{ Crying } No, don't you touch me!
It's too fucking' hard! Stop!
Let me drive you to the airport.
Come on. I can do that.
Sorry, Bud.
Let me drive you at least.
Come on, babe.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Let me take that
for you.
Thank you.

I knew what the risks were with you.
And I took 'em,
because-

Putting' Buddy in your hands-
I don't know that I'll ever

I am too.
Let me show you.
You're not listening to me.
We can start over, Jean.
Listen to me. I am so-
I'm truly happy for you.
I hope you make
a really nice life for yourself.
But Buddy and I
can't be a part of it.
But I love both of you so much.
If that's true, you'll
leave us alone, all right?
Oh, come on, Jean.
Now don't say that.
