Here you go
Can I borrow it?
sure, but it's  in english
no problem, I'm going to borrow a dictionary
ok, try your best
I will
Hey! leave him alone
hey! what do you want!
run
Jiro! What's that all about!
stop bullying the younger students
How dare you...
Looks like you did something brave
I just fell off
Don't be involved into fights okay
Okay
Don't be involved into fights okay
Okay
go get some snacks
Thanks!
It's brother Jiro!
Welcome home Jiro
Jiro!
Welcome home Jiro
Welcome home Jiro
Jiro , let's go catch dragonflies!
Jiro!
Let's catch dragonflies!
You promised to come play with me
I need to study
You are not studying
It's an English magazine
He has a strange mustache
He is a famous Italian aircraft designer. His name is Caproni, seems he is a count

Jiro what happened to your face?
you are too noisy
you're wounded? let me cure it
Please be quiet..
Jiro, What are you doing here?
Kayo, you should not have come here
You are not wearing your glasses
I am looking at the stars without it. looking something far is good for the eyes
You will be scolded by mom
A falling star!
There's one more!
It's beautiful
There's one over there
Over there too!
I am a Japanese boy
It is supposed to be a dream! I think this is my dream.
Maybe we're in my dream
we are also in my dream
In your dream? we are together in each dreams?
It's mysterious , you are Count Caproni Earl right?
I am very glad to be able to meet you
It's interesting, probably this is not a dream, this world is a dream
Welcome to my kingdom
I am greatly honored
Look
They are going to bomb the city of the enemy , half of them won't be able to come back
the war is going to end very soon
Come up here you Japanese kid
When the war ends, I am going to make this thing
Don't you think it's geat?
take off
this will carry passengers instead of bombs
If there's something like this, it would be easy to dream
We can go wherever we want
Come over here! just walk along the bracket
Look
Isn't it beautiful?
Yes it's magnificent!
It will carry 100 passengers and cross the Atlantic ocean
Mr. Caproni, I have a question
If you are nearsighted, can you design aircrafts?
For me I wont be able to fly planes because I am nearsighted
Listen to me kid, I don't fly planes
or should I say I can't fly planes
There are lots of people who want to fly planes
but I am a person who make airplanes!
Cool!
Listen to me kid, aircrafts are not weapons of war nor means of trade
It is a wonderful dream, aircraft designers will build this beautiful dream
Right!
Well then goodbye!
Hey Jiro, go to bed and rest.
You were having a dream right? As if you were responding to someone in a loud voice
Mom, I want to be an aircraft designer
That's a great ambition
That person told me, airplane is a wonderful dream
I want to build a wonderful airplane
Madam, you can have the seat here, I'm going to move somewhere
you can sit now
It's really nice!
Miss, your hat might be blown away
I'ts fine
watch out!
Are you OK
I'm safe.
Are you OK
I'm safe.
Nice catch!
Thank you !
"Le vent se leve"

"Le vent se leve, il faut tenter de vivre ."
When the wind rises "you should look on the heart and mind"
Earthquake
The engine will explode!
What happened
Her feet
Let me take a look
It Hurts
Stay strong
She broke her leg, she can't walk
run before the engine will explode!
That's silly. don' believe that.
The engine won't explode
my trunk case
relax it
here we go
you can not walk
Where do you live?
Ueno
I'll send you off
There's fire
Let's keep going
Your luggage?
It's okay
sorry, sorry
Does it hurt?
Hold on
Let's go
It is a new cloth so it's clean
open your mouth
The well just ran out of water
How about you?
yes please
The fire hasn't reach the main street
I'm going to my former school, how about you two?
I'm going to call somebody from home
Let me go with you
Madam, can I leave my things with you
yes
Don't worry, I'll definitely come back
Okay
please look out for my trunk
yes
Thank you so much!
You're welcome
What's your name by the way?
He is a good man
You're back Jiro! you're back on a devastating day
How's the aviation institute?
The area might be on fire
We already brought out most of the stuffs
Do you have a smoke?
This is huge, I even see a door flying
The fire is spreading! Tokyo is burning
I really made it but the foundation is Mr Caproni's dream
Don't shoot!
The wind direction has changed. Fire is coming here!
Hey Japanese boy! Is the wind still blowing
Yes, the strong wind is still blowing
you must keep going then
"Le vent se leve, il faut tenter de vivre"
Jiro, Let's go.
okay
still old fashioned. Nothing has changed
But seems they widened the street
Even those planes  still look the same
Welcome
Jiro you're eating saba again!
because they are delicious
It's already a habit, same as the lectures in school
Ms Kimi, can you bring me an egg?
got it
It has become an era of aluminum already
you should eat tofu and meat sometimes. We are behind a decade already
What is it
isn't it a work of art?
it has an impressive curve
Do you always look on the bones when you eat mackerel?
just eat faster, we'll go get coffee after
Jiro seems really well motivated
the mackerel bone inspired him
Is Mr. Horikoshi back?
Jiro
Honjo I found out something
The bones of the fish is similar to that airfoil profile of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
I just wonder if Americans eat mackerel
Jiro someone is looking for you
Yes?
A while ago, a young girl came and asked me to hand this to you.
you were out so I took it
Thank you very much
Jiro is it a valentines gift?
Do you have a cigarette? give me a stick
Jiro
Let him go
You're back
I'm back
I led your visitor to your room. It's a girl
oh thanks
I hate you Jiro!
Oh Kayo! sorry, I totally forgot it.
--%!
How's mom?
she's at uncle's place
are you going to stay?
just for a night
Kayo you've grow a lot and  became prettier
Jiro, you don't care much! you never came home once
Oh it's getting late
I'll send you off, I am going to give my apologies
Let's go by steamboat
You must like her so much right?
no way, It has been two years already
Do you know what happened to the girl you helped?
it's been two years ago. I went to see her once after the fire
The fire burned down the entire house.
I see
we're here
Don't you feel cold?
I'm fine
I never thought Tokyo would be revived
Can I live here with you ?
Dad won't allow me to go to Tokyo alone
at that time, maybe I will already be in Nagoya
On an aircraft company?
yes
Guys are lucky. I am going to a university and study medicine
So you want to be a doctor. I think it suits you
Really? do you think so?
When I come back on New Year, I am going to talk to Dad
Thanks. I owe you.
Jiro
Hey you made it!
finally I'm here...      yeah finally
there's a lot going out of the city to do job hunting
I saw a lot of them on my way here.
some even sleep outdoors
there's commotion again
This time it's the kamehachi bank
Bankruptcy?
Yes Yes
There were some rumors
about the world recession
Our company might go into recession too
you came at a busy time, did you know what you came for
They said anytime on April will be good
despite you can show up on March
yes sir
I will let you join the team immediately
Yes sir
Did you prepare the data of the metal fittings?
yes sir
I'll let you do design, the engineering department seems to be less busy
okay
You'll work here
Please wait for a while
Come here
You can use the table here, it is for imports so no one has been using it
thanks
datas here, hats there
Listen everybody, I introduce you our new member
he is the said genius who's gonna be joining our team for Hayabusa.
Introduce yourself
I'm Horikoshi. Pleasure to meet you all
familiarize yourself to work
Yes sir
Hey Jiro
It' lunchtime. Let's go
oh, okay
Do you want to see the workshop?
yes I would like to take a look.
It's kinda strange.. people get chaotic to a newcomer who just arrived
Two lunches please
Good day, I have some favor to ask
oh, it's almost done
Sorry for bothering you on your rest time
No problem at all. I am happy to be visited by young designers
Honjou! It seems the metal fittings are already done
I never thought a beginner like you can be reliable, I wonder who is  better among you
he seems to be a fruit of a hardworking mother
Come over here, I wanna show you something
I want to hear your opinion
What do you think about this?
Seems to be a solid design
This part doesn't look good
Although the idea is the same.
That's not good
foreman, breaktime is over
be quiet
Airplanes are really interesting huh
yeah, we'll get late
I'm Hattori
This is Mr. Hattori, the director of the design department
Is this your first work?
It is a design of the metal fitting
it doesn't seem so
oh
Please explain this one
sure sir
To increase the rigidity of the fitting, I used a leaf suspension on this part
The use of wire rope and stretchable cable, absorbs the pressure that can penetrate in the middle bracket of the skeleton
So the skeleton wont be deformed
Yes that's right
but I haven't calculated that yet
Yes that's right
but I haven't calculated that yet
You are wasting time what is this crap you're doing?!
What happened to the work I gave you?
I already finished it
those are fine nice lines
perfect! you should submit as soon as you're done
got it
Hey , I'm going home now
I am going home now as well
How about your task given by Mr. Kurokawa?
It's done
There are cows here
They will carry the new aircrafts to the plant ,it takes 2 days for 3 kilometers.
that's the new rule
I like cows
It's coming ! It's coming
Prepare to measure the time
here he come
No! Damn it!
Were you able to take it?
that's slow!
It should fly high 15km high, mobility is too low, engine is not maximized
Hey Mr. Black hat
Yes
Army officers are here
Good job! it was great.. very innovative design.
You' have a bunch of good people
He is driving speed of 400 km/hr!
it crashed!
the pilot!
Mr.Kurokawa, the collection of wreckage will be done when the rain stops
How's the pilot?
He's fine
thank god
Mr. Kurokawa, let's go back.
Let's go and start over again
Do you think the mid-air breakage is because of the metal fittings?
I don't think so. the problem might be deeper, broader or farther than we think
I have deep realizations today. I felt as if an endless road has opened in front of my eyes.
There's no more Hayabusa no.2. we already lost the army
they already took the other company.
This was the only chance we could have had.
Anyway our company is going to produce bomber planes for Junkers Company in Germany.
This is your chance to see Germany , I recommended you
Are you still open?
Oh you're back, you came late today
two Siberian cakes please
okay
here's your cake
who are those kids?
The parents hasn't come yet. they always wait there, I am closing soon
I see, Thanks
thank you for coming today
Hey Kids aren't you hungry? Eat this cake I just bought from the store
Take it
Let's go
are you home?
Too bad, I heard the project has been terminated?
hmm?
Siberia cake, you eat weird stuffs
did you expect that that girl would smile and thank you
No.   hmm maybe yeah
There are lots of hungry people on the street.
one metal fixture can feed that kids family the entire month
Why is this country so poor
Jiro
Do you know how much this engineering companies pay?
That amount of money is enough to feed the kids in Japan everyday, they can eat rice and cakes. so I have no plan of wasting the chance given to me.
Are you going too Honjou?
I've made up my mind just today
That's great
Because this poor country want aircrafts, so let's make aircrafts!
Tomorrow I am going to Tokyo, I'm gonna get married
Get married?
In order to be invited to this kind of work, one needs invitation. marriage is a contradiction.
Germans are so mean.
despite coming all the way here
they won't allow us on the plant
There are no cows here
cause the field is just beside the plant
So wide
it's G38, who would buy this.
they will make bomber planes in Japan, at the governments expense
Where the heck the army is planning to go
In America. maybe better not to know
this plane is well made
Isn't this awesome. there's a room that's converted into bomber's outlook on the wing.
Who cares anyway
Take this opportunity to  learn about metal!
they don't even show what's inside like it's supposed to be
It's beautiful
Hey Japanese, you are not allowed here!
Hey you! do not lay hand on him
Is this how the Germans treat visitors!
Japanese will copy right away! It's Germany's property
Don't be too proud
We have a lot of this old fashion things in Japan!
Honjou that's enough
We visited this plant to achieve technical expertise
There is reason why we joined this convention, there is unfairness to students based on the agreement
There is no instruction from your boss
that we are not allowed to go near anywhere
There are no questions of you doing your job
but insulting us out of the content of the agreement is unforgivable
We were ordered to look after for Japanese who wanders around
come here
It's Dr. Hugo Junkers
Yeah, a very fine man
Dr. Junkers gave his permission. I will guide you around
I never thought we can even ride it
It is shaky more than I expected
They seem very excited
Excuse guys, the army wants to try too
it's your turn
This aircraft is really good
There are channels inside the wings
this is awesome
if possibel inside the plant
Good Day! we are permitted here as researchers
please show us your work
This is the engineers position
This is a great airplane
Japanese, you can not go any further
got it bro! this is great
this is great
I agree
This is Germany's crystallization industrial technology
Dr Hugo is great, but their company who is very tight
Jiro do you have smoke?
Jiro
have some smoke?
I ran out
It seems pretty cold outside, good that it's warm in here
I though all people are warm here like this heater
maybe this is Dr. Junkers same as the airplane today, don't you think so?
It's great
enough of it.. I get it.
They say we have no foundation of our technology
a warm bath and a table with heater is fine
airplane and table with heater doesn't match
the data we got today is indeed wonderful
only the good and strong points are written
"The technology is Germany's property"
Honjou, I think airplanes and table with heater are related
wood and metal might not be
With that it's too late, we are already 2 decades behind
Let's go for a walk.
I need to calm my mind.
we are the Achilles chasing a turtle ahead 2 decades from us
catching up to a 20 years gap for 5 years
the turtle is 5 years ahead, we're gonna chase that 5 years in 1 year
that would be an endless chase
Now we can only do so there is always a catch even one day overtake
someday we will able to reach and overtake it
i wonder if there could be shorter roads for a turtle
What is it?
I hear a phonograph
Winterreise song. it pictures our journey
What was that?
It looks like the person from the hangar
Jiro, I finished bathing. it's your turn
he's fallen asleep
The Japanese engineer who bears alone the fate of our aircraft
come in
it's fine here
There was a telegram from the company, It was decided that few will stay and rest should go home
Honjou, you stay.
while Jirou will go to the west
to the West?
He was called to see the world
He is traveling alone?
Mr. Caproni
Is the wind still blowing?
yes. still blowing
come join me, to my retirement airplane
come with me
you are going to retire?
fly high
fly!
Hurry up! We are about to get going!
there is plenty of time to go up. come fast!
okay!
can you please close it
Let's Fly
They are all relatives of  my workers
the entire village
tokyo village is a secret
because their product are bombs
What do you think?
It's amazing!
it looks like the Roman buildings
well there is no need to bluff pair with Tokyo
authorities do not need to fight extensively
In fact, my country is very poor
Our technology can't even make this
getting closer to it is most important
sense will come first
then technology will go after
That's my family
In fact, my country is also poor
there are too many kids
Hoi! Do not get too excited ! we'll fall!
Come
Watch your head
Even in dreams, do not hit your head
Which do you prefer, a world with a pyramid or none?
pyramid?
There is a haunting dream on the dream of flying
Airplanes are weapons of mass and destruction
so it is burden of your fate
i see
Even for me, I chose the world with pyramid
So which one do you choose?
I want to build a magnificent airplane
are you referring to that one?
It looks great
the engine and cockpit has not been made yet
What a beautiful dream
this will be my last flight before retiring
you have 10 years of creative life
artists and designers are also the same
Use your 10 years to live fruitfully
Jiro , come let's have a talk
But I have a meeting now
postpone it
The demands are too high
it is always the case
Jiro , How many years have you been with the company?
Jiro
Ah
How long have you been with us?
Five years
I think it's already fair enough
That should be enough for you to become a chief designer.
For the prototype of army jet-fighter organized by navy
He has promoted you.
Jiro
what do you think?
let me do it
Very well
can I ask Honjou as a staff?
That's not a very good idea. You'll be competing
your friendship will be affected
Talk it over
Ms. Kimi, bill please
I have some task for Honjou
Domestic engine is such a crap.
The aircraft carrier is aboard.
your clean clothes are ready!
thank you so much
thank you for being generous
does it fit you well?
Man overboard!
It's flying! success!
Papa
Bravo! Nice catch
Thank you. were you hurt?
I'm fine
here is the umbrella
Thank you
we almost lost it. We could have been in trouble.
I have to go now
papa, I think I said something wrong
he is a nice boy
We stay in the same hotel so we have a chance to thank him there
What is it?
I saw the person who helped us with the umbrella
I wonder if he is with somebody
sorry, I should go back later
Please do not go.
I went here to pay my respect and give thanks
I prayed and asked that you would come here
you haven't change a bit
eversince that time we met
during the earthquake
Thank you so much
I always wanted to meet you,
to thank you face to face
Ah you're the girl during the ...
My name is Naoko Satomi
I'm Jiro Horikoshi
Are you OK
I'm fine
do you remember my maid
She got married 2 days before the incident
on the commemoration, she often cries a lot
Jiro, in fact you were our prince
a prince ?
Yes, you were a prince riding on a white horse
there is a leak on this umbrella
it's okay, I have to tell you more about her
She gave birth to her second child
the baby is very cute
Your paintings are already soaked
yes, it will eventually dry up
Look, the sun is working it out
it's already dry here
look over there
I already forgot how a rainbow looks like
Life is really beautiful, isn't it?
We should go, I'm sure my dad is worrying by now
papa...
you come with me, I'll  introduce you to my father
okay
you are totally wet
I'm fine. he helped me
He is Jiro Horikoshi
I'm Jiro Horikshi
I'm Satomi
seems My daughter has troubled you again
do you mind me sitting here?
not at all
This is German smoke, it's my last piece
kinda sad
I know the feeling
I had the same experience
So you've been to Germany huh?
In De Zhao City right?
Are you Sherlock Holmes?
I know you are an engineer, I always see you on German airplane magazines
All japanese engineers go to De Zhao City
Haha ~ you are totally right!
Dr. Hugo is going to end
going to end?
He is fighting against odds with the government
is it an envy from the political party
a rogue group
this is a cool place
there are no mosquitoes, it's not hot
Watercress is delicious
you can forget the unpleasant things
you wanna try this japanese smoke?
Thank you
nice music, it's Der Zauberberg
Thomas Mann's magic Mountain?
It is a good place for forgetting things
To forget about the war with China
to forget what Manchukuo has made
to forget being taken out from the League of Nations
to forget being the enemy of the world
Japan is recovering
Germany will also recover
Will Germany go for war again?
We must stop talking now.
Sorry to keep you waiting
actually Naoko has a fever
Please allow us to cancel our dinner for tonight
I understand. Please tell her to get well soon
I'll go look for a doctor.
Who hes ever seen the wind?
You nor I have seen it.
but when it quivers my face, the wind passes by
but when the wind soar and quivers
I'll send it to your side."
Jiro
Naoko
hold on
nice catch
is your daughter already well?
thanks, she is now
That's good. all will be healed on Thomas Mann's Magic Mountain
that's probably true
this guy seemed so lonely before
but now look at him, he is so alive
because he fell in love
Yes
this love will end so fast
love sickness? the mountain will forget
I'm not that kind
with.. don't say it's my daughter!
Yes, with Naoko
Please allow me to date your daugher
it's ok.... however
About that thing, please allow me to accept it
this is lovely
before anything else, we have something to talk about
two years ago, my mother died of tuberculosis
and I am also suffering from tuberculosis
I always have loved you
from the time you saved my hat
Me too, eversince the wind brought you to me
Will you marry me?
Yes... but I have to get well first
can you wait until that time
even if it takes a hundred years
Congratulations ... He is such a good young man
your daughter is also a fine lady
This summer is a great summer
Jiro! over here
Honjou! when did you come back?
the other day
it's hot here
Help me take a look at this.
It's beautiful...... this is good
It's an experimental machine
so you are free to do what you want
It's hard to figure out without an actual test
This will fly
the wind is blowing
Hojou you are the Achilles of Japan
The 20 years has shortened
Mine was a tin-plate duck type
Do you want to use this?
I was not able to use it on my duck plane
it is used on the test port cover rivets
to reduce air resistance
the hinges on the fuel inlets
will be more convenient for access
with this, I think the elasticity of the spring is enough
Jiro that's a great idea.. this is Columbus' egg
please use it
thank you
But not now
I'll keep this design
you are going to use it next time, so after you
please let me use this too
affirmative
I'm looking forward to use it
Jiro ! where are you?
Mr. Kurokawa.... Jiro
come back quickly..
yes sir
thanks. I will visit you in your house soon
okay
Jiro,, you pedal
Jiro, you are being investigated by the agents
you are a target of white-collar crime by the secret police
we told them you are not here and you are on a business trip
just go along with the plan, they pretend they left
Jiro stay here, your work will be brought here
please explain what happened.I am innocent
I have 2 friends who were arrested
they were innocent as well
come in
we're coming in
please bear with this for the mean while
Do you still need something?
go back as soon as you drop the things
Jiro it has arrived!! ... the beta prototype of the flange
it looks good... if only we had it a year ahead
Jiro.. How is it?
Next time the ducklings will become duck-mole
entirely a metal duck right?
Mr. Hirokawa how is it?
The duralumin era has already ended
Let's all go back!
I think no one is after us
none
Just to be safe, do not show up for 2-3 days
they will deal it until today
you can come to my place, it's distant from here
Please allow me to go to my dormitory, I'm expecting a letter
I think it would not be safe
It would be trouble if they find it.
It's fine but an undercover agent might appear
it is translated letter that contains profanity
regarding serious diligence to modern nation
you translated it?
Jiro you are just a human
That's funny. I though Japan is a modern nation
It's not a funny thing to laught at
Of course it's not. tell the agent posted in your place
that those are just like love letters
The next aircraft is coming soon. you will do it.
the company will do everything to protect you.
you are person who is very reliable
put your focus on the job
despite of that, we parted ways too soon
wherever he is, I'm continuously pray for his safety outside of the country
Jiro , you have a phone call
thanks
phone is over there
Thank you
Hello....... jiro it's me,  there's a telegram for you
The people here are worried....
it arrived 2 days ago.
please read it for me
is it okay?...
sure
Naoko . . . Cough . . Hemo...ptysis,, father..
hello.. are you still there?
yes. thank you very much
wait.. don't hang up.. hello
Please tell me the fastest way to go back to Tokyo.
to Tokyo?
Yes, I need to get back there
wait a moment
the bus will come at noon
you will reach the train station at 1pm
I'll somebody to assist you.. be ready
Jia.. Jia..
Jiro
I'm sorry, it took a while
I might infect you
you're beautiful
I love you
Jiro came through the back door
yes, come in
Jiro went to visit
But he needs to go back very soon
Next time I will use the main entrance
I prefer you coming through the back door
okay, I must do it again then
take care
you take care too..
I'm going ahead
I'll send you off
the last train? you must hurry then
if only I can stay here with her
I object..,I think you should to work
go hurry up
you're crying
I think I will take the doctors advice. I am going to the Hospital in the mountains
that place is sad.., you will be alone
I want to live to be with Jiro
you're just right on time.. the top management is waiting
well then?
I will do my best
Next will be the navy
I will do my best
you were not listening
yes
then it was cancelled
it's greatly taking time.... oh chief
seems a study class about accomplishments
oh
Next is the latest aviation technology
look at this
it's a retractable landing gear right?
To reach 270 nautical miles per hour , this is needed
isn't is that the navy requires  220 nautical miles per hour?
That would be very soon
but it will eventually be outdated
the wing-load bearing capacity is 120,000 sq. km
its resistance to damage
will be a bold introduction to the latest technology
of course there are slats and split flaps
interesting! ,,,, nice!
However, it will be a bit heavy
but if it's not loaded with machine guns, it should be fine
this idea will be conveyed for next opportunity
it's exceptional
that's too close
our engines are incompetent
Our job is to make it light and tough
reduce as much as possible
make the surface smooth to reduce air resistance
Our airplanes will be an unprecedented all-metal airplane
may I...
come here Mr. Hirayama
Mr Hirayama from the production department technician is here with us
I'm Hirayama
He's going to talk about the new rivet
keeping the head of the rivet flat all throughout, is technically impossible
what's it about?
Flat head rivets
flat head rivets are already existing all ocer the world
so me might have to use it
that was really interesting
Miss Satomi you have a mail
thank you
Chief , phone call for you
I'll take it later
it seems to be an emergency
Hello, yes
Jiro
thank God
You don't know how much I wanted to see you.
are you well now? can you walk?
yes
Let's Go
after seeing you, I'll go home
please don't go
Stay here and live with me
such a beautiful girl
I'm Naoko
Nice to meet you Ms. Naoko
Is it Jiro?
I am to ask you a favor
my husband, isn't it good?
separate rooms is no problem, but for an unmarried couple
i won't allow it!
We will marry right away
Mr. Kurokawa Mrs. Kurokawa, please be our witness
right now?
that's stupid
dear,  dont you think it's lovely?
In order to love, it takes courage to conquer the mountain
My father knows all about this
The hospital as well was informed
please allow us
If that's the case, then let me handle things with the bride
Naoko, please come with me
don't mind my husband he is always like that
If you care about her, you should go back to the mountains as soon as possible
I can bring her back but I had to quit doing airplanes
But I can not do that
That would not be love, but your own selfish way
We don't have enough time anymore, we have to settling things
I get it.. I give you my best wishes!
they are coming
they're here
Listen.... this beautiful lady abandoned her riches
Alone on the mountains and leave to reach here....
I say.... I hope they won't regret it
May marriage not separate them till death
You're very beautiful
Mr. Kurokawa Mrs. Kurokawa we appreciate your warm thoughts
there are no words to express how much we can thank you. will never forget this
Our pleasure
you being with a wonderful person like Jiro is making us happy... right dear?
It's heroic! This calls for a celebration...Congratulations!!
did you get tired?
somehow I feel shaking in my dreams
have peace in mind.. rest well
please come here
But ...
Come
Jiro, do you always come home this late?
Kayo I totally forgot you were coming.
You are so mean..
You are now a doctor right.. Congratulations!
I have to congratulate you too
Congratulations on your wedding
I came to thank Mr. and Mrs, Kurokawa
in behalf of our parents
Where are Mr. and Mrs Kurokawa?
they are already asleep
Have you met Naoko?
yes
Do you care about Naoko?
leaving her alone and just letting her sleep
She is suffering so hard more than you think
I am a doctor so somehow I can understand her situation
Dint you even notice that she tries to give you peace of mind
and puts make-up and blush on every morning
I like Naoko very much.. she is a nice person.. I pity her
is it hard for her to go back to the hospital on the mountain?
we are spending our life to the fullest everyday
you should rest now.. thank you for paying a visit
I'm home
welcome home
just sleep
do you feel okay?
Kayo went to visit
Oh
we got along well with each other quick
she is sparkling
she is a person full of ambitions
next time, she'll take a break and will visit here as a doctor
I got a sleep-wear from your mother.. it is very warm
is it too bright?
it's fine enough
I have to do this until tomorrow
Mackerel bones?
you still remember.. we're building a family soon as husband and wife
can you come close to me
hold my hands
I love looking at your face when you're doing your work
If there is a competition using one hand, I will be the winner
it will go well I guess
maybe reduction of 50g to it's weight seems possible
that's great
it's too much
if it's for two, maybe half is okay
because it's just the skeleton, if it's a mackerel bones, the meat can be eaten
I gave you a goodnight kiss, so you should sleep now
don't let go of my hand
I won't
I want to smoke, can I let go of your hand?
No. you can smoke here
It's not good for you
It's okay
Hey Honjo
Can I look at it?
sure.. your airplane is awesome.... fair enough
it's vanguard! very daring..
so this are the flat head rivets..
it's uneven
totally Jiro's work
no influence from Junkers like mine
These is a mackerel bone.. it's awesome
Jiro please let me use the flat head rivets
also the idea of the hinge
sure
I asked for a new  bomber design but they said they will just change the fuselage
-
mostly fuel tanks,  it will catch fire in a couple of bullets
I haven't researched about bullet proof  tanks yet
having the first japan assembled airplane to fly for Navy's is a big deal
Hanging the bombs will reduce the weight, therefore it can fly above three thousand kilometers
just right timing for the power up
I wonder where will be the war and with whom
USSR, England,  Netherlands, America
there will be bombings
We are not the destructive weapon dealers
we just want to make a great airplane
you're right
see you around. get some sleep
You too Honjou
we're going ahead of you..
okay
welcome back home
It's finished. we just have to wait until test the flight
Congratulations, you worked so hard for it
It's tiring to go back and forth to work everyday
I might need to stay there for few days
you look so tired
yeah a bit
it will surely fly
it will.. it's because of you
Jiro  I love you
Naoko
I'm going now
I wish your success
Oh Naoko
Mrs. Kurokawa I feel well this morning
I want to go for a walk around
okay, don't force yourself too much
I left the room quite dirty
I'll clean after I get back
okay
Kayo is coming today.. looking forward to see her
yes,,, I'll come back very soon
come in
Oh I knew it..
She left letters
There is one for me too
She went back to the hospital in the mountain.. I will go after her
No.. don't chase her
We will see her again when she gets well
she just wanted to be with the person she loves
this is awesome
I
hey over there what have you recorded?
I'm so sorry, we have to do it again
It's too fast!
how many nautical miles?
Yeah is 240 nautical miles
it's a success! banzai!
Hey Jiro
It's a great airplane!
thank you..
you came...
Japanese boy
Mr. Caproni
Here is where we first met right?
this is the kingdom of our dreams
I thought it was hell
it's different but maybe almost the same thing
How was your 10 years? did you exert a lot of effort?
it turned into pieces in the end
Coz we destroyed the country
That is your Zero
it's spectacular.. such a good work
But no one even came back
No one is coming back
though an airplane is beautiful it is a curse dream
We are all being swallowed by this universe
There is someone waiting for you
Naoko
She has been here waiting for you
Jiro you have to live
live
i will
She's gone
she's like a beautiful wind
Thank you
thank you..
You must continue living on
don't you want to get closer? there is a good wine ahead
