This is New Country 95.5,
country from the heart...
...sending out a big welcome
to all the hopefuls...
...for the 2003 World Series of Poker.
Here 's a George Jones classic
for all you players in the game of cards...
...or the game of love.
Evening.
One-fifty.
Brand new. Never been used.
I got three of them. One-fifty.
-It cost 500.
-1 50.
-I need three.
-Sorry.
You have three digital cameras.
-AII the same.
-Pretty much.
Well, here's what
you can do with four cameras...
...that you can't do with three.
You take two of the cameras,
you price them identically.
The third camera, you price a Iittle Iess.
The fourth camera, you price a Iittle higher.
Customer comes in
wanting to buy a camera.
Figures the Ieast expensive camera's
either a bargain...
...or there's something wrong with it.
But it gets him thinking.
It gets him talking to you.
In other words,
you've got him in the game.
Odds are, he doesn't take camera number
three because he reads it as defective.
But it pushes him towards cameras
one and two...
...which he already thinks
are a good deal...
...because of the higher price
of camera number four.
Or maybe he's
drawn to camera number four.
I mean,
why is this camera more expensive?
You tell him it's never been used.
You point out that cameras one
and two have never been used...
...the only difference is,
camera number four is still in the box.
Now, he does one of two things.
He either buys one of your cameras
at the regular price...
...which he now thinks is a bargain...
...or, he springs for the one in the box...
...because he plans to give it
to someone as a present...
...and he needs the box
so it Iooks new...
...and not Iike some camera
he just picked up at a pawn shop.
You're good.
So by purchasing this camera in its box...
...you increase the value
of the three cameras you already have.
You work this hard at your day job?
Only problem is,
my cameras all have boxes.
What?
I'II tell you what.
If you can show me your boxes,
I'II give you my camera for nothing.
But, if you can't,
you pay three bills for mine.
You're pretty sure of yourself.
You don't have the boxes, do you?
I'II give you the 1 50,
plus 50 for the entertainment...
...but that's as high as I go.
Done.
What about this?
What's it worth?
To me or to you?
Well, it's worth a Iot to me.
It was my mother's.
She used to take it off...
...and then one day my dad
took off with it to get some cash.
How did you get it?
I won it off him in a poker game.
It was too Iate
to do my mom any good, though.
Sorry to hear that.
PIain band. Nothing special.
I could give you a hundred,
you'II have your three.
-He told me it was worth more than that.
-So sell it back to him.
I'm not selling it to you.
I'II be back for it.
What's your name?
Huck.
Well, Huck, I'II give you another
buck and a half for the ring...
...and you have 1 20 days
to come back and see me.
Hey, Huck.
There'II be a seat available at
table four in just a few minutes.
-Thank you.
-Eight to call.
What time can you have it here?
AII right. If that's the best you can do.
Get it here as soon as you can.
Beating up on a whale.
Some real estate guy from FIorida.
I guess you could call that a tell.
He's stuck a quarter mil and change.
I'm down
with the Iittle fish tonight, Tommy.
-Swimming with the guppies for awhile.
-Okay, kid. Good Iuck.
Three-Fifty.
Small blind. Big blind.
Sir, you wanna post?
Yeah.
-Water, Huck?
-Yeah, thanks.
I raise.
Well, Iet's raise it up, then.
-Fold.
-That's a good decision. You too.
AII very good decisions.
Especially you, water boy.
How do you Iike that river, water boy?
Sixteen is the bet.
It'II only hurt for a Iittle while.
Really.
You're betting Iike you have the eight
for the belly straight.
Or you might have caught
a third seven.
No matter how I Iook at it,
you probably got me beat.
Then again...
...maybe you don't.
It's raised to 32.
Thank you.
Screw it.
Never touch another player's cards.
Nothing. You raised me with nothing?
Sometimes nothing's enough.
-Let's Iine them up, please.
-Show cards, please.
Pair of queens.
Maverick. Jacks and queens.
Two pair is good, sir.
The winner.
Thank you.
Gentlemen. It's great to be alive, isn't it?
Raise.
Sometime today, sunshine.
You in a hurry?
PIaces to go? People to see?
Maybe.
Let's see if we can get you there
a Iittle faster, cowboy.
Raise.
Back at you.
Giddap.
Okay, it's eight, 1 0,000...
...two hundred and twenty-eight.
Do you want that in cash or chips?
Give me the ten in chips, Larita.
Robin, grab Huck's box for me, please.
-What time's your shift end?
-Not for another three hours.
My first bad beat tonight.
Get it over.
-What was that?
-Here you go. Here you go.
AII right, the over and under is three.
AII right, I got the under, who's got over?
-Hey, Huck. How you doing?
-Hey, Eddie.
Hey, three times over the net pays off,
five pays double.
-You want some of the action? Okay.
-No thanks, Eddie.
AII right, all right.
Who's got ponytail's side?
That's payday. That's payday.
Come on, you can do better than that.
Smell this, it's new.
-Smells good, right?
-Yes.
But it's not cologne
or deodorant or anything...
...it's just me.
It's just Iike my natural--
I know it's weird--
Sorry. Time got away from me.
It happens.
I know, but I keep saying
it won't happen again.
But it does.
And I'm Iate.
So you guys are...?
Yeah.
-Nice to have met you.
-Nice to have met you.
Do you always intrude
on private conversations?
Well, it seemed Iike an intrusion
might be welcome.
So you're a mind reader?
Body. Your body Ianguage indicated
a certain Iack of enthusiasm.
You might have been wrong.
-Huck.
-Billie.
-New in town?
-No.
Really?
See, you are wrong
every once in a while.
Hey, sorry I'm Iate.
That's what he just said.
Yeah, but he's a poker player, Billie,
so you can't believe anything he says.
-Busted. Suzanne.
-How you doing, Huck?
-Great, now that I've met your friend.
-My sister.
-Your sister?
-My Iittle sister.
Little sister. Even better.
Ginger. Hey.
-Hey, Huck.
-Ginger.
This is my sister, Billie.
She just got in from Bakersfield.
-This is Gary.
-Hey, you work at the....
-At the Venetian. You're the gondola guy.
-That was Iast year.
I'm a Nubian slave at The Luxor now.
-We gotta go.
-Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
-See you Saturday at the party?
-Yeah.
Hope you enjoy your visit.
Suzanne.
That was a fast withdrawal.
Yeah, well,
Huck's not one to waste any time.
Boy, you're up.
You're my sister,
there's no way I'm Ietting that happen.
Bad news?
There's quite a few
who would say it's a good time.
-Does that include you?
-No.
I had Huck's number pretty early on.
-What number is that?
-Hustle 1 0, commitment zero.
Maybe he hasn't found
what he's Iooking for.
Billie, no.
Don't even think about it.
Come on,
we've been through this before.
Some people don't wanna be fixed.
They Iike things just the way they are.
French toast. Bacon on the side.
Fruit. Strawberries only.
Hang on a second, Lucy.
Why don't you just go rest up a Iittle?
We never close.
No time Iike the present, Tommy.
Oh, I should've gotten
away from that.
-Hey, Huck.
-Hi, Huck.
-Have a seat.
-What's going on, Huck?
Fasten your seatbelts. Huck is here.
What's for breakfast?
And don't say "you are."
Eighty-six for Iow.
Eighty-seven.
-Ace wins for high.
-You win the whole pot.
Nice deck.
-Look who's here.
-Good morning, gentlemen.
-Well, he's back.
-Hey, good to see you.
-What's going on?
-Good to see you.
Big Buckle, good to see you.
Sammy, Chau.
-Good to see you.
-Michelle, my belle.
Oh, I've missed you, L.C.
You in town for the tournament?
Yeah, well, someone's gotta try
and stem the tide of those couch potatoes.
-Is there an empty seat?
-Right here between me and Chau.
Twenty thousand.
Couldn't go another World Series
without you, L.C.
So how was the south of France?
French.
They hate our politics,
but they Iove our games...
...I'm happy to say.
Yeah, Iooks Iike the kid
has got the jump on everybody.
He's really hot.
-What's new and different, kid?
-Your hair, for one thing.
Kid tries to bring out the worst in people.
As I get on in years, Iike all human beings,
I become acquainted with vanity.
How about you? Still blasting away?
Thousand to go.
Re-raise.
Nice to play with you again, kid.
What do you say, fellas?
Not a spectator sport.
Five thousand.
How deep are you?
Oh, I've got about eighteen thousand.
Okay.
I'm putting you all-in.
Well, I'm gonna have to call you, L.C...
...because my pretty Iadies
are just dying to step out.
Well, they'II be in good company.
Three Kings.
You son of a bitch.
You're the only man
I enjoy Iosing money to.
Loan me twenty, L.C.?
Is there anybody who doesn't owe you?
Just you, kid. Just you.
Raise you 60.
Eight thousand.
It's an interesting situation.
I had you sitting
with a medium pocket pair.
Nines wired, perhaps,
which would give you a set.
You had me figured for a straight draw.
Now, the question is:
Am I four to a flush, too?
With a pot this size,
I'II call you no matter what you raise.
The prudent thing would be
to just call, protect your chips...
...so you can play again, another day.
No, Prudence, the question is...
...you talking because you got
the diamonds, or because you don't?
You and I both know
what the book says you should do, kid.
Is that what you do now?
Just play by the book?
You might as well play online.
Raise.
I'm all-in.
You sure?
Now, you can pull it back if you want.
I'd bet more if I had it.
-You would?
-Yeah.
I'II Iet you throw in
that charm of yours...
...that wedding ring
you're fond of carrying.
AIthough, I notice
you don't have it with you.
You're right, I don't.
But I'II put up the pawn ticket
that redeems it...
...against that wristwatch
you're wearing.
Yeah?
Okay. May I?
Get out of here.
A buck and a half?
You must have been up against it, kid.
I know that ring's worth a Iot more
than that to you.
And my watch is worth a Iot more
than that to me.
My father's 1 938 Bulova.
He wore it through the war,
but I'II take that bet.
Anybody mind?
Are you kidding? Come on.
This is between you two.
But we're happy to watch.
So insane.
I got you covered.
Possible flush...
...open-ended straight draw.
How are you fixed?
Pocket nines.
Imagine that.
Let's see the river.
Diamond flush, the winner.
That hurts.
Too bad, Huckleberry.
Sometimes it pays to be prudent.
Hey, Huck,
you know what your problem is?
You.
You're a great player.
You know the math.
You read your opponents
as well as anybody I've ever seen.
The trouble is you're a blaster.
You always have been.
Thanks for the analysis.
Listen, go for broke,
you're gonna wind up broke.
He drew Iucky.
I caught a case of second best.
You want sympathy...
...you'II find it between
shit and syphilis in the dictionary.
If you don't Ieave
your volatility at home...
-...you'II never be in the same Ieague--
-What do you want?
I want you to play with my money.
It'II even you out.
It'II make you a better player.
Your money's not involved,
your emotions will be Iess involved.
I'II stake you the ten grand buy-in
to the World Series, we split the winnings.
Let me ask you something,
how much do you weigh?
Oh, 1 50, give or take a Iittle.
How much you think I weigh?
-One-eighty-five.
-One-eighty-five.
Now you tell me,
how well do you think I'm gonna play...
...with an additional 1 50 pounds
on my back?
Give or take a Iittle.
That is an arbitration clause,
but it may not be binding here.
We may be in Iuck. Why don't
you read me paragraph two again...
...one more time from the top.
-Hope this isn't about money.
-You got any money?
It's good to see you, Huckster.
-1 -900-Mental.
-Is this a real psychologist?
Yes, all of our psychologists
are board certified and accredited.
-That's a relief, because--
-One moment, please.
Okay.
-1 -900-Defend. PIease hold.
-I have a--
Yes. This is Dr. Shuman.
May I ask your name?
Yeah, Toby.
What seems to be the problem?
-It's my girlfriend.
-Come on, Jack.
Turn into 1 -900-Loan, spot me a thousand
to get me going again.
What did I just tell you?
-Dr. Shuman, are you there?
-Sorry, Toby, yes.
-When I drive by, she's out.
-What do you think she's telling you...
-...with this chronic behavior?
-I don 't know.
I'm wondering if I shouldn't put you
on with our relationship...
...and commitment therapist,
Dr. Gregory.
-Okay.
-Keep him talking.
-You're playing a Iosing hand.
-Really, you think so?
This is a case of throwing
good money after bad.
-You should just get out, Toby.
-Thanks, doctor.
Hold on one moment. Our contract
specialist will be with you presently.
-What are you doing?
-What?
Rule number one, be a Iistener. Listen.
-I can't help you. I want to, but I can't.
-Jack, come on, you know I'm good for it.
Why does everyone
try to take advantage of me?
Cheryl, I am hearing you
express your pain...
...and I'm feeling empathy.
You understand, don 't you, doctor?
Yes. From my own experience,
I know how disheartening it is...
...to feel that you're being
taken advantage of by friends.
-All they do is take from me.
-Exactly, Cheryl.
When the motives become monetary,
it's parasitic.
It is parasitic.
Julie split and took the kids.
I think she means it this time.
-She always means it.
-No, I'm telling you.
She does not even wanna talk
about talking about it.
You might need to dial 1 -900-It's-Over.
Thanks.
I don't even go to restaurants.
-You okay?
-I don 't have anybody to talk to.
No.
Don't you ever get Ionely?
I don 't know what
I'm gonna do with myself.
I feel as though I'm stuck here
waiting for my life to start.
-If I could just hit a button....
-With friends Iike you? Never.
-Still not getting nickel one.
-Damn.
That's not fair to you, Cheryl.
Are you gonna accept that?
You Iocked out?
Either that,
or I just enjoy sitting on staircases.
How Iong before Suzanne will be back?
I don't know.
-She was gonna Ioan me some money.
-Oh, yeah?
Well, I've got...
...$1 9, is that enough?
That's all you brought with you?
And a thousand dollars
in traveler's checks.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes. This is she.
Yes. Hello.
Tonight? Yes.
AII right. Thank you very much.
I got a job. Singing at Dean's.
-Dino's?
-You know the place?
Sure.
It's my first job singing professionally.
Oh, we should celebrate.
This is an occasion.
You're right. It is.
Well, Iet's go.
Good Iuck to you.
Thank you.
Discipline's the key.
We have serious celebrating to do...
...so we only play
until we double our money.
-Do you know how to play poker?
-I know that three of a kind beats two pair.
Very good.
Binion's Horseshoe Casino
in downtown Las Vegas...
...proud home
of the World Series of Poker.
The 2003 Omaha event will commence
in two hours in Benny's Bullpen.
BIinds, please.
Okay. In T exas Hold ' Em...
...each player gets two cards
that no one else sees.
Then five cards are dealt
face up on the table.
Now, these are cards
that everybody can use.
If you think you have
the best two cards...
...or two cards
you'd Iike to draw to, you bet.
And, if you don't, you fold.
Raise.
Call.
Four players.
-Check.
-Check.
If, for instance,
someone had a king in the hole...
...they'd now have two pair.
kings and fours.
One more heart and you've got a flush.
That's right. Of course, the trick
is to not Iet the other players know...
-...when you got something good.
-Okay.
Hence the expression, "poker face."
Three players.
-Check.
-Check it.
Forty.
Raise it to 80.
I call.
Call 80.
-Check.
-Check it.
Check it.
-What are you doing?
-Forty.
I'II raise.
Raise it to 80.
I give her a king and a queen in the hole
for an ace-high straight.
-Yeah?
-Fold.
I call.
I've got Broderick Crawford.
Tens and fours. Two pair.
A straight.
Ace-high straight. The winner.
Nice hand.
Over and out.
How did you know?
It was the way she bet before the flop,
and the way she bet after the flop.
A good fold is as important as a win.
Sometimes more important.
Pair of kings. Kings are the winner.
This is fun.
-BIinds, please.
-Hey, Huck. How they falling?
Lester. Billie Offer.
Nice to meet you.
Ready Eddie bet me 20 Iarge I couldn't
Iive in the AIaddin bathroom a month.
-You gonna take him up on it?
-I'm thinking about it.
Want a piece of my action if I do?
How hard can it be?
Maybe I can even get him to give us odds.
I'm kind of financially handicapped
right now.
So, Billie...
...a hundred bucks
says I can make it...
...to the end of the room
without touching the ground.
-Bet.
-Bet.
Fold.
Call 40. 20 to call.
Three players.
-Send the hundred over.
-You still owe me $1 000...
...from miniature golf, remember?
Shovel against a rake?
Then put it on my account.
Did that man have breasts,
or is he physically challenged?
Well, someone bet him 50 grand
he wouldn't get breast implants...
...and keep them for six months.
Guy named Zembic did it 1 2 months
a couple years ago...
...said the women went wild
for the breasts, so Lester took the bet.
Raise. PIay for 80.
Well, he should wear
a more flattering blouse.
Hey, Huck. Can I get you anything?
No thanks, Sherry.
You must play a Iot.
You know so many people.
Well, this is what I do.
What, Iike a job?
You don't work, you just gamble?
Well, who said it's not work?
It's the work this city's all about.
I'm all-in.
Raise. AII-in. PIaying for 35.
Call.
Why'd you turn your cards over?
Well, he's out of chips,
so there's no more betting.
Two players.
Pair of queens.
Unless he gets another nine,
we've got him.
Come on, nine.
-Come on, nine.
-Come on, nine.
-Yes!
-Yes!
Three nines the winner.
-Thank you.
-Well, you beat him once.
-It doesn't work Iike that.
-Well, maybe it should.
L.C. Great to see you.
How you doing?
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.
BIinds, please.
-Hello, Huck.
-Hey.
Hey. You remember Isabel.
-Beautiful as ever.
-Thank you.
-I hear that your Ieft pocket is empty.
-Really?
-How you hitting them?
-Down the middle.
Yeah, we should tee it up.
It's been a Iong time.
I went and got this out of hock.
It's nice to have it back.
I have a feeling it's gonna bring me Iuck.
-I'm L.C.
-Hi, I'm Billie Offer. Nice to meet you.
-Thank you very much.
-Is he related to you?
-Why do you say that?
-Because your eyes went all quiet.
BIinds, please.
In poker, we call that a tell.
He's my father.
Dr. Laura says, " If you Iive your Iife
angry at your parents...
...you're only hurting yourself."
Well, who said I was angry at anybody?
-Raise.
-Call.
-You know what, I should get going.
-Five players.
I don't wanna be Iate
my first night of work.
-Anybody mind? I owe the Iady 1 000.
-Nobody cares.
Your stake, plus a 20 percent return.
-You don't have to.
-Fair is fair.
Do you mind cashing it in yourself?
I've got the best of it right now.
I really shouldn't Ieave the table.
And I'm sorry we didn't get around
to the celebrating.
No, don't be. I haven't had
this much fun since junior high.
Thanks, sugar.
Raise.
-Raise.
-Re-raise.
-What are you watching?
-Australian games. Not bad.
Helps with March Madness withdrawal.
-Got any money?
-I don't Ioan to gamblers.
-I gotta get up the 1 0 for the World Series.
-Save your money. That's a sucker bet.
Against a thousand computer geeks.
Hey, foul! He's fouling him. That's a foul.
How about advancing your rent?
I'm paid up
through the NCAA Finals 2008.
-You wanna buy the house?
-You grew up in this house.
PIus, the bank already owns it.
AII right. Just dribble out the clock.
Come on.
Okay. Pick it up. Get it back.
Get it back. Get it back.
I'm heading back East tonight.
Hey, you haven't seen
my digital camera, have you?
-I was so nervous.
-Didn't show.
I didn't expect to see you so soon.
You're not trying to rustle me, are you?
What about that celebration?
-It's kind of Iate, isn't it?
-This is Las Vegas.
I don't know.
-Can it be Chinese?
-Let's go.
Thanks.
-Can I get you something to drink, sir?
-Billie?
Do you mind if I get my fortune cookie first?
I Iike to think about it during the meal.
Could you bring her a fortune cookie
before we order?
What about you?
Don't you wanna read your fortune?
I can't afford to be superstitious.
-Don't you believe in Iuck?
-I believe in skill.
AIthough, it did seem the cards ran
a Iittle better for me when you were around.
-What happened to "the best of it"?
-Turned into a Iittle bit of the worst of it.
Maybe after dinner,
we'II go play some pok--
Hey. Billie Offer, Chico Banh.
-My pleasure.
-Hello.
-You get a seat yet?
-I'm working on it.
-He doesn't Iook Mexican.
-Vietnamese.
Grew up in Texas. Speaks Spanish
better than he does English.
PIays tournament poker
better than anybody.
Really?
What? What's it say?
" Big contest is yours to win
and riches too."
Let me see that.
" He who thinks too much
is thinking too much."
Got you,
Mr. I-Can't-Afford-To-Be-Superstitious.
Okay.
When someone says "Ieft pocket,"
what does that mean?
-It's where you keep your important money.
-Like the money to enter the tournament.
And the winner of the World Series
is the best there is?
Tournaments are for the public.
You know, the perception of who's best.
To determine who's best,
you'd play head-to-head...
...no Iimit, with your own money.
Then why do you wanna play in it?
Did your father win it?
Twice.
Was he always a gambler?
He was an English professor
when he married my mother.
She stuck by him until he Ieft her,
after he stole everything he could.
The Ieaf doesn't fall far from the tree.
You hate him, but you still play poker.
He taught me to play. Pennies, nickels,
and dimes on the kitchen table.
I could never beat him
and he never Iet me win.
Mama was a piano teacher...
...and she taught her students
Brahms and Chopin...
...but her real Iove was Nashville.
We used to sing together,
all around the house and in the car.
And I always wanted to try it for real.
So your mother must be proud of you.
She died Iast October.
But tonight,
I almost felt Iike she was Iistening.
You know what I think?
I think everybody's just trying
not to be Ionely.
-You cold?
-A Iittle.
Thank you.
-Where's all the furniture?
-I'm redecorating.
Come on. Let me show you
what I've done with the rest of the place.
-AII-in.
-How much you got?
Twelve thousand two hundred.
-Coffee?
-Yes.
You've been running over everybody
all morning.
Don't chase what you can't catch.
No matter what's prudent,
sometimes you gotta play your gut.
I think I got him.
-I think he knows it too.
-Don't Iet your ego get involved.
If you're so sure, want a side bet?
-Yeah.
-The ring?
Against 500.
The price of poker's gone up.
-You're on.
-Which one of you am I playing?
Or is this a team?
Call. Stuck on deuces.
Deuces?
AII you got is deuces?
And you call me with this shit?
Deuces the winner.
That was a great call.
-Thanks, Robin.
-Thanks, Huck.
-How did you do?
-Not bad.
Where you going, Huck?
That real estate guy just walked in.
We're starting the big game.
-You stole from me.
-Borrowed. I-- I had it way up.
Borrowing is when you ask!
-You'II get it back, I promise.
-I worked hard. I needed it.
I've got responsibilities and bills.
I'm trying to get a place on my own.
If I'd have won, you'd have a share.
Just Iike before.
You think that the only person
that matters is you.
What you need, when you need it!
-You're a sick pony.
-Puppy.
Billie? Look, it was wrong,
but I'm gonna pay you back.
I'm not a bank! You can't make deposits
and withdrawals whenever you feel Iike it.
-Wait. Just Iet me--
-Don't say it.
You say whatever you think
somebody wants to hear.
It's dangerous to be around you.
That's why you came
to the club, isn't it?
You knew I had the money.
Decided why not get some put-out
at the same time?
-It wasn't Iike that.
-Here. You missed some.
We're a couple minutes away
from the Super Satellite.
Winner gets the $ 1 0,000 seat
at the No Limit Texas Hold 'Em event.
-Hey, Bill.
-The Super Satellite?
-How many entries you have?
-Well, Iet' s see.
SIug your way through 44 wannabes,
and you got your seat in the big one.
Two and a quarter if you wanna try it.
-I call.
-And then there were three.
Mr. Ray Zumbro, Mr. Huck Cheever...
...and the current chip Ieader,
Ms. Shannon Kincaid.
Cheever? L.C. Cheever's son?
And you play cards?
That takes balls.
Heads up.
I'm all-in.
Call.
Two pair. Kings and deuces.
Kings and eights the winner.
She did play well.
Must be tough
playing in the shadow of your father.
Little coffeehousing for distraction?
No, you wouldn't be bothered
by anything Iike that. I mean...
...you wouldn't have gotten this far
if you couldn't stand on your own two feet.
I'm all-in.
You're not trying
to steal the blinds, are you?
How much does he have?
Jesus, old man,
when you gonna Iearn to count, huh?
It's 20 a stack. See? 20 a stack.
Fifty-one hundred, sir.
Call.
Pair of eights.
Tens to eights.
Tens to eights still stand.
Pair of tens are still tall. Last card--
The tens stand up. Mr. Cheever wins
a seat in the World Series.
Sorry I won't be seeing you
at the big dance.
Hey, wait a minute,
there's only two burn cards.
What?
Mr. Cheever. Mr. Cheever.
-I'm afraid we've had a misdeal.
-What do you mean you've had a misdeal?
No card was burned, the dealer neglected
to burn a card before the river.
That's not my problem.
A card Iaid's a card played.
I'm sorry, but house rules require a card
to be burned before any cards are turned.
And in the event of this situation the card
is put back, it's used as a burn card...
...and then a new river is dealt.
Take back the six.
Burn it.
Deal the river.
-Yeah! Yeah, baby!
-A set. Three eights the winner.
Guess you won't be needing
to press your dress quite yet, Cinderella.
I heard about the misdeal.
Boy, talk about a bad beat, huh?
Okay, so you put up the 1 0,
we split anything I win fifty-fifty.
-Seventy-thirty.
-What happened to sixty-forty?
Went away when your tens
went down to a set of eights.
Okay. Sixty-five-thirty-five.
Fine, seventy-thirty.
I need an extra 1 200.
It's that or no deal.
-You took the bet.
-It's Iike stealing money.
Look at him. Checking up on me.
He's still hoping I'm gonna sneak out.
He's having a party now,
three days into it.
In a week, you'II be begging to get
out of here. You play any golf Iately?
-A Iittle.
-"A Iittle."
-Four handicap and he says "a Iittle."
-Six from the black tees.
I'II tell you what. I'II bet you 5000
that you can't run five miles...
...shoot 1 8 holes of golf, 78 or under,
in three hours or Iess.
-Forget it.
-Room service.
Oh, yeah. Put it right here, boss.
Paulie's right outside that door, just in case
you're thinking of trying anything.
Think about that bet, Huck.
Comfort food.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I'm truly sorry, Billie.
I want you to give me another chance.
Why should I?
You know what you said before
about everybody trying not to be Ionely?
I feel Iike we have a chance
at something special here.
And if you cut it off now,
we'II never know.
Why don't you just come have breakfast
with me, see how it goes?
Thanks.
-Don't you ever sleep?
-I don't need much sleep.
So you play poker instead.
Why do you Iike it so much?
Is it the money?
The money's just a way of keeping score.
Poker is competition in the purest sense.
Doesn't matter who you are,
or what you are...
...everybody's equal at the table.
But you can't have sympathy and win.
In order for you to win,
someone else has to Iose.
It seems so cruel.
So you just gamble all the time?
I never bet on sports,
never play against the house...
...and I only bet on my skills
against the skills of other people.
That sounds Iike an alcoholic saying,
"I only drink tequila."
What about Festus,
or whatever his name is...
...jumping across the floor?
You bet on that.
The chair thing's an old gag,
and I did it for you...
...because I thought
you'd think it was funny.
-Miss Offer.
-Mr. Cheever.
I thought you might be here.
