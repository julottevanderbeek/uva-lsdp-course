I never even been with a chick before.
- Neither have I!
- So... you think you're skeeved?
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's happening again.
It's not just a paint job.
You'd need a real carpenter, contractor.
I can do all that shit.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
I'd sully-rig it.
What's sully-rig it?
Eh, sort of a temporary permanent.
"Gay, lesbian, bi,
transgender association."
- You ought to put a letter in for people like me.
- Excuse me?
Maybe it's not a good idea
to purposely leave anyone out.
Thank you.
Will you marry me?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Hey, did you tell my
buddy your good news yet?
Why would Neil care?
Can I please stay here until the wedding?
Live here?
Yeah.
This reeks.
Yeah, till one day you land
your first really big fish.
This is my big fish... Lynda P. Frazier.
Who is that?
Princess Valhalla Hawkwind.
I thought that you were her.
Well, I'll always be her.
I just met the most
amazing woman in the world.
I thought I was the most
amazing woman in the world.
I got my mind literally blown.
If you literally had your mind
blown, your brain would be gone.
Who are you?
Marshall's lady friend.
Marshall's friend.
What the fuck
you do with my biker boots?
What do you want?!
I need the body!
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby.
open up the sky
this mess is getting high
* it's windy, and our
family needs a ride *
I know we'll be just fine
when we learn to love the ride
I know we'll be fine
when we learn to love the ride
I know we'll be just fine
when we learn to love the ride
I'm fucked.
I just woke up... again...
naked... again...
next to that woman from the grocery store
who has two kids and a lazy boy.
I don't know what Buck's
been doing over there,
but it can't be good.
It's been two weeks since
Buck's been taking the body.
"I just want it for a few hours," he said.
Yeah, a few hours a day.
Fish sticks! Fish sticks!
you don't come here too often
Hey! I want that one.
* you make my
day when you come around *
I don't understand why
this is happening now.
I mean... everything at home is great.
The kids are thriving.
Max has never been happier.
And he keeps saying I'm
the best I've ever been.
Little does he know that,
for the first time ever,
I am a liar.
I mean, my alters have lied
before, but me... Tara...
I never have.
I just can't bring myself to
tell him I'm transitioning again.
It'll break his heart.
wish I had not said that, baby
I'd like to get a refill on my depakote.
Mm-hmm.
No, I'm good on the risperdal.
'Cause I wouldn't want it to run out.
You need all that just
to get through the day?
Someone's a mess.
Okay, great. I'll pick it
up this afternoon. Thanks.
That was the pharmacy.
I gathered.
Wow. You look downright...
Doable.
She looks doable, dad.
Oh, it's all right. I'm used to it.
It's the burden of kids
born to teenage mothers.
I should start a group called "adult
children of moms you'd like to fuck."
Max: Kate. Sir.
The Hubbard house is officially ours.
Ha ha! Escrow just closed.
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
I'm gonna call this contractor
and get him to meet me over...
hey, when I'm done with this house
and I flip it and we make a little profit,
I'm taking you to Hawaii,
'cause my honey loves the sea.
Well, my friends, I would love to stay,
but I have debts to whisper.
Oh, and by the by, it's official.
Marshall and Courtney... game on.
Courtney... that girl
that was here at dinner?
Marshall's dating a girl?
Well, I guess that makes sense...
on opposite day.
I bet she's fantasizing
he's Edward Cullen.
You have something against
wildly popular vampire novels?
It's so objectifying, like
virginity is this prized possession.
Such a sophomoric view of sex.
I...Think they are sophomores.
How often do you think about sex?
Me?
I think about it all the time.
Aren't you sort of dying of curiosity?
I am.
I guess.
There's a million things I'm
completely clueless about.
For example, do you know how
to do "dogs in a bathtub"?
What are... what are "dogs in a bathtub"?
Exactly.
So, Marshall says he's straight now?
Mm, I think he's confused.
Who isn't, sister?
I'm not.
I'm marrying Nick, and I'm ecstatic.
I had a girlfriend
when I was Marshall's age.
Wow. You dated women?
It was the '70s, honey.
Girlfriends, boyfriends...
if it could dance, I'd do it.
Charmaine: I was a "lug"...
a lesbian until graduation.
But it was only for one semester.
You never told me about any women.
Her name was Gretchen, and she
was very proud of her vagina.
What? Ugh.
Why did God call it a vagina?
Why didn't he call it
something cute and French?
Like what... "crouton"?
I do love croutons.
I always wondered what
makes straight women go gay.
Oh, that's easy... menopause.
Oprah did a whole show on it.
I mean, I'm gonna go gay when I'm
ready to start eating carbs again.
All I know is, it took me years to
figure out what I really wanted...
men, women, et ceteras.
I had to do a full investigation.
You have to touch it, live
it, taste it to know it.
You got to get up in it.
Well... Hello, Pammy.
Why, hello.
Good afternoon.
Good aftern... good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Ohh.
Good aftnoon, Pammy.
Ugh.
Man, this is the third time Sully's late.
How much money did you
give him for materials?
Mm, 300 bucks... not that much.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
You know what? I think
you have been sully-rigged.
He'll show up.
See, what you don't get, Neil,
is people can have a hard time,
then, out of nowhere, they turn it around.
People change.
Yeah, yeah, people change, and
then they change right back.
It's been months since Tara
got out of the hospital.
I mean, sure, I worry,
but the fact is, she's
healthier than ever.
Got this house we're gonna flip.
Hell, Marshall's even dating a girl.
People surprise you.
You... you think, like, maybe
Charmaine could, you know,
come around or come back
around to a freak like me?
You want my opinion?
Maybe Charmaine's not good enough for you.
Maybe there's some terrific women
on eharmony.com right now...
women who can't wait to
be with a freak like you.
I don't want a terrific woman, man.
I want Charmaine.
Hey.
Your check bounced.
Is that your ride?
Sort of.
My neighbor blew his brains
out, so now I'm driving it.
You owe me money.
Okay.
Hey.
What up?
Hey, Ricky.
Taking a break from your busy schedule
raising the median income around here?
I'm Ricky.
Ricky's a trustafarian.
Cool.
What's a trustafarian?
Trust-fund baby who only says hello to me
when there's a pretty blond girl around.
So, what's up?
You guys feel like partying?
Hi, Pammy.
Why, you look pretty.
You look... you look pretty.
You do.
Ooh!
I'm gonna give you a check
from my personal account this time.
I can't believe you're a debt collector.
Why would you want to work for the man?
Probably 'cause she's
not living off of him.
Hey, I'm off the grid, babe...
no bank accounts, no electricity.
No, just daddy's money.
Shit is fucking hilarious, Lynda.
I mean, it's awesome,
but it's, uh, hilarious.
Here. It's good. I promise.
Thanks.
So, tell me something.
Do you feel better now?
You have your piece of
paper with the numbers on it,
promising that more numbers
are gonna be transferred
between a couple of fucking accounts,
which is basically just
more numbers, anyway?
Leave the girl alone.
Some of us have to work.
Now, where's this party
you keep promising?
You see, her eyes are open.
Young woman: Ay, but their sense is shut.
What is it she does now?
No. Stop, stop, stop, Alex.
Alex, you're playing a doctor...
From the olden days, not
a slutty dental hygienist.
Places.
How am I doing?
Uh... g... great.
Um, you're very skilled... really.
Am I?
Thank you.
That's really a relief.
You never know if you
have a talent for something
until you actually do it.
Okay, my turn. You try me now.
Oh, uh, all right.
Um...
Okay, uh... uh, let's see.
Am... am I getting warm?
Close.
Here... give me your hand.
Young woman: Yet, here's a spot.
That feels excellent, Marshall.
Out, damned spot. One, two.
Why, then, 'tis time to do it.
Hell is murky.
Cut! What is that sound?
House lights.
Hey.
Okay, I swear we're psychic friends.
I was just thinking about you.
Oh. Oh.
Let me get you a beer. Take a load off.
You don't even have to fight the
kids today for your favorite chair.
They're with their daddy.
That's my spot, silly.
Oh, I get it.
You want to try out mama bear's
chair 'cause it's so soft?
All right, daddy.
Here's your beer, honey.
Thanks. Thanks, hon.
Are you okay?
'Cause you know I like
it when you're happy.
We went to Funworld?
Yeah, we did.
That was a fun day, huh?
And a fun night.
Oh, man. I, uh, I got
a headache coming on.
It's like a gang of elves in there
with, uh... jackhammers.
Let me work on it, baby.
Pammy's got just what you need.
Uh... I can't do this.
I can't... I can't do this. I'm sorry.
When she's on medication or
whatever, she's like this new person.
Yeah? Well, good for her.
You know, the other day,
I walked in on them moaning and groaning
over some paint chips.
Man, that weed was fantastic.
The only thing
about Ricky's trustafarian weed
is it makes me crave shit like pasta
marinara with prosciutto and bananas.
You know,
it's actually pretty good.
I mean, maybe the tomato's
stepping on the banana a little bit.
What's all that stuff?
Oh, after you stopped by,
I thought about all my
princess Valhalla Hawkwind shit.
Want to see it?
Yes.
Ooh.
Oh, these boots are badass!
Whoo.
Oh! Oh!
Comic book.
PVH escapes her evil dad in
order to rescue her sister.
Yeah, I know
about this. I saw it online.
All while wearing small, red boy shorts.
And flying with pink wings.
Ridiculous.
And rad.
You know...
You really do look like her.
Bullshit.
You just think all
white people look alike.
Well...
You know... at the risk of
getting distracted from the capital
that I'm here to survey
and then retrieve...
I'm gonna be right back.
I can't believe this. I
can't fucking believe this!
I don't think you understand.
Um...
I have a disorder.
Oh, yeah, right.
Sex addicts, tweakers,
alcoholics, oxy-morons...
it's always the disease's fault, isn't it?
Never someone just being an asshole!
I'm not... I'm not
trying to be an asshole.
I'm...
Have you seen "Sybil"?
Yeah.
It's like that.
You're lying to me!
I'm not lying.
Buck is a personality...
a fake personality.
And he... he takes me over,
and I can't control what he does.
You're
the fake personality.
No, I'm... I'm Tara.
I... I'm the...
And you better watch your ass.
You better watch your ass,
because I'm gonna tell Buck
you came over here and you did this to me,
and he will fuck you up for hurting me.
He promised he'd never let anyone hurt me.
Aww, I don't want to hurt you, Pammy.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I fucking never get the guy.
Kate: You ready for this?
Princess Valhalla Hawkwind.
Damn, girl. You're a superstar.
Whoo.
Whoo.
Hmm.
Sully's phone number's disconnected.
He ripped you off.
Hey, relax, okay?
Recording says it's temporary.
There's a recession going
on, in case you haven't heard.
Mnh! Denial!
No, I just...
I don't sweat the small
stuff anymore, okay?
Life's too short... and,
these days, too good.
Max, I need your opinion.
My ring is loose.
Now, should I wait and tell Nick,
Or can I just
get it resized myself?
Hey, Neil.
Is that an engagement ring?
Um...
Yeah, it is.
May I see it?
Oh.
It's very pretty.
Yeah, it's, um... I guess it's...
it's the... the clarity is a vs2, and...
yeah, I'll see you around, Charmaine.
The color number isn't
really all that high.
So, you know, I guess it
could be a lot prettier.
He knows I'm with Nick now.
You should have told him weeks
ago you were getting married.
He probably feels like you lied to him.
He'll be all right.
So...Should I take the
ring back myself or not?
This shit is biblical.
Here. I'll smoke you out.
Mm... I'm not into weed.
It makes me like action movies.
Well, you're not into girls,
but you're not letting that stop you.
How is your beard,
anyway? You guys boning?
Way to go, trick. Hmm.
Give me that.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
I only get 5%.
Or I might just rip it up.
Why?
Because I like my new friends
more than I like numbers
on a piece of paper.
But if you don't turn it
in, won't you get in trouble?
Dude, take another hit.
Heterosexuality is stressing you out.
Can I ask you something?
Uh, what does "dogs in a bathtub" mean?
I waited for fucking three hours,
and Sully blew me off again.
You know, honey, we need to have more fun.
I feel like the most
entertaining thing we do
is dole out these.
What? We have fun.
Yeah, we renovate the house next door,
we medicate me, and
say "I love you" a lot.
'Cause I love you.
I'm serious! Let's do something!
Bowling.
I fucking hate bowling!
Oh.
You know what would be fun?
Jazzercise?
No!
Ice skating. Remember?
Ah.
Feel a chill in the air...
The Zamboni machine.
Open skate!
Hi. How high are you?
I'm fine, ma'am. How high are you?
Tara: Come on out, you two.
We're going on an adventure.
Aah! And bring your mittens.
Adventure! Ooh!
W-where?
whatcha gon' do?
you wanna get down?
tell me, whatcha gon' do?
do you wanna get down?
whatcha gon' do?
you wanna get down?
whatcha gon' do?
you wanna get down?
tell me
get down on it
get down on it
get down on it
get down on it
come on and
get down on it
get down on it
get down on it
get down on it
* how you gonna do it if you
really don't want to dance? *
by standing on the wall
get your back up off the wall
tell me
* how you gonna do it if you
really don't want to dance? *
by standing on the wall
get your back up off the wall
'cause I heard all the people sayin'
hello?
Can you turn that down?
Can
I get your attention, please?
I didn't want to do this...
But, you know, you only go
around one time in this life,
and sometimes it's speak
now or hold your piece.
So I'm gonna speak now,
because I've been holding it all my life.
Buck, I love you.
I love you.
I was up all night thinking
about you and about us.
And, finally, I just said "fuck it."
These past few weeks have
been the best ones of my life.
I just... I love you
for who you really are...
Buck, Tara, all of you.
And, you know, I'm...
I'm not afraid of
whatever disease you got.
I hope I catch it.
Buck...
You made me want to
have to... get the guy.
Um...
Uh, you can go back to your skating,
or counterclockwise, or... as you were.
Woman: Nice speech!
All I've ever done is be good to you.
That's all I've ever
done... just be good to you.
here am I, and I'm feelin' fine
sittin' up on my cloud nine
I left my troubles behind
looks like the sun's gonna shine
Hot dog. Everything's going normal.
I guess we really shouldn't be surprised.
Come on, you guys.
Look on the bright side.
Okay.
Don't.
Now, to answer your question,
the dogs are your balls,
and the bathtub is...
sittin' up here on my cloud nine
Sully.
Sully!
Give me my money back. That's all I want.
Pal.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Relax, will you?
It's my kid's birthday.
Hey, come on, come on.
Don't get your panties in
a bunch, Maxie. All right?
Hey, say hi to Tara.
looks like the sun's
Asswipe.
gonna shine
nothin' but your love is on my mind
sittin' up here on my cloud nine
* come home to me, babe,
you'll feel so fine *
lovin' is good on cloud nine
