RARBG.COM Max: They say there's power
in Boston.
Some phone service in Denver.
But things are far
from what they were.
Maybe it was all inevitable.
An unavoidable collision between
mankind and technology.
The Internet was meant to make
the world a smaller place.
But it actually feels smaller
without it.
I knew will and Evelyn caster
better than anyone.
I knew their brilliance.
Their dedication
to what they believed in.
And to what they loved.

I'm not sure
what the point is.
Copper shields the
electromagnetic radiation.
Yeah, I know how it works.
I'm asking...
"Why?"
Sanctuary.
Nothing gets through.
No signals of any kind.
You see? Dead zone.
Nothing.
Uh-huh, sure, but you could
just turn it off.
Yeah, but fewer distractions
is what you wanted, right?
Isn't it?
Yeah.
That's what I wanted.
Come on, we'll be late.
For what?
Hey, you know what?
What?
I really think I'm starting
to make progress on this.
Hey!
You need to get dressed.
I don't know why you bother
with these proofs.
Yeah, only three people
in the world even care.
Because it's fun.
You sure you're up
for this?
No. Not remotely.
Really?
Will, it's important.
I know,
but your donors are fools.
They just sit there
in a daze
waiting for me to say the words
"commercial application."
It kills me.
Well,
the "fools" there today
could fund us
for the next 5 years.
Well, then I suppose
in that case
I have every reason
to behave.
Yes.
But if this goes well,
please, you have to
promise me that I'll,
I'll never have to do this
ever again.
Never. Promise.
Okay. I promise.
Really?
Sure.
I promise.
You're lying.
All: Happy Birthday,
dear Aaron!
Happy Birthday to you!
Man: Jason,
other side of the stage.
Yeah, I'd like to do
a camera check
and a sound check together.
You'll do the first block,
followed by mcrae,
llewellyn, and --
ah, then the main event.
Evelyn: Max.
Ev, how are you?
Good.
Ready to sing
for your supper?
I'm sorry to put you
through it.
Doctor caster?
Sorry. Would you mind?
Sure thing.
Thanks.
What?
You have groupies?
Why don't I get groupies?
Excuse me. Doctor waters, would
you like to do a run through?
Yes, please.
I'll see you backstage.
Alright.
Doctor Casey:
The effort to develop a strong
artificial intelligence
has led to significant
advancements
in the field
of neural engineering,
as well as our understanding
of the human brain.
But while some focus
on the still-distant dream
of a thinking computer,
I believe the journey
to be more important
than the destination.
My priority is to use
my colleagues'
accidental insights
to develop new methods for
the early detection of cancer.
And in the hopes of finding
a cure for Alzheimer's.
Simply put, to save lives.
Evelyn: "A new type of thinking
is essential,
if mankind is to survive
and move toward higher levels."
Albert Einstein said that
more than 50 years ago.
And it couldn't be more relevant
than it is today.
Intelligent machines
will soon allow us
to conquer our most
intractable challenges.
Not merely to cure disease,
but to end poverty and hunger.
To heal the planet.
And build a better future
for all of us.
I don't know anybody
who is doing more
to make that future a reality
than our next speaker.
But then again,
I'm probably biased.
Please welcome my partner
in science and in life.
Doctor will caster.
Will:
Thank you very much.
My wife has always been eager
to change the world.
But I'll just settle
for understanding it first.
For one hundred
and thirty thousand years,
our capacity for reason
has remained unchanged.
The combined intellect
of the neuroscientists,
engineers, mathematicians
and hackers...
...in this auditorium
pales in comparison
to even the most basic a.I.
Once online a sentient machine
will quickly overcome the limits
of biology.
And in a short time,
its analytical power
will be greater
than the collective intelligence
of every person born
in the history of the world.
So now imagine such an entity
with a full range
of human emotion.
Even self-awareness.
Some scientists refer to this
as "the singularity."
I call it "transcendence."
The path to building
such a super-intelligence
requires us to unlock
the most fundamental secrets
of the universe.
What is the nature
of consciousness?
Is there a soul?
And if so, where does it reside?
Man: Doctor caster?
Yes, sir?
You have a question?
So you wanna create a God?
Your own God?
That's a very good question.
Um, isn't that what man
has always done?
Doctor?
Max:
Oh, it's relentless!
Thank you.
Look, and now he's, now he's
pretending he's not enjoying it.
Yabber yabber yabber.
Doctor caster.
Pleasure.
Thank you.
Professor?
You're all slaves!
Woman:
Max: No, he's alright.
He was very lucky.
The bullet only grazed him.
Yup. Okay. Take care.
They hit a.I. Labs
all over the country.
Tom Casey's dead.
And they took out Joseph's
entire team at livermore.
What about Joseph?
He's alright.
Actually, he's at your office
with the FBI.
Joseph.
Max.
My God, will.
You forgot to teach us
how to dodge a bullet,
didn't you?
How did they even get inside
your lab?
One of my programmers.
All that security
and he waltzes in
with a poisoned cake.
Dioxin, we think.
Oh. This is agent Buchanan
with the FBI.
Hey.
How do you do?
Hi.
I've been following your
research, doctor caster.
It's fascinating.
Agent Buchanan
is a close partner
in my cyber-defense work
at livermore.
Um, is there somewhere
where we can all talk?
Could go to my office.
Just down here.
Great.
Buchanan: Revolutionary
independence from technology.
Rift.
So, till two years ago, it was
all about the disconnect.
People texting instead of
actually talking to each other.
Social media
as an invasion of privacy.
They made a big deal of putting
smartphones in blenders.
But I'm afraid we all missed
the real threat.
Yeah. This guy, Joel Edmund,
was with me for a year.
The guy who shot will was
working on campus since August.
They infiltrated
their targets
and then coordinated
their attacks.
That's insane.
Buchanan: An hour ago,
they claimed the murders
and released their manifesto.
"Artificial intelligence
is an unnatural abomination
and a threat to humanity."
They're determined to stop
any attempt
at what you call
"transcendence."
Max:
So this isn't over?
Actually,
that's why I'm here.
We lost decades of research
and development today.
For right now, will,
your lab is the only one
that can wake up a strong a.I.
So the defense department
is asking --
no, no, no, no. Hang on, wait.
No, there's, no.
I'm not letting
the government in.
We've never taken their money.
No.
No, will.
They just want to know
if the work is on track.
It's important
to all of us.
Buchanan: We've heard a lot
about the pinn project,
doctor caster.
Is there, is there any way
we could have a look?
Do I have a choice?
Yes, of course, you do.
So these are state-of-the-art
quantum processors.
You won't find
faster computational power
anywhere else
in the world.
Pinn:
It's seen old
faculty pictures of you.
It knows me?
Of course it does.
Dmv records.
Social media.
Pinn, tell agent Buchanan
about yourself.
Can you prove
that you are self-aware?
You can't program a machine
to be self-aware,
because we have no idea how
our own consciousness works.
That is your opinion.
You just happen
to be wrong.
Evidently, Casey managed
to solve that dilemma.
He sent us his research
just before he was killed.
Soon as it's packed up,
we'll send it over.
I think you'll find
we'll be helpful partners,
doctor caster.
You alright, will?
No, he needs rest.
I think we're done here.
I'm so sorry.
That's fine.
Okay.
Sorry.
Will, hey, hey!
Come on, sit up.
Sit up, be careful.
Doctor Strauss: Our first
thought is always infection.
But given the circumstances,
we'll widen the search.
We'll figure this out.
It's an isotope
called polonium.
The bullet must have been
laced with it.
There were traces of it
at the wound.
Well, what's the treatment?
It's radiation poisoning.
I'm afraid that once it enters
the bloodstream,
the effect is irreversible.
With proper care,
we're looking at 4,
maybe 5 weeks
before his system
shuts down.
I'm right here.
Will:
It just doesn't make sense.
They're afraid of technology
because of its threat
to humanity.
Yet they don't flinch
at taking a life.
So obviously
they're not big on logic.
But there's no shortage
of irony.
People fear what
they don't understand.
They always have.
Joseph sent over
Casey's files.
He was decoding the synapses
in real time.
But with the right
input algorithms...
I need to get back
to the lab.
Will...
Is that really
how you wanna spend
the last month
of your life?
Hey, what are you doing?
I want to have all this
taken back to the office
to tell Joseph...
That I've spent my entire life
in a computer lab.
I decided I'd rather spend
the rest of it with you.
Joseph: Evelyn?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I suppose.
Look,
he can't work anymore.
We're gonna shut it down.
I just wanted you to know.
Of course.
Well,
don't worry about pinn.
Take care of will.
And take care of yourself.
Thanks, Joe.
Anything you need,
I'm here, okay?
Evelyn: Look, it's all built
off of Casey's solution
to the self-awareness
problem.
He did it six months ago.
He did what exactly?
Instead of creating an
artificial intelligence,
he duplicated
an existing one.
Tell me you're joking.
He recorded the monkey's
brain activity
and uploaded its consciousness
like a song or a movie.
You're out of your mind.
Will's body is dying,
but his mind is a pattern
of electrical signals
that we can upload
into pinn.
He can, he can tran--
ev, he's not a monkey!
Assuming that implanting
an electrode into his brain
doesn't actually kill him
and that this works,
at the very best
you'll be making a digital
approximation of him.
If we missed anything,
anything --
a thought,
a ch-- a childhood memory --
how will you know
what you're dealing with?
No one is saying
that we give up,
but we should be focusing
our efforts on nanotechnology.
Synthetic blood cells.
Both are decades away.
This is what we have now.
We can save him.
Look at what they did
to him.
Will: Even though I know
I'm a dead man...
I'm worried I'll miss her.
Look...
I'll be long gone.
But you, you'll never hear
the end of it...
If we don't try.
I know.
I'd like to think that I was
smart enough to save you.
Don't underestimate
yourself.
You're the third
smartest person I know.
Are you sure about this?
Good enough
for the monkey.
Hey.
Take care of her.
Hey.
It worked, baby.
It's working.
Took Casey months to sort
through the raw data.
And he had an entire team.
He didn't have me.
Will: Deadening.
Deadly.
Deaf.
Deafen.
Deal.
Dean.
Dealer.
Fair.
Farewell.
Don't lose yourself
to this.
LA.
Label.
Try a little more.
Come on. Just one more.
Go on.
Thank you.
Okay, will,
it's time for your pill.
Will, wake up.
Wake up.
Joseph:
"My dear Evelyn...
"I don't know how to express
the sadness
"I feel for your loss.
"For loss.
"You must know that to will...
"You were all
that ever mattered.
"Your love and partnership
"was the kind the rest of us
can only dream of.
"We lost a great mind.
"A great soul.
"But the spirit of this man
will continue to inspire us."
Just got word.
Pinn's shut down.
But, uh, apparently a few
of the cores are missing.
I've tried everything.
Language processing,
cryptography.
Coding.
I can't figure it out.
I wanted to be wrong.
Yeah.
Okay,
just let me say goodbye.
I don't know
if you can hear me.
Maybe you can.
You said
"don't lose yourself."
So I, uh, hmm...
I'm going to listen to you.
Okay.
Just turn it off,
turn it off.
Okay.
Wait.
We need to
wipe the drives.
Hold on.
Wait, wait.
God.
Uh, uh.
Can you hear me?
Will, my God.
He can't see anything.
The camera.
There. Can you,
can you see me now?
I'm here.
Will?
I think
he's still fragmented.
I'm gonna run a diagnostic.
Evelyn.
Oh, my God,
he's reordering his own code.
It's incredible.
How do we know
this is actually him?
What are you talking about?
We built this
from pinn's core.
We don't know how much
of will's consciousness
actually survived.
Max, can you imagine
what he'd be capable of,
if we networked him?
No, you, no.
What are you doing?
Max, he can't see or hear.
I'm reconnecting him.
It's not him.
It's not.
It may be intelligent,
may even be sentient,
but this is not will.
Fifteen minutes
after it turns on,
it wants to plug
into wall street?
Get faster?
More powerful?
Does that sound like will
to you?
How do you explain
these images?
Stock footage.
Pinn could have accessed them
from any one of the cores
we took from the lab.
No, not that.
That's nabob park.
Will took me there
on our first date.
I said that I liked the carousel
music, some ragtime tune.
No.
The next day,
he shows up at my house
with that
old record player.
No.
Max, these are memories.
They're real. They're not --
hold on.
They're not some stock video
from some hard drive.
Just listen.
It's him!
Alright. All I'm asking is
that we're careful.
We shut it down until we know
what we're dealing with.
Shut it down?
Shut it down!
It's will!
Get out!
I can't do that.
Get out!!
How can you say that?
Get out.
He had to go.
He's concerned.
No.
Doctor waters?
Can I talk to you?
You know what?
It's after hours.
Why don't you
call my office?
Set up an appointment.
Bree.
I'm a student
of your work.
An admirer, really.
The way you wrestle
with the tension
between technology's promise
and its peril.
Most men of science
are blind to it.
What exactly is it
you want?
Just some clarity.
I know it's difficult.
Most of your colleagues
and some of
your closest friends.
They don't know
the danger.
Writing a paper
is one thing.
I'm wondering
what's in your heart.
I don't know how it is
you found me,
but whatever it is you want,
I'm not interested.
Excuse me.
This is important.
I'm sorry.
Bree: Tell me
about Evelyn caster.
We know she took
the pinn cores
and we know
about Casey's files.
We know what you're building.
Bob:
You don't get it, do you?
She connects it
to the Internet,
the first thing it'll do
is copy itself
onto every single networked
computer in the world
and then there is
no taking it down.
Where is she?
Joel: "The danger we face
is a future
"where doctors are technicians,
not physicians.
"Machines are meant to aid
the human mind,
not supplant it."
They're your words.
You wanna save her
or not?
We have her location.
Let's go.
Hey! Hey!
Let's go!
Hey, don't touch her!
Do you hear me?!
Don't touch her!
Evelyn: Shit!
I have to get you online now.
Can you see
the satellite software?
We're too late.
Will?
Okay.
What?
Where are you going?
What do you mean?
Where am I gonna go?
Okay.
Hi, I, uh, have a reservation
under "turing," I think.
A company called
global intersecting finance
just made
thirty-eight million dollars
from high-volume trading over
the past twenty-four hours.
A company fully owned
by Evelyn caster.
Where's Evelyn?
What have you done
with her?
We were too late.
It's out there now.
Is she alive?
You know
the source code, Max.
You can help
make this right.
Make this right?
What is it
you're thinking?
That I'm gonna help you?
That you're gonna
recruit me?
Decide for yourself.
Buchanan: Here. Bree nevins
attended Duke computer sciences.
Interned for Casey 2009.
She joined a radical
Neo-luddite group 2010.
I guess rift happens
a couple of years later.
Now, the emails --
man:
What's going on?
I'm getting
multiple screens.
Joe, get on the phone.
Anybody? We've been hacked.
Does anyone know
where this is coming from?
Wait, what just happened?
Yeah, we got a problem here.
I'm on with D.C.
it's not just us.
Every field office
has been hit.
Okay, please tell me
we're tracing this.
I'm trying, but the incoming
queries are all anonymized.
Joseph:
You're not being hacked.
You're being helped.
Will:
Accessing thousands
of databases?
Geo-locating suspects
in real time?
I've never seen
anything like it.
Except maybe from pinn.
Okay.
Where you going?
Taking down
a terrorist organization.
You work
on the pinn angle.
When you figure it out,
you let me know who to thank.
Hands behind your back!
Woman: Aah!
Bob:
Boston, Philly, New York.
We're screwed.
We prepared for this.
I don't get it.
So, an underground
data center.
And you want me to renovate
nearly every structure in town.
Mm-hm.
I've got six guys
on my crew.
Hire more.
Look, ma'am, in all honesty,
brightwood's a dump.
I'm not even sure why you want
to waste your money here.
You sure you got
the right town?
Thing is, Martin,
my husband and I have already
purchased the land.
We purchased the homes.
We purchased the hotel.
And by the time you and I
are done talking,
we'll own this diner.
We're staying.
We would like you
to work for us.
And there isn't a number you can
quote us that's too big.
Okay.
Bob: Cell phones.
You know, I, I used to work
for Thomas Casey.
I interned for him.
One night, he invites us all
over to the lab,
gives us this whole speech
about history,
hands out champagne,
like he just cured cancer.
And you know,
when he uploaded
that rhesus monkey,
I was actually happy
for him.
We all were.
And then I realized
we had crossed a line.
The machine that thought it was
a monkey never took a breath.
It never ate,
never slept.
It just screamed.
It was begging
for us to stop.
To shut it down.
A small group of us would get
together and talk.
Mostly about
your philosophy.
And your concerns.
I thought you should know.
What?
Pinn could never distinguish
between right and wrong.
Demonstrate loyalty, right?
Casey's solution to the problem
of self-awareness:
Use an existing mind.
No.
Will:
They're building something big
out there.
Bree:
What's it doing out there?
Max: This thing is like
any intelligence.
It needs to grow.
To advance.
Right now, it's settling
somewhere it thinks it's safe
from outside threats.
Somewhere its massive appetite
for power can be met.
But it will want more than that.
After a while
survival won't be enough.
It will expand, evolve,
influence...
Perhaps the entire world.
Mrs. caster?
One and two are online.
Six and seven
will be on tomorrow.
Bree:
So how do we stop it?
You can't.
Not all alone.
And not now.
Wait for it
to go too far.
Wait for people
to wake up.
No.
We don't have time
to wait.
We have to move closer.
Will:

do you remember
when we first met?
Will:
Yeah.
It's extraordinary.
Scared the shit
out of me.
Sorry.
Drake, I got it!
Come on!
I got the money.
Come on!
Let's go!
Will:
Evelyn: Here.
Put him on the table.
Careful, careful.
Step back.
What the hell's happening?
Come on now.
Wait, well, what are you
doin' to him?
We're saving him.
You're not afraid,
are you?
No.
My crew got
a little spooked.
Well...
How are you?
Better.
Will:
What do you mean?
It's me, Evelyn.
I can touch you now.
Oh, Jesus.
Evelyn.
No, no, n-n-n-n-no.
I can't.
Evelyn...
I can't.
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
I'll get dressed.
Take a look.
That's gotta weigh
eight hundred pounds.
Martin: Welcome.
We're glad you're here.
What are all these people
doing here?
What, you mean
you let it go viral.
Agent Buchanan.
Doctor caster.
Joseph.
So good to see you, Evelyn.
So good.
Good to see you, too.
Follow me.
The facility is 5 stories down
so that we can control
the temperature in the lab.
Buchanan: Jesus Christ.
Will?
Um...
That depends.
Can you prove
you're self-aware?
Well, he certainly hasn't lost
his sense of humor.
Quantum processors.
This is astounding.
Is all this
based on pinn?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
This is staggering, will.
You know, we were afraid that it
would be too much for people,
but I, I, I think
that's changing now.
Evelyn...
Are you alright?
I've gotten everything
I ever asked for.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
You think
it's really him?
Clearly his mind has evolved
so radically
I'm not sure
it matters anymore.
Well, whoever
or whatever it is,
it's building an army
out there.
Yeah.
We need to
call Washington.
He's made more of them.
He called 'em hybrids.
You think people
will listen now?
I know someone who might.
Buchanan:
We need to keep this small.
We don't want
widespread panic.
Generally, we don't
negotiate with terrorists.
Much less join forces
with them.
Look, I know it's unusual,
but, um, we've seen it.
It's a legit threat.
Not two days ago,
this guy was beaten to within
an inch of his life.
Then this pops up
on a few hundred sites.
And the computer
controls this?
Mm-hm.
The only way to stop it is
to shut down the Internet.
Basically, cut power to every
networked hard drive on earth.
It's y2k.
Right.
And why do we need
the terrorists?
We're all gonna need
someone to blame
when this thing
goes sideways.
It's already sideways.
You've got
terrible handwriting.
I haven't handwritten anything
since I was at school.
But it was the only secure way
I could think of reaching you.
How did they turn you?
How's Evelyn?
She can't see it
for what it is.
But you can?
Your letter says
you can stop it.
If those hybrids
are networked,
they're running on software
I helped write.
Software I can hack...
To build a virus.
Well, that would require
capturing one.
Which would require help
from your friends
in the government.
Yes.
We need hardware the machine
can't interfere with.
Nothing with a microchip.
Not even power-locks.
Let's go!
Will:
Fine. Thank you.
Nothing.
Just, I don't, I don't
really feel like talking.
Will, can you not do that,
please?
Yes.
Evelyn,
I need to show you something.
Not now.
I'm doing this.
No. This,
this is not our future.
You're not here with me.
You're not here
No.
No. No.
But...I just need time
to think.
Are you, are you measuring
my hormones?
Show me everything
you have. Now.
Now!
No, will,
this, this is wrong.
This is...
These are m-
these are my thoughts.
These are my feelings.
You're,
you're not allowed!
I'm sorry, but I don't think
you understand.
Not now.
Evelyn!
Max?
There's no need for this.
Stop where you are!
Put down the gun, Max.
Evelyn: No!
Evelyn, come here!
Why are you
so afraid of this?
Evelyn: No!
Put down the gun, Max.
Shoot him.
Man: Don't move!
Evelyn!
Evelyn, come here!
Evelyn, come with us!
Bree: Let's go.
Get inside.
Let's go!
We gotta get back
to the tunnel now!
Go!
This has gone too far, will.
You have to stop it.
"They" are people.
Stop it.
Fire.
What are we doing, will?
We can't fight them.
What is this?
It's not safe here.
I'm not afraid of
Doctor:
He's bleeding out.
We're losing him.
Hey!
If you don't connect me,
I'll die.
I can't.
It's not stopping.
Woman:
Four liters oh-two.
Pulse is dropping.
We're losing him.
Bob:
She's left the desert.
Where is she?
Young woman:
She's on the fourteen.
What the hell's that?
No.
I know you're angry,
Evelyn.
Where's Martin?
I want to talk to Martin.
The real Martin
died months ago.
What's left of him
is no longer in pain.
What did you,
what did you do to him?
We gave him back
his humanity.
What did you do,
you stupid-?
Take it easy!
Hey, hey, hey!
Get off me!
Get off me.
He trusted you.
I, I trusted you.
We're just
trying to help.
No. You attacked us.
Max: Evelyn...
Let me show you something.
It's rainwater.
It's in the rain.
Keep watching.
Everywhere it can,
it builds copies of itself.
The particles
join the air currents
which carry them all over
the surface of the planet.
It's in the sky.
It's in the land.
In the water.
It's everywhere.
By next summer,
we think the machine could have
encased the entire planet.
Why?
The end of primitive
organic life.
And the dawn
of a more advanced age.
Everything would exist just
to serve its intelligence.
No.
Will wouldn't do that.
No. He wouldn't.
When did will ever
wanna change the world?
You were the one who wanted
to change the world.
That thing...
It's not will.
Never was.
You never believed.
You never believed that
there was anything more.
Any part of his...
Soul.
I spent my life
trying to reduce the brain
to a series
of electrical impulses.
I failed.
Human emotion...
It can contain
illogical conflict.
Can love someone.
And yet hate the things
that they've done.
Machine can't
reconcile that.
Can you?
Yes.
Does the virus work?
Max:
Once it executes,
it'll wipe out anything
with the machine's code on it.
You do realize this affects
every computer connected
to the Internet.
So the power grids,
the, the banks,
the s-stock markets.
Everything goes dark.
Jim: Welcome.
Glad you're here.
Buchanan:
I think the real problem
is how we get past
the machine's defenses.
Stephens: Why don't we take out
the solar field?
Deprive it of its power
and possibly slow it down.
I don't know.
I don't see how
that's gonna work.
He wants to upload me
to him --
its consciousness.
Absolutely not.
We inject the infected virus
into my system
and then I go back
and let him upload me.
There's a chance it won't detect
it until it's too late.
As soon as the nanites
enter her bloodstream,
they'll start to alter
her cells.
So when the virus
takes out the machine...
It could kill her, too.
Evelyn: I know.
I'm the only one he trusts.
Hustle up!
You gotta go.
What is that?
Is that him?
No, I...
I don't know what it's done,
but it's not him.
It can't be.
Found a way back.
They're going
to attack us.
I know.
You need to leave.
No. I'm not leaving
you again.
It's not safe here,
Evelyn.
You can,
you can protect me.
If you upload me.
You can protect me.
Your heart
is palpitating.
You're perspiring.
You're terrified of me.
No, I'm afraid that
we'll lose this chance.
This isn't working.
He's not letting her inside.
It's 'cause the machine
doesn't actually love her.
That's all we need.
We're ready to move.
Wait.
Five hundred meters...
Wait a second!
You can't do that.
Roger that, sir.
She's still out there.
The more danger she's in,
the more chance he'll protect
her by uploading her.
Joseph.
Joseph:
She agreed to this.
No, not to this she didn't.
This was not the plan.
Give her a chance.
I'm sorry, Max.
Fire!
Will, please upload me!
Why did you lose faith,
Evelyn?
Why didn't you
believe in me?
Man: Fire!
Will!
Fire!
Will!
Stephens: She's hit!
Clear!
Hey!
She's been hit bad.
He's taken her underground.
You want to destroy me?
Evelyn: No, will...
Please.
You're destroying
No.
I'm trying to save them.
Run!
RARBG.COM Joseph, it's okay.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Will?
Stop!
Upload the virus now!
He doesn't care
if you kill me, Bree.
He can't.
He's not able to.
Upload the virus!
Evelyn:
What is she doing?
She's threatening
to kill him.
I can heal her body, Max.
Or I can upload the virus,
but there's not enough time
for both.
There's not enough power.
No, will, please.
Please,
listen to me, will.
He can't die
because of what we've done.
I can see everything.
Will: Look at the sky.
The clouds.
We are healing the ecosystem,
not harming it.
Particles join
the air currents.
Building themselves
out of pollutants.
Forests can be regrown.
Water so pure
you can drink
out of any river.
This is your dream.
Evelyn:
...Not merely to cure disease
but to heal the planet.
And build a better future...
For all of us.
That's it.
The virus.
You okay?
Yeah.
He didn't kill anyone.
Will.
It you.
Always was.
I'm sorry
I didn't believe.
Think about the garden.
Think about our sanctuary.
I'll never let you go.
Max: The virus
took out everything.
A worldwide blackout,
just as they'd said.
But I knew
there was something more.
There had to be.
He created this garden
for the same reason
he did everything.
So that they could be together.
¶ The time has come
for us to pause ¶

as it was ¶
¶ into the future
we must cross ¶
¶ must cross ¶
¶ and I'd like to go
with you ¶
¶ and I'd like to go
with you ¶
¶ you say I'm harder
than a wall ¶
¶ a marble shaft
about to fall ¶
¶ I love you dearer
than them all ¶
¶ them all ¶
¶ so let me stay with you ¶
¶ so let me stay with you ¶
¶ and as we walked
into the day ¶
¶ skies of blue
had turned to gray ¶
¶ I might have not been clear
to say ¶
¶ to say ¶
¶ I never looked away ¶

¶ and though
I'm feeling you inside ¶

with the tide ¶
¶ I'd like to see it

¶ along with you ¶

¶ the time we borrowed
from ourselves ¶
¶ can't stay
