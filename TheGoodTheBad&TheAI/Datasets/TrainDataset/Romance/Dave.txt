Ten-hut!
Welcome home, Mr. President.
Over here, Mr. President!
Good to be home.
-What do you got?
-Let's go over it again.
Who do I see first this morning?
You've got Mr. Crenshaw at 1 1 :30.
I can't do two things at once.
I got NSC at 2:30.
-That'll only take half an hour.
-With Syria?
You have the radio address...
...and the Legal Counsel speech
at the Monroe tomorrow.
The Monroe?
Welcome home, Mr. President.
Yes, sir, the Monroe Hotel.
Have you got a double for me?
-We're working on it.
-Good.
Try to find someone
who looks like me this time.
That last guy was a joke.
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is...
...the President of the United States.
God bless you. Thank you.
Welcome to Durenberger's, Mr. President.
Thank you, one and all.
Let me just say,
from one chief executive to another...
...that there is no Chevrolet
like Durenberger's Community Chevrolet.
Thank you, Mr. President.
That's not the president, is it?
I sure hope not.
I have the feeling that when people
find out about the $500 cash rebate...
...on all Geo Storms
and Geo Storm convertibles...
...that you'll be even busier than I am.
You said it, Mr. President.
I could veto this Simpson-Gardner thing
if I wanted to, but I don't.
Do you know why?
It's got homeless shelters...
...and Head Start centers...
...and....
Hot lunches.
Hot lunches for little kiddies.
If I kill it, I'm going to look like a prick.
I don't want to look like a prick.
I want you to look like pricks.
But, sir, we tried to kill it.
Twice.
I don't think so. If you killed it,
it would be dead.
When I kill something...
...it always dies.
-Doesn't it, Bob?
-Always did.
Mr. President, with all the work
your wife does with the homeless--
My wife.
I don't want you to do this
because you're forced to.
I want you to do this because you want to.
I want you to do it
because it's the right thing to do.
Do it because you're acting
in the best interests of your country.
Well, I think that's it.
-Perfect.
-Great. I'll see you then.
How are you? Having fun?
Good to see you.
Ask me how I did.
-How'd it go?
-I killed them. It was great.
-See what you can do in here.
-Okay, what's up?
How are you, Mabel? Hi, Jennifer.
Mabel says it's too far.
Jennifer's boss tried to hit on her.
Lola's been in your office crying
for almost an hour.
What happened?
It's not my fault. I learn on the IBM, okay?
Then they put me on the Wang.
Don't worry. We'll think of something.
So tonight's the big night.
It's some secret. He won't tell me.
It'll be fine. We'll fix it.
Honey, call Murray.
Tell him we're on our way, okay?
It's Wednesday. Everybody works.
Can I borrow your-- Thanks.
I can't hire anybody else. I can't.
She flies on an IBM.
I don't have enough work
for the people you already gave me.
She's got three kids.
Her husband's a diabetic.
Just a short-term thing. Temp job.
Please?
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
You feel okay about this?
Not yet.
You will.
Do you want to go play some ball?
It's the middle of the day. I'm working.
Me, too. Okay, well, thanks.
See you tomorrow.
'Bye, Lola, Kate, Adriana, Pam.

Mr. Kovic?
I'm Duane Stevenson
with the United States Secret Service.
We're with the federal government.
I swear I thought that was
a legitimate deduction....
I do impersonations,
so I use that TV for my work.
Mr. Kovic,
we're not here about your taxes.
On occasion, for security purposes,
we hire a double for the president...
...at public functions
in exposed situations.
Your government needs your help.
Really?
I like it.
You look just like him.
You think?
And the coloring....
Coloring is excellent.
-His hair's this short?
-It's a perfect match.
Not over the ears?
You understand what you'll be doing?
You want me to wave.
Wave from the door,
come downstairs, get into the limo.
You know, if you want me
to do other stuff, I can.
-lf you want me to talk--
-Don't say a word.
Right.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.
Thank you all.
Is there a lawyer in the house?
You know...
...as I came to the podium,
I saw my friend, Jordan Blankfort.
Now Justice Blankfort...
...who I haven't seen
since our law school days at Yale....
You know, just seeing him makes me...
...kind of nostalgic
for those innocent days back then.
The worst thing we did was hoist
a guy's underwear up a flagpole.
Let's go.
...struggling pilgrims...
...who imagined a system of laws...
...of the people, by the people...
...and for all the decent people
of this land! God bless you!
God bless America!
Let's move it up a half hour.
You have the trade negotiations.
It needs to be handled.
He's here.
They weren't enthusiastic.
Of course, they're lawyers.
Jesus Christ!
You're a very handsome man.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Just get rid of the grin.
You look like a schmuck.
He's all right.
Wish me luck.
Call me if there's a war.
Move him out.
You're on.
Okay, you ready?
Mr. President?
President Mitchell!
God bless you! God bless America!
Thank you very much!
I'm sorry. I just couldn't help it.
I got carried away.
I was pretty good, wasn't I?
Something important must be going on
for the president to do this.
Something top secret.
Baby?
Hon?
Mr. President?
Doesn't look very good.
It hit both sides of his brain.
If he makes it, he'll be a vegetable.
-I can't believe he'd do this.
-I know.
-Where's the girl?
-She's upset.
-We have her upstairs.
-Some nightmare.
At some point we'll have to call
the vice-president.
Don't call the vice-president!
Don't call him.
-The guy's in a coma!
-I don't give a shit.
This is mine, Al. It's all mine.
I made him. I built him.
And no Boy Scout
is going to take it away from me...
...just because he happens to be
vice-president of the United States.
You know...
...if you want to do something
for his birthday, I've got great stuff.
I do this thing. My friends love it.
The president and the first lady
are going to Club Med...
...for their vacation....
Oh, sir.
Back to the cottage.
We'll start by going on TV.
We'll admit he had a stroke,
but we'll say it was a mild stroke.
A mild stroke?
And he ought to be up and around again
sometime soon.
Up and around?
How?
You know...
...l'm not scared.
I've been cooperative.
I'd just like to know where we're going.
I'm Alan Reed,
White House communications director.
This is Bob Alexander, our chief of staff.
We met at the hotel tonight, remember?
Can I get you a drink?
You sure? Coke, mineral water?
I'm fine.
Dave, something has come up
and I think we need to talk about it.
I'm so sorry.
I know I wasn't supposed to talk...
...but I saw the crowd and got excited--
We're not upset with you.
We think you did a great job.
Don't worry about it.
Terrific.
In fact you did such a good job...
...that we'd like to...
...extend things a little.
Extend things?
Extend them.
Come here.
Try it out.
-Try it out?
-Go ahead.
How's that feel?
Very nice.
Dave...
...the reason we invited you here tonight
is because...
...something happened to the president.
Oh, my God!
I know, it's difficult for all of us, but...
...we need to put
our personal feelings aside and focus...
...on the good of the country.
What happened?
It's actually kind of serious, Dave.
The president's not in very good shape.
Will he be okay?
-Probably.
-I think so.
Sometimes we need our friends...
...and even our enemies, to feel...
...safe and secure.
We need them to feel
like they can go to bed at night...
...knowing that President Mitchell
is fully in control.
We need them to feel like...
...he's sitting right here...
...in this chair.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
What about the vice-president?
Vice-president?
We didn't want to have to tell you this...
...but the vice-president
is mentally unbalanced.
I'm afraid so.
Really?
Crazy?
Certifiable.
How much do you usually get paid?
I don't know.
Depends.
Usually it's a...
...barter kind of thing.
Is this legal?
Have you ever driven through a red light?
You know...
...on an empty road when there's
nobody around and you know it's safe?
I'm not sure. I might have.
Well, let's say...
...let's say your mother
is in the car and you...
...have to get her to the hospital.
You'd do it then for sure, right?
Yes, I guess I would.
Now, let's say...
...the whole country...
...is in the car.
The entire United States of America.
-In the car?
-In the car.
I see what you mean.
Dave, the country is sick.
And you'll get it to the hospital.
These are the private quarters.
The president's bedroom is there,
the first lady's is there.
First lady?
You won't even see her.
They barely talk anymore.
-You're kidding.
-It happens.
And this is where you'll be sleeping.
You all right?
-It's very nice.
-Come this way.
I'm sure you'll be comfortable here.
We'll be back to get you in the morning.
The Secret Service man
is outside the door.
Good night, Mr. President.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
Thank you.
Nothing. Good night.
Nothing.
Good night.
At 10:45 last night, President Mitchell...
...coming home from giving
a speech to the Legal Counsel...
...suffered a minor circulatory problem
of the head.
Reports that he had suffered
a severe stroke are erroneous.
Doctors report that he should be back
to his normal schedule soon.
Now let me stress again,
this is a minor medical problem.
The president has complete use
of his faculties...
...and retains full executive authority.
Any questions?
Do you know how many laws
we've broken?
It's simple, Alan.
We send the vice-president
to Africa or something.
We dig up some dirt on him
and then force him to resign...
...and get our president
to nominate a new one.
It will take a couple of weeks.
You mean, we get Dave
to nominate you as vice-president?
I was a senator.
Oh, I know.
And when our poor president
has another stroke...
...this time much more serious...
...our newly appointed VP becomes....
Jeez.
What about containment?
Thanks.
We got the nurses for 50 grand apiece,
and the doctors for 100.
The older guy wanted a head of the CDC.
Is that everybody?
Duane's got his guys under control.
Good. What about her?
Her?
Oh, the first lady?
When she gave her speech at Bryn Mawr,
I managed to catch her before she left.
And?
I told her his blood pressure went up
after an incident at the hotel.
She hates him more than ever.
Fine.
Everybody else is buying
the ''minor stroke'' story.
Let's hope this yutz can pull it off.
These are amazing results. I must say,
even for a man with a minor stroke...
...you seem to have made
a remarkable recovery.
Great.
I'm feeling better.
No signs of paralysis.
No circulatory changes.
Your ECG is completely normal and...
...your blood pressure has gone down.
Have you been exercising recently?
Yes. I mean...
...bicycling and...
...weight lifting.
Looking after the diet.
Polo, climbing...
...like that.
Well, judging by these tests,
I see no reason why you can't...
...return to work in a few days.
-Great.
-Good.
Good.
Good.
Hold it.
Remember everybody's name, faces?
Keep it simple.
Course. Watch.
'Morning, ladies.
-Good to see you.
-Welcome back, sir.
Good to be back. Just a false alarm.
Nothing to worry about.
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Nice to see you.
It's good to be alive, isn't it?
Good morning, Mr. President.
I was really worried.
I didn't know what was going on.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Why didn't you call me?
-You really had me worried!
-Well, I'm fine.
-What's with her?
-Ignore it.
She's emotional.
She's attached to the president.
Remember, you are the president.
Okay, let's get back to work.
Sick time is done. Let's call the--
False alarm. I'm fine. Everything's fine.
He's okay.
Let's go over it again.
You met a girl. You fell in love.
And we're going away.
For a month.
-A month?
-Right. Don't embellish.
Do I need to dial nine?
As soon as we sat down...
...he pulls out this ring
and I got so emotional...
...I had to ask the waiter
to bring another napkin.
Hang on.
Kovic Temps.
Where are you?
You met who?
You're going where?
Cancun?
Oh, I think that's great.
She's very special. She's beautiful.
She's a princess.
She's really exotic and wonderful.
She's Polynesian.
Well, half Polynesian and half American.
She's Amnesian.
Hang up.
-She has a hang-up though.
-Hang up the phone.
Don't talk about that when you meet her.
I've gotta go now. I'll call you later. 'Bye.
It worked.
He's in love.
Thank God.
The president continued convalescing,
resting for the second day.
His personal physician
pronounced him in perfect health.
I have examined him thoroughly...
...and I don't believe I have ever seen
the president in better shape.
The upper house and the lower house.
Senators are elected to six-year terms
and congressmen are elected to two.
Judiciary?
Veterans Affairs?
Mark Davis.
Agriculture?
Cows, cows, calves, Metcalf.
Lawrence Metcalf. He's right there.
This is Sander Vanocur
at the White House.
First we'll go over mannerisms.
Alan has worked out a training program.
Great.
This is the briefing room...
...where the president
holds his press conferences.
This may seem strange at first, but...
...even real politicians have trouble
getting used to the cameras--
A TelePrompTer.
A TelePrompTer. Is it hooked up?
I don't think so.
As I was saying, no one expects you
to be Bill Mitchell overnight.
The most important thing
to remember is his general presence.
Now, whenever he stands at the podium...
...President Mitchell always has
one hand in the pocket of his coat.
At a press conference.
Otherwise, they're always on the podium.
I'm not certain about that.
Remember the convention speech?
''An America,
stronger than the one we were given.
''An America,
prouder than the one we found.''
Right there on the podium.
Except on ''America,'' he points.
That's very good.
Oh, I love that speech.
Thanks. I wrote it.
You did?
It's great!
''Somewhere, there is a distant light...
''...guiding us through this rocky shoal.
''America isn't what we say here tonight.
''lt's in the faces and the smiles
of a Sunday afternoon.
''lt's in the gentle kindness...
''...of the family kitchen...
''...as we gather together...
''...when the sun goes down.''
Can I keep this?
-I thought I wouldn't see her.
-Just five minutes.
She walks in, you wave, she leaves.
First lady. I mean,
couldn't I start with a cousin?
She hardly ever sees him.
It'll be fast, she won't be able to tell.
Stop whining.
If you can convince her,
you can convince anybody.
All right.
We're ready for Mrs. Mitchell.
As soon as she comes in,
we'll move you out to the balcony.
All you have to say is,
''Thanks for doing this, Ellen.''
''Thanks for doing this, Ellen.''
She doesn't always like this stuff.
It might soften her up.
''Thanks for doing this, Ellen.''
Why can't you die from a stroke
like everybody else?
What are you staring at?
Mrs. Mitchell, we're going to do it up here.
Who was she?
Another patriotic secretary?
Thank you for doing this, Ellen.
Go to hell, Bill.
I think we can start now.
And you can tell these two pit vipers...
...that this is the last one of these
I'll do for awhile.
You're doing just fine.
Wave!
Mr. President, how are you feeling?
Fine.
Fine.
Ready to get back to work?
You bet.
You bet.
I'm out of here.
Shit.
Are you making the decisions?
Are you back in charge?
Go!
Go, go, go!
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Thank you for doing this, Ellen.
You don't change, do you?
She hates me.
Wave to the camera. Wave to the camera.
Here we go. First we'll talk to...
...Ted on the new
Land Management Legislation.
I think if you refer to ltem 3
on the memorandum...
...you'll notice that the....
Slip your arms in there, and the machine
will do everything your arms do.
I once caught a fish...
...this big.
This is great.
Everybody!
Good boy!
Got you!
This guy has had a rebirth.
This is a different fella.
It's not often, but when you're right,
you're right.
There's been a transformation.
What's in the water over there?
It's not the water
or anything else you drank.
He has faced death in the eye
and has been transformed by it.
-The boss looks better since the stroke.
-Thanks, Mr. Speaker.
-He's doing well.
-Thanks.
-I'll tell him.
-Tell him I send him my best.
Good to see you.
Let me ask you a question now:
What is with the president lately?
The guy's been having too many
Happy Meals for lunch or what?
Let's talk about desserts.
What you don't want to do
is eat doughnuts.
No doughnuts.
Thank you, Arnold.
Arnold, thank you so much.
Want to Indian-wrestle?
...on major issues of the day.
Here's the moderator, John McLaughlin.
Issue 1 : the new Bill Mitchell.
Two weeks after his brush with death...
...the president's bounding
around the country...
...with the energy
of a high-school track star.
Is this merely overcompensation...
...or the indefatigable greatness
of a truly great man?
So the...
...first lady and the president....
What is that?
How long has that been going on?
I can't say.
You mean, you don't know
or you can't say?
I can't say.
Can't say.
So your job is to protect the president
all the time? That's your whole job?
Have a gun?
Ever use it?
Not yet.
I've always wondered about you guys.
They say you'd take a bullet
for the president.
What about it?
Is that true?
Would you let yourself be killed
to save his life?
Certainly.
So that means now you would
get killed for me, too.
It'd be great for you
and great for the president.
I'm sorry, the only time
I have available is the 25th.
Are you crazy?
That's the best I can do.
I'll get back to you.
You scheduled a day with the first lady?
-It's a homeless shelter.
-Oh, excuse me.
It's going to be great.
Caring about his wife,
spending time on her favorite issues.
I don't want him caring about his wife.
What about the vice-president?
The vice-president?
Well, you remember that First Liberty stuff
we almost got nailed on?
I just dumped it on him instead.
-When does it break?
-Few days.
Look at Dave's tracking polls.
They'll burn up in your hands.
Seventy-three percent with seniors,
eighty-four percent with working mothers.
We still gotta control this guy.
Why are you doing this?
What?
Since when do you care
about the homeless?
I care about the homeless.
I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. President.
Good morning, kids. How are you?
Thank you for that nice welcome.
They are all kids.
That's right, Bill. Kids are homeless, too.
Where are the parents?
A lot of them are in shelters,
but some are still on the street.
Shake hands.
Hi, there.
Hello.
-What's your name?
-Brandon.
How do you do?
What happens when kids
become homeless is...
...they lose communication skills.
So here they play a lot of games...
...that encourage kids to relate
to each other and to express themselves.
Oh, no, poor Joe...
...he has no hair.
Oh, no, poor Joe...
...he has no...
...eyes.
Right. Very good. Let's try one more.
Everybody together, now.
Everybody pay attention.
Oh, no, poor Joe.
-He has no....
-Feet.
Great, great, great. All right.
Hi, there.
What's your name?
David.
David?
Great name.
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
Hey, guys. Not now, okay?
Thanks.
Don't you like playing games with them?
Do you like magic?
It's okay.
Okay.
Watch this.
Where'd it go?
The answer is in this riddle.
What can run all day
without ever getting tired?
Do you know?
I'll give you a hint.
It's not your ear.
And it's not your mouth.
My nose.
Your nose.
Exactly. And look, there it is.
See? It was there all the time.
It went up in the air.
And fell on my nose.
Is the first lady still there?
Does she look mad?
Not really.
Good.
First cover of ''Time'' magazine
and I need a shave.
Tough little moment with the dog.
There you are on the cover.
Good, huh? Front page.
-That's you behind me.
-Where, what?
See? Here's me.
Look here.
You see those 20 guys and then,
bing, there you are.
-This is me?
-Looking very strong and...
...forbidding.
Have you ever thought about wearing
a sweater! You'd blend in more.
There you are again,
coming off the helicopter.
Sweaters make my neck look too thick.
Really? You got a sweater vest?
You could wear a tie.
Would a sweater vest look good on me?
Where's the Simpson-Gardner paperwork?
Excuse me. It's right here.
-Just came in.
-I think he's going to veto it.
Bill Mitchell...
...votes no.
''Hail to the Chief
He's the one we all say 'Hail' to
''We all say 'Hail' to the Chief
'Cause he keeps himself so clean.''
He's got the power.
That's why he's in the shower.
I can't believe you would do
something like this.
Not even you.
How could you?
What?
Don't patronize me.
I'm not one of your bimbos.
And turn around.
I'm talking to you. Turn around.
Turn around.
If you want to be the same old selfish...
...bastard.
Go ahead. I've gotten used to it.
But don't put on this ''man of the people''
routine and then do something like this.
I don't understand.
You know that wasn't
a Works Bill you vetoed.
That would've given those kids homes!
When I think of that spectacle you put on
with that boy and the magic trick.
What's wrong with the magic trick?
It was some magic.
You made their funding disappear!
If there's some mistake--
When you veto their funding,
that's not a mistake.
When you hurt someone intentionally,
that's not a mistake.
Call Bob. Call Alan. I want to see them.
But it's 10:30 at night.
You got it.
What the hell is this?
What is this?
''The New York Times.''
No, this.
''President vetoes Works Bill.''
We vetoed that?
We didn't veto anything.
These things get awfully complicated
sometimes, and you have to--
The shelter was in this bill.
-Handle this.
-Believe me, Dave, if we could have--
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Listen, you little shit!
The budget is a very complicated thing.
I don't understand it sometimes.
Occasionally, we have to make some cuts.
And in order--
But we went there.
-We saw those kids.
-Yes, you did.
And if you find a way to cut
$650 million from the budget...
...you can keep your shelters.
And by the way...
...don't ever send for me again.
Can I help you?
I'm here to see the president.
Is that right?
He asked me to come.
And your name?
Murray Blum. B-L-U-M.
Come on, Dave.
-Sit down.
-I don't want to sit there.
-Come on.
-I don't want to. Please.
Okay, fine.
This place is probably bugged.
It's not bugged. It's okay, Murray.
You could get in so much trouble
if they find out.
-Who?
-The government.
I'm the government.
Wild, huh?
I can't tell you the whole story.
It's a national emergency thing.
You've gotta help me cut the budget.
You need to cut the budget?
About 650 million dollars.
You look hungry?
Please come in here.
Just watch.
Yes, Mr. President?
We need two copies of the budget.
And could you arrange for dinner for two
in the dining room?
Right away, sir.
We have work to do
so we're not to be disturbed.
I understand, sir.
Do you think they could rustle up
some bratwurst and mustard?
I think it can be arranged.
I love bratwurst.
I know.
