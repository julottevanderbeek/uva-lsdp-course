That there is Eddie again
something touching?
If, some new nike arrived
to the store, it is brilliant
Leave me reformular the question
Is there urgado some vagina?
No, dad, there is not urgado
any vagina
Seriously...
Seriously dad, alone that
I am not going out for the time being with anybody
Not I understand, if you refuse yourself to marry it is
to refuse you to enjoy the life, it is as...
...to live in the purgatory
Dad, I don't refuse myself to marry
alone I want to make it with the suitable person
Pardon to bother you but
I want you to be happy
I hate that are alone
a lifetime
He won't be,
I will go to a wedding
Ah already knows, the weddings are a good place
to know women
Who does marry?
Jodi
- That?
- Seriously?
- Dad goes!
- Eddie, don't make you this
We are still friends
Alone I say that to walk somewhere around
with your former-engaged one...
...he/she smells a little to...
No, we already pass that
Everything will be Catholic
We will be alone a little close
I believe that you should not make it
but perhaps alone I am antiquated
He/she forgets the wedding, your and I go to Las Vegas
with luck hayaremos a couple of women
If, I have to say that the idea
of going out with my setentero father it is tempting...
...but I already made plans, but
I appreciate the offer, we go
- Can he/she give me a beer?
- I want a Cosmopolitan
Cosmopolitan?
- Is a drink of women not?

If, it has induced me
- Deveras?

It handcuffs happy, happy life
That is good, happy wife
happy life, likes me

- Thank you
You look at it, it is grandiose hey
If, it is very good
You vé that leaves to conserve,
he/she looks at the mom
Girl go
Hey goes
You were five years old for
to pull the trigger with Jodi, ok?
There are enough reasons to make it
If, but even memory
as era
"He doesn't like my fantasy of the soccer"
"He/she never attempts anything new"
That is not my voice
That is exactly your
I don't hear myself as a ratoncillo
- a little
- " I don't speak this way"
Ok, do you remember this?
"She hates the Cadi Shaka"
" if, and you know for that hates
the cadi shaka?"
" it is heard very false"
We go, that would bother you
Totally, the opportunity leaves to the garbage
of being happy, because the girlfriend is false
We go, you should already marry
You are 40 years old, in some moment
you should close the eyes and to jump
I made it and I am the type
but happy

Not it is the table of children
It is the table of single, enjoy it

Because it owed me money

And allow me to tell you something but
about my hobby

Thank you
Hey for Bearl and Beau
Do we have to pay for that reason?
You are a baseball trainer
It is brilliant
In fact, Beau taenia the one
I equip before the one
He/she never got lost a game
in 28 years
There were some games that God willing
I had gotten lost
Miranda also taenia their team
- It is this way
- Are you entrenadora?
That is... wau,
the whole family has trainers
There is an I articulate on them
in the newspaper
You can chatear with them
in it lines
Is it surprising that there are of you?
Not I am a trainer
I have a couple of stores
Not forget the third
that taenias in the 27
You can return
- We will open another in that area
- The best thing
Don't allow it to enter
to the I circulate
We want to maintain a good organization
- So we will hurry
- And we will be there this time
- That well?
- And your Eddie?
Do you sell things of sports?
I make it, in fact I have
a store of sports in San Francisco
In fact I lost my opportunity

If, a couple of boys me
they put below and...
Not beautiful fué
Did you lift positions?
- No, it was...
- He/she was joking
About anal violation
For that assume that the aliens
of the space ships people are?
For that could not be
perhaps cows?
Of that planet
- Certain
- Do you understand what I say?
Even if the cows were capable
of flying ships
People of the planet would continue
looking for the cows
You say, he/she looks at the cows in
stupid UFOS
Or IFO, because they know what is
If, exactly
Ok, I can say that your family...
...I love them, they are wonderful
Thank you
With an exception
It is a little tender the...
- ... Mervin
- Martin!
If, I sit down that Martin this
Alone a little antiquated?
Friend! That is my cousin!
Alone he/she said that he/she is an idiot
For that don't forget this
because it is something...
he/she is their best friend
As one week a month
I suppose that it is something that
he/she has to happen
- And your you wanted him to happen?
- He is of those that they like the routine
He didn't want to formalize
Do you mean that he/she didn't want to marry?
- Can you believe it?
- No
Which the problem is?
That it passes him/her?
So I told him/her that
taenia that to take a respiration
And in little time I realized
of the different thing that we were
That there are of you? Do you have a girlfriend at home?
Where demons have you been?
I have looked for you for 45 moinutos
All are very drunk
- And?
- And?
Nobody takes care anybody
- I thought that you were in the highway
- Oh shit
Do you find amusing? For that don't go
to clean everything
Martin, relax you
We will fish tomorrow,
do you want to come?
A moment, we cannot invite
to anyone to come
I will speak with the captain
Forget it, anyway
I cannot go
Good night
Where you have been?
It was below
Below? You left 7 hours ago
and you said that alone you will have dinner
It was this way, it was in the bar
with Jimmy Chongos...
...it was inside
Jimmy Chongos doesn't take a long time so much
No, quick fué,
then the lupus came out
I knew a wonderful couple
to who I said that we were of honeymoon
And they invited me a swig,
and then another group, and then they were many swigs
- Which another group?
- Another group, this...
There in the bar, but very pleasant
of Jimmy's Crankcase type
Eddie, that doesn't explain because you arrive
at 4 o'clock if the bar closes at two o'clock
Affection said that you wanted to sleep, so
he/she didn't want to bother and I went to the beach to see the waves
You were in the beach everything
this time
- Deveras?
- If, affection
I sit down it, I didn't want
to distrust of you, alone...
...that I am very miserable
and it leaves me everything of the nose...
- .. I cannot sleep
- That? What does it leave your nose?
It was for the pain
Were you about taking out it?
Anything works
Will I take charge of this, this well?
Me your small visitor's deharé
Stay this way, lean back
This is as the game "Operating"
- You played the nose
If
You have to be still
It is enormous
My face hurted me so much
I have to clean
Better
How do I see myself?
That it happens? This bad?
Not it is so...
- Oh my God!
- Affection
- It is horrible!
- Affection
We have the credit card
we can fix it
Go away, everything is your blame
As that my blame is?
I made it alone to prove you
that you were mistaken
Now these happy one?
Lilac, is a madness
Lilac goes
It is ridiculous, as much as time
you stayed there
It doesn't concern you, leave alone me
Edduard
Baby, we go, I have to urinate
- And?
- Allow me to enter
See to urinate to another part
Why you won't explore Mexico
or something like that?
Not I want to explore Mexico without you, we go
I want to be alone
We have to eat
Do you want to have breakfast?
It passes the menu for below
of the door
I thought that they would go to the
fishing expedition
With 150 dollars it would rot
to make something, Sr parties
I suppose that it is as well as
the hcen in California hey
Without consideration for those
people's plans
This well, stops to be so weeping
In the morning we walked
for the beach
And we think that there were not us

For their birthday, we will put one
badge in their car that Byoo says
Anything of names,

bus that he/she goes to Miraflores
It is or more good of Mexico
The Uncle Tito will take charge of everything
Tito looks, I need that

Affection, are you your?
Well, I will open the door

You want to know the secret of our
happy marriage? Make that that me
It drives the following mile

of hiring a great company
It is international, alone they have that
to bite the fishhook, I go up them to the boat
And I shake them until death

But first have to leave
Grandiose
Affection, lament to have this way you traado

What were you thinking?
Esque comes here, and you want

...and I do you with another woman
in your honeymoon, I imagined that...
...everything was well for

Lament the malentendido, Mister

He/she listens... I have that... to tell you something
Something that I should say you before
but I didn't make it and...

If, but it is very important that

If, it is good
Your hand
Not I will retard it but...
I have not been a good husband
I have been bad
Me dá so much pleasure that

From the moment in that us

And you transformed into this moonstruck one
If! You are right, I became
a moonstruck one...
...you are not your, I am me, this conversation
it is for my, because...
...as wife, you have made all that that
any man...
...it would be happy of having
a wife as you
And everything to make it for my
with all my... madness
The point is, affection, you don't have
that to give everything for your husband
You deserve something well
- Do you understand what I say?
- If, you apologize, it is very sweet
That is hot
Affection, in the life, sometimes...
...you sometimes choose something and...
...and in retrospective, you realize
that the election is not the correct one
Not a malaeleccion
neither a bad, alone...
...it is not the correct one
For people that are
involved
Of what do you speak to Eddie?
Lilac, we won't be happy together
In San Francisco
It is where you have to be
That is your destination
To clean the rocks and
to prepare the atmosphere
It is what you should make, not to be
in San Francisco with me
- A fool of the sport
- Oh my God
You are saying what I think
that you say?
Lilac, this will be something good
You have something leaving of...
This will be the best thing
Do you listen to me?
- Tngo that to call to mom

Something enormous, Eddie will leave

You should see your face
You were so happy

Not I can believe that
I deceived you again
The comic
It is well, don't worry about my
Seriously, these here for
some reason?
Which the problem is? you love me
that he/she returns with Lilac
Or to return there, it won't pass that
You look at yourself
Listen to you
These "crazy one"
Am I crazy? No, your these lunatic
Lilac burned my lunch,
it burned my clothes, it burned my passport
Although he/she wanted to return it would not rot
Not I will have my papers
in one month or something like that
But you know that, I don't need papers
to walk with this type
Because you don't see papers
Alone you see friendship
Or not?
And we will stay here, and we will speak
a lot, a lot, until it is clear, certain?
Until always, do I have raznon?
He/she listens, foreign magpie...
...you have been I chingando for everything
this time for that shit
Do you want to fix that you made?
he/she stops to speak of that and make it
Get up and make it!
He is right
He/she has to return and
to fix it, ok?
We go, get up, you can make it, we go
He/she looks, I have conecciones, people
that it can take you from return to California
- Not you do joke?
- No, I promise it, I don't enter with that
Well, but I don't want to go
to California
I want to go to Misissipi
Calm, I am American but
I lost my passport
I believe that this is a bad idea
Dad looks, I thank that
you are helping me
This is something that I have to make
Not I understand what it passed with you and Lilac
he/she was such a sweet girl
Dad, master to Miranda
- It had never been but sure in my life
- This well, alone you are careful ok?
He/she remembers, these types have weapons
It is here, hold
I believe that you should wash yourself
to shave or something like that
I have been thinking of this speech
alone I want to enter and to make it
Byuu
That good to see you again
I know it, don't ask
Is Miranda?
- You should be crazy
- No
My God! That he/she makes this idiot here?
- Not I want problems Martin
- No? Now if you are in problems
Shit piece!
That is a very honest answer
Allow me to tell you this,
did I make a great error, ok?
Guilty
I shitted it and I admit it
I married very quick,
I knew my wife two weeks...
...before marrying and that
it is the other face of the currency
And as much as time met Miranda
before deciding that she is the indidcada
Two days, and I knew that...
...that it is my point, I won't make
the same error again
They should be sure, I am completely
in my five senses
And as soon as my marriage finishes
I will tell to Miranda that we go slowly
I say, to leave a time to move
together one year at least
To see like he/she feels and
to leave of there
Without promises
I want to make it well this time
Not there will be a this time" Eddie
the Pop music entered in its head
Miranda marries on Saturday
What?
- Of what haban?
- Finally it has recovered the sense
- I don't believe them
- But it is worth that you believe
- I don't believe you
- Eddie
It is true
He/she will marry
- At least I can speak with her in person?
- No, aéjate of Miranda! Ok?
I will leave the face
I am calmed
We ask you you to respect
Miranda's privacy
Alone they want to be happy
If you care Miranda
it is it you will make
I will make it
I am me
Are you crazy?
It is a madness
What do you make?
They told me that you married
- I only want to speak with you
- Is he my husband you see it?
I will be quiet, alone you listen to me
Not I will listen to you,
this is a madness
I request it to you
Alone Porfavor listens to me
You have one minute, ahead
First, I regret not to have you
said that was married
I was about telling it to you a couple
of times but...
...there was a malentendido for that of
that my wife had been murdered
- The point is...
- The point is that you love me something or not
You were about catching me in
your honeymoon
- Do make it quick if?
- I make it, I want to apologize
But on the other hand
I am glad him to happen
Not it is my blame that it passed this
I shitted it
I married very quick
And now I know that I should not make it
I request it to you
I fell in love with you
And I will never apologize for that reason
Never
Damned he/she is Eddie
It lowers the bat
Not it is for you, it is for him
Who demons is this type?
This psychopath attempts
to steal your wife
He/she knew that you would make, dog son
Not I can avoid it, it is made
what is for what is wanted
Eddie has to leave of here
- Not until you give me an answer
- No! Not there will be answer
Damned! That hurted!
Do you feel very rude?
I will become trained, we go
Don't enter in problems
alone I am of back
The one that this in problems is your
magpie
Dad, is well, Miranda...
...alone you tell me, you feel the same thing or not
We can fix everything
No, it is not this way, Eddie
We had a coneccion in Mexico
But only fué that
I love Kyle and all that happened
in End he/she made me realize that
I regret it
It is everything
We go, larguemonos of here
The dogs are crazy, you know it
Hey dad
He/she looks
He/she is looking at me while I leave
He/she is the better Eddie
We go, man
Not you can leave me now
It was to improve it
What does that mean?
It means that in that I am
I told it to him...
...from now on, of Thursday to Domingo
it will be to be outside of house
It is a lot of time
Did you really say that?
Simply this way
- You put the hand as if...
- If
And she understood
Affection, I am conversing
with Eddie at this time
I call you but it takes, good-bye
- Impressive
- Do you see?
It will be this way from now on
please don't leave
We already happen for this reason, there is not
I motivate to stay here
Lilac, will have the store when getting divorced
and potato...
...it is in Las Vegas the whole time
Not I have known anybody
in the last 6 months
It is because you are always seeing
what Miranda will make
No, I already overcame it, I continue ahead
In fact, it is something good to have
left of that experience
Ah if? As staying with
their underwear for 6 months
Smelling that, it is asombrosoz
If, for that reason I have to change
I cannot wait to that the life changes
I have to follow my instincts
Now my instincts tell me...
Mac, enters to the puto car
at this time
Eddie, take care
How these Eddie
you are sad
