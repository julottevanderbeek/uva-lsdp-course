SOLARlS
Part One
Chris! Come here!
You're just in time.
He takes a walk every morning
for at least an hour.
He has been working too hard,
all night sometimes.
This science of solaristics of his!
He reminds me of a bookkeeper
making up his accounts.
We expected you yesterday.
He wanted to run away
when he saw me.
Hello!
How do you do?
l guess l shouldn't have bothered
you today.
How old we have grown!
l'm only now beginning to realize it.
Everything will depend on his
initial report from the station.
Every message we receive
is confusing or incomprehensible.
lf he confirms for us that
the study shouldn't continue,
the station can be taken out
of Solaris's orbit.
l understand.
You promised to talk to him.
l've brought the film.
Yes, of course.
Would you mind keeping
the boy for a few days?
Anna'll be pleased to have him.
She'll have more free time now.
When does he leave?
By this time tomorrow, he'll already
be gone.
lt's very pleasant here.
This house looks like my grand-
father's house. l liked it very much.
And so we built this one just like it.
l don't care much for new things.
Well, l better get going.
l've an awful lot to do.
Don't you want to see this?
l've already seen it many times.
Twenty-one days after the launch
of our expedition,
radio biologist Vishnyakov
and physicist Fechner
went on an exploration mission over
the Solaris ocean in an air vehicle.
When they failed to return,
we ordered a search.
The fog was too dense,
and we had to call the search off.
All of the rescue craft
returned to the station
except the helicopter
piloted by Burton.
He came back
only after the dark had set in.
He immediately ran to his quarters,
obviously in a state of shock.
lt was so unusual
for a man
who had been flying for 1 1 years.
He had recovered in a couple of days,
but he would never leave the station.
And he refused to approach
the window overlooking the ocean.
While under medical care in a clinic
he offered to make a statement
of great importance,
one which he felt could affect
the whole future of Project Solaris.
Very well, let's hear his story.
Now is the time
to let Burton talk.
The first time l descended
below a thousand feet,
l had trouble maintaining altitude,
because the wind had come up.
All my efforts were required
in operating the ship.
l wasn't watching outside.
As a result, l entered the fog bank.
Was that an ordinary fog?
lt was like nothing l'd ever seen
before.
lt seemed to be a colloidal substance,
a gluey mass.
All the windows were coated.
Because of the fog's resistance
l began to lose altitude.
Where l supposed the sun would be,
the fog glowed like fire.
Half an hour later, l emerged
into a large open space.
The patch was round,
about a few hundred meters across.
At that moment l observed
great changes in the ocean.
The water became still,
and the surface looked transparent.
A sort of yellow mucus started
to congeal under it.
When it rose up,
it glistened like glass.
Then it began to boil,
and a frothy crust appeared on top.
The surface was brown
like burned sugar syrup.
This substance solidified into big
lumps,
giving shape to
all sorts of figures.
l was being drawn to
the fog bank,
so l had to struggle
against this force for some time.
When l looked down again,
l saw a sort of garden.
A garden?
Quiet, please.
l could see vegetation, hedges,
acacia trees, narrow paths.
All of this same substance.
And all these trees and plants,
did they have leaves?
Those bushes, acacias?
They looked like they were made of
plastic, but in real-life proportions.
All of a sudden cracks started
to appear.
The boiling began again,
all was in froth.
You'll be able to see it
for yourselves.
Everything l saw
will be on the film.
Then l suggest
we interrupt the hearing
and look at it
with our own eyes.
Yes, show us the film.
lt's very interesting.
- ls that all?
- Yes, that's all there is.
But we don't understand.
Your film is nothing but clouds!
That must be the fog
l was talking about.
l'm as surprised
as you are.
All this might be the result of
the bio-magnetic current of
the Solaris ocean acting on Burton's
conscience.
We know these currents to be not
only a gigantic cerebral system,
but also to be capable
of generating thought.
That is a hypothesis
that has not been confirmed.
Weren't you ill on that particular
day?
Oh, this next part is pointless.
We'll pick up here.
...l saw something floating.
l thought that it looked like
Fechner's space suit.
l kept circling the spot to make sure
l wouldn't lose sight of it.
Suddenly l could see the form
rise slightly,
as if treading the waters.
l could see the man, he wasn't
wearing a space suit, and he moved.
You mean it was human?
Yes, human.
You saw his face?
Yes.
What man?
Who was he?
lt was an infant.
- Did you recognize it?
- l'd never seen it before.
When l circled nearer,
what l saw was monstrous.
What do you mean?
At first l couldn't make it out,
but then it became clear
that it was incredibly huge.
lt was twelve feet tall.
lts eyes were blue,
its hair was dark.
lf you're not feeling well,
we can recess the hearing.
l will continue.
lt was absolutely naked,
as if new born.
And it was moist, or rather slippery.
lts skin was glistening.
lt rose and fell
with the waves,
but it was moving by itself.
The whole thing was repugnant.
Wait a minute,
there isn't very much more.
...Burton's statements
would appear to be
the expression
of a hallucinatory complex,
induced by atmospheric
influences of the planet,
plus obscure symptoms to which
the brain's cortical substance
contributed in some measure through
the excitation of associated zones.
This report in no way reflects
the actual facts.
Or almost in no way.
There's a different opinion
offered by Professor Messenger
who believes
that the information
supplied by Burton
could be true
and needs to be
thoroughly studied.
l saw everything l described
with my own eyes!
l would dare to venture
another opinion.
We are on the verge
of an immense discovery,
and it would be unwise to be
influenced by the fact that we base
our decision upon the observations
of an unqualified layman.
Every explorer may well envy
this pilot,
his presence of mind,
his talents of observation.
Moreover, given
the recent information,
we are bound morally
to press forward with our probes.
l can understand
how Professor Messenger feels,
however let's look back
at the long road we've traveled.
For all our work, the Solaris probes
are back where we began.
Years of effort
have proven useless.
All we know about Solaris
reminds me of a mountain
of separate facts
which we are unable to squeeze
into the framework of any conception.
Well, we're even worse off today,
as regards the essential.
Solaristics is degenerating.
The essential question is far more
serious than just Solaristics.
We're probing the very frontier
of human knowledge.
By artificially establishing
a knowledge frontier,
we limit our concept of
the infinity of man's knowledge.
And if our movement is not forward,
do we not risk moving backward?
What do you mean by saying
that the information supplied by me
is in no way reflects the actual
facts?
l saw all this with my own eyes.
lt means
that some real phenomena
could have triggered
your hallucinating.
ln windy weather
it's very easy
to mistake a swinging bush
for a living creature.
To say nothing of a strange planet!
There's nothing offending in it
for you.
What action are you going to take
in view of Prof.Messenger's opinion?
Practically none at all.
Our research in this area
will be discontinued.
l have a statement to make.
lt's not my reputation but the spirit
of the expedition that you offend...
Well, et cetera...
lt's considered to be good manners
now
to laugh whenever Burton's report
is mentioned.
We've known you a long time,
but still l know so little about you.
You were very handsome then.
You don't mean that, but thanks
anyway.
Well, Chris, what do you think
about all this?
l would like to speak to your son
alone.
l hate to look like an idiot
before you once more.
l'll wait for you outside
by the swing.
He looks ridiculous, your Burton.
Don't say that.
He's obviously ill at ease.
He feels he's intruding on us.
lf he decided to come, it's because
he considers the matter so important.
l didn't want to see outsiders
today any more than you did.
We don't talk to each other often
enough.
lt's good to hear you say that.
Even on the last day.
The last day...
When the farewells are overdone,
you feel awful afterwards.
Let's meet after dinner.
We need to talk.
And still, why did you invite this
Burton fellow today of all days?
Where are the guests going to sleep?
Upstairs, l guess.
Well, l'll be down by the swing.
- But perhaps...
- Just a second.
The question of where they're
going to sleep can wait!
Listen, Chris...
What's the matter?
What is it down there, standing
in the garage and looking at me?
lt's just a horse.
l've seen it already.
Come on!
He's very gentle.
Look how beautiful he is!
l think that Solaristics
is at an impasse
as a result of
irresponsible fantasizing.
l'm only interested in truth,
but you want to convince me
of your point of view.
l can't draw conclusions
based on ''reasons of heart''.
l'm not a poet.
My problem is simple:
either end the research,
withdrawing the station from orbit
and legalizing the crisis in
Solaristics,
or take extreme measures,
like bombarding the ocean
with high intensity beams.
No, not that!
Didn't you want to continue
the research at any price?
And you want to destroy that which
we aren't capable of understanding?
No, l don't advocate knowledge
at any price.
Knowledge is only valid when
it rests on a foundation of morality.
Man is the only agent
who renders science immoral.
Don't forget Hiroshima.
Then don't make science immoral!
lt's strange...
There's nothing strange about it.
Even you can't be sure that
all you had seen
weren'tjust hallucinations.
Thank you for your time. We have
nothing more to say to each other.
- ls anything the matter?
- l'm leaving.
Leaving?
He is a bookkeeper, not a scientist.
We're friends, Burton, but you
shouldn't say that about him!
We've known each other for 20 years.
lt had to end someday, l guess.
Are you leaving the child?
Why did you have to offend him?
You're heartless.
lt's dangerous to send
your kind to the cosmos.
Everything is far too fragile there!
The earth somehow manages to put up
with men of your sort,
though at what cost to humanity!
Are you jealous of the fact that he
will be the one to bury me, not you?
lt'd been established that the Solaris
ocean is a peculiar kind of brain.
Later, even a more daring hypothesis
was put forward,
that is the Ocean is
a thinking substance.
For years this hypothesis could not
have been substantiated.
This program is about Solaris.
Very few true believers
have remained.
First of all, they are those
who are connected with the station.
On the station for a 85-strong crew,
only three men are still working.
They are astrobiologist Sartorius,
cyberneticist Snout
and physiologist Guibariane
who is dealing with the problem...
l'm calling from the city.
Burton!
Anna, please, we need to talk.
What l talked to Chris about was not
important. l should have told him
about Messenger who had
a different opinion at that meeting.
He got very much interested in
Fechner who died in Solaris Ocean.
lt turned out that Fechner has an
orphaned son, he had left his family.
Messenger and l paid a visit
to Fechner's widow.
l saw this child with my own eyes.
You never told me about that.
- l didn't have a chance.
- All right, what about it?
He looked exactly like the child
l'd seen on Solaris.
Except that he wasn't twelve feet
tall.
lt wouldn't be good for him
to think about it before the launch,
but he should remember this
when he's there.
There's no point in keeping these.
The only ones to be kept
are those in my room.
All my research notes, my thesis...
l wonder why we kept all these?
Should something happens, l'll find
someone to take care of them.
Oh, don't look for the film with
the campfire. l'm taking it with me.
Oh, sure, do that...
- Ready, Kelvin?
- Ready!
You have nothing to worry about.
Have a good trip.
- When is the lift-off?
- You're already under way!
Station Solaris!
Can you do something?
l seem to be losing stability.
Where are you all?
You've got company!
Doctor Snout?
Snout?
l'm Kelvin, psychologist.
lt appears you weren't expecting me.
Did you receive the radiogram?
Yes, certainly.
Why are you so upset?
l'm sorry...
Where is Guibariane?
And Sartorius?
Sartorius is in his quarters.
Guibariane is dead.
Dead?
He committed suicide...
l knew Guibariane. lt's not like
him to...
He was in a state
of profound depression.
Since these mysterious disorders
began...
Maybe you'd better rest, take a bath.
You may take any room.
Come here in an hour.
l'm impatient to meet with
Guibariane... l mean Sartorius.
l doubt if he'll let you in.
He's up in his laboratory.
Listen, l'm aware that something
extraordinary has happened,
and perhaps l...
Doctor Kelvin...
You see...
Please, come in an hour.
Go now, and rest.
Now there're only three of us on
the station: you, me and Sartorius.
You know what we look like
from our photographs.
lf you see anything out of
the ordinary, not me or Sartorius,
try not to lose your head.
- What would l see?
- That depends on you.
- Hallucinations?
- No... but don't forget.
- Forget what?
- That we're not on earth.
Why don't we have our talk tonight?
No, let's make it tomorrow morning!
A. GUlBARlANE
HUMAN BElNG
TO C. KELVlN
Hello, Chris.
l still have a little time left.
There're certain things l must tell
you,
that l must warn you about.
l suppose you've been told
what happened to me.
lf not, Snout or Sartorius
can tell you the details.
What happened to me,
it matters little.
The trouble is that no one can really
explain it.
l'm afraid that what's happened to me
is only a beginning.
l wouldn't wish it, of course,
but it may happen to all of you.
Here, it may happen to anyone,
for sure.
But don't think that l've gone mad.
You know me well.
lf l have enough time, l'll tell you
why l did this.
lf it does happen to you,
you will know it's not madness.
That's the main thing.
As for continuing
our program of research,
l'm of the same opinion
as Sartorius.
Bombard the plasma of the ocean
by high-powered X-rays.
lt's prohibited,
but there's no other choice.
We - or rather you - will be drawn in.
lt may offer a way
to break this deadlock.
lt's your only chance to establish
contact with this monster.
There's no other solution left.
lf you...
Doctor Sartorius, my name is Kelvin.
l arrived two hours ago.
Look, l'm in a ridiculous
situation here.
Either you open up,
or l'll break the door!
All right, l'll open the door, but
don't come in. l'll come out.
My name is Kelvin.
You must have heard of me.
l worked with Guibariane.
Dr. Snout told me about Guibariane...
l can't believe it.
So, you know the story.
Yes, it's horrible. l have no details,
l only know he's dead.
All of us may die.
But he insisted upon being buried
on the earth.
Guibariane wanted to be in
the earth, with the worms.
Have you ever heard of Burton?
Yes, he was on the search party
for Fechner.
Fechner died a magnificent death,
and Guibariane was a coward.
Please... He's dead!
Why judge him?
Duty to the truth is the only concern
that should count.
You are misguided in your search.
Look...
This courage you pretend to
is only inhumanity.
Go away.
You're obviously overemotional.
You must adapt yourself.
Good health to you.
l saw Sartorius and we spoke.
l don't find him very likable.
He's a very talented scientist.
l'm afraid
l don't feel so well.
There's nothing wrong with you,
but you won't listen to advice.
Aside from the three of us, is there
anyone else on the station?
Did you see anything?
What were you warning me against?
What did you see?
A human being? Was she real?
Can she be touched or felt,
or wounded, hurt?
When did you see her the last time,
today?
And you, how do l know
who you are?
Shhh...
- Where did she come from?
- Leave me alone!
You're afraid...
Don't worry, l'm not going
to think you're insane.
Me, insane? Oh God,
you know so little...
Madness would be a blessing!
Snout, listen...
lt's all so absurd.
They don't understand anything.
They're sure that l've gone mad.
Though it's something like insanity,
l've got to do this.
l'm afraid that Snout and Sartorius
will try to force their way in.
They don't understand what they're
doing. l'm frightened, Chris...
l can't...
No one will ever understand...
Guibariane, open the door!
Don't be a fool!
That's us, Snout and Sartorius!
We want to help you!
They say they want to help me.
All right, quit knocking.
l'm my own judge.
Have you seen her?
Try to understand, Chris, l'm not mad.
lt has to do with my conscience.
l really hoped
you'd get here in time.
How did you...
lt's so good!
But you can't possibly... How did
you find out where l was?
What do you mean ''find out''?
Don't, Chris, that tickles.
Where are my shoes?
No... they're not there.
Who's this?
Chris, this is me...
You know...
l have a feeling
as if l've forgotten something.
What's the matter with me?..
Do you love me?
Why do you have to ask, Hari,
as if you didn't know.
l've got to go out.
l won't be long, wait here.
- Can't l come with you?
- No. l'll be back soon.
No!
Why?
l don't know...
l can't...
You can't what?
l feel like l've got to be with you...
all the time, to see you...
Why are you being so childish?
l've work to do, Hari.
You're right, l'm acting childish.
As for you, you're as nervous
as Snout.
- As who?
- As Doctor Snout.
How do you know...
l've got to go.
lf you want, you can come with me.
But you won't be able to get
into a suit with your dress on.
Help me, l can't do it by myself.
Why do you keep staring at me?
Yes, come quickly.O
You might at least knock.W
l thought
l heard you talking to someone.
All the more reason.
So you've had visitors?
You handle that very cleanly.
Well, you won't die from it.
l hope you used moderation
in the beginning.
Narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh?
lf you came here to clown,
you might as well leave.
You're not going to tell me
you haven't tried the rope or hammer?
l don't suppose you threw an inkwell
as Luther did?
You just locked her in,
pressed the button and that's it!
Next time, you mustn't panic.
Try to launch it from the corridor.V
- Do you know what it was?
- No.D
But we've been able to establish
a theory at least.
- Who was it?
- She died ten years ago.
You've just seen the materialization
of the person you think you knew.
- What was her name?
- Hari.
This began after we experimented
with X-rays.
We wanted to test the ocean,
so we initiated a concentrated surface
sweep using high intensity rays.
Yes, but this is...r
You're fortunate. This woman is
only part of your past.
lmagine if you had seen something else,
something unknown in your experience,
out of the recesses of your soul.
l don't see what you mean...
Apparently the ocean somehow
probed our brain centers,
from which it extracted
isolated bits of memory.
- You think she'll come back?
- She will and she won't.
- Hari the second...
- There may be many of her.
- Why didn't you warn me?
- You wouldn't have believed me.t
l got scared and acted not very...t
Don't berate yourself.v
The point is to liquidate the station.s
This is my mission.t
lf l make out the report,
will you sign it?
What if she were the contact
we've been waiting for, for so long?
The night is a blessed time here.
Somehow it reminds me of the earth.
You can also tie strips of paper
to the air vents.r
At night you'll think you're hearing
leaves rustle in the dark.
Guibariane's invention. Like all
strokes of genius, it's so simple.
Sartorius said we were sentimental
fools,
but he has something like that
hidden in his closet.k
Try and get some rest.
We'll meet in the library later.
l've prepared a list of books for you.
Snout, is that you?g
Chris, where are you?
Come here.d
lt's so dark...
Come here, don't be afraid!
The door opens the other way!n
Don't be afraid. l'll be right back.r
When l saw that you weren't there,
l was afraid...c
Hi, Chris!
l can hardly hear you.
What are you doing right now?
Nothing.b
Sartorius wants to see us
in the laboratory.y
Yes, l'll be right with you.
Chris, what's wrong with me?y
ls it epilepsy?d
This is my wife.o
How do you do?d
Hi.g
We've been waiting for you.e
l couldn't get away sooner.t
- Are these yours?
- No, they're Snout's.
As far as l'm able to observe,
they are structured...
Let's call them ''The Visitors''.e
While our structure is atomical,
theirs is based on neutrinos.
But any neutrino system
would lack stability.
There must be a magnetic field out of
Solaris stabilizing them.
You've got an excellent specimen.n
She is my wife!i
My congratulations. l'm delighted.
Take a blood sample
from your ''wife''.a
- Why should l?
- You'll see things a lot clearer.
What do you think, Snout?s
l'm fed up with the lot of you!b
l used acid to burn the blood,
but it regenerates itself.
Self-regeneration?
lmmortality! Faust's problem.a
There's no need of absorbent cotton.n
Are you qualified to perform
an autopsy?l
She's my wife.
Don't you understand?n
lt's more humane to experiment on
them than on the earth rabbits.
lt would be like cutting off
my own leg.t
Did you feel pain
when you broke through the door?
Pain? Of course!o
So if l ever catch you
attempting anything on her...
You're very lucky to have established
an emotional contact with them.
lt may feel pleasant, but...t
- What? Are you envious?
- Perhaps.
No, you can't feel any guilt,
the guilt is mine.
When you have turned yourself
into a hopeless cripple,
you can call on us.
We will empty your chamber pot.
- Toward whom are you guilty?
- Toward you, among others.s
My father shot most of the film.
l shot bits of it.
Do you know...t
l don't even know my own self.
Who am l?
As soon as l close my eyes l can't
recall what my face is like.o
Do you know who you are?t
Yes, all humans do.g
That woman in the white fur coat,
she hated me.
That woman died long ago,
before we ever met.
Stop fooling me.w
l do remember that l came over
for tea,
and she told me to leave the house.n
So l left at once.
l remember it very well.
What happened after that?
After that, l went away. That was
the last time we ever saw each other.
Where did you go?f
To another city.
- Why?
- l was transferred.
Why didn't you take me with you?o
Because you refused to come.
Yes, l remember that.e
Sorry, l thought
you were awake.t
What's up?u
The rate of regeneration has slowed.
For two or three hours we can be rid
of our visitors.
And you've come in the middle of
the night to tell me that?
l'll tell you exactly
why l came.h
We thought that since the oceane
extracts our visitors from us
during our sleep,
it might be in our interest to
communicate to it our waking thoughts.
- Yes, but how?
- By X-rays.t
Perhaps it will get the message and
spare us all these apparitions.
Again your idiotic X-ray theories
about the greatness of science?
We'll modulate the beam
with the brain waves of one of us.
One of us means me, of course?
A transcription of my thoughts?
What if l want her to die,
to disappear?
Give everything back to that...
mass ofjelly?
lt's already invaded my soul.
Chris, we're losing time.
Sartorius has another project.
The annihilator. To destroy
only neutrino systems.
Blackmail?
l convinced him that we should
start with the encephalogram.
And one more thing...
For now, forget all about it.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
You're invited.c
- You're trying to patch it up?
- Yes, l am.
Not so loud, she's sleeping.r
So she knows how to sleep already?
This is going to end badly.
What do you propose then?.
Nothing. So you'll come?
To the library tomorrow?
We'll set up the table.
At least there are no windows there.
ln the meantime let's go
and see Sartorius.
She's sleeping.
Suppose that she follows us?
Try leaving the door unlocked
this time.
What door?
lt's just a mirage.
l'll be right back.
Where are you going?
Forgive me!
Why aren't you sleeping?w
You don't love me.
Stop it.b
- We have to talk.
- About what?h
l don't know where l came from.
Do you know?t
What are you talking about?c
lf you do know, and you can't
tell me, for some reason,
perhaps one day you will, Chris?e
What are you talking about?
l don't understand anything.
You won't tell, you're afraid to.
So l'll have to tell you.l
l'm not Hari.
Hari is dead...w
She took poison.v
And l'm someone else.o
- Who've you been talking to?
- Sartorius told me.t
When? Last night?
lt would've been less painful
if you'd told me yourself.
Oh, my God! What's the difference?
How did you live all that time?o
Were you in love with someone?
Did you ever think of me?f
Sometimes, yes, not always.
Whenever l felt unhappy.l
l think someone is playing a kind
of game with us
And the more they play,i
the worse it will be for you.s
l wish l knew how to help you.
The girl, the other one,
what happened to her?h
We'd quarreled. Toward the end,
we used to quarrel a lot.
l packed my things and left her.r
She made me understand...
She didn't say it in so many words...
When you've lived with a person long
enough, words aren't necessary.
l didn't think it was so serious,n
but then l remembered that l'd
left the laboratory preparationsa
in the fridge, having explained
to her their effect.l
l got scared and wanted to go to her,t
but then l thought she'd understand
that l took her words seriously.
On the third day l did go to her
after all.
She was already dead. There was
an injection mark on her arm.
Like this?e
Why do you think she did that?r
l believe she felt
that l didn't love her anymore.
But l love you.
Chris! l love you so much.t
Go to sleep.n
l don't know how to sleep.
lt seems like sleep, but it's not.
lt's like a sleep within a sleep.
lt doesn't come from inside me.
lt's from far away.t
lt's still a kind of sleep.
l guess our hero
is not going to show up.
- Why?
- Perhaps he's having guests.
Oh, everybody's here!g
You're one and a half hour late.
What is that you're reading?n
This is all rubbish!
Where did l put it...
Where the devil... Here!d
They come at night,u
but a man needs his nights
for sleeping.
That's our problem.
Man has lost the gift of sleep.
You'd better read it. l'm a bit
overexcited.
''Senor, l know only one thing.
When l...n
When l sleep,
l know no fear,
no hope,
no work, no blessing...
equals the shepherd with the king,
and the simple with the wise.
Sound sleep has but one defect -
it smacks too much of death.
Never before, Sancho, have you
pronounced such a gracious speech.''
That's great. Now perhaps you'll
let me inject a few words of my own?
l propose a toast to Snout,e
to his courage,
and his devotion to duty.
Here's to science, and to Snout!e
To science? lt's a fraud!
No one will ever resolve this
problem, neither genius, nor idiot!
We have no ambition
to conquer any cosmos.
We just want to extend Earth
up to the Cosmos's borders.
We don't want any more worlds.
Only a mirror to see our own in.
We try so hard to make contact,
but we're doomed to failure.
We look ridiculous
pursuing a goal we fear
and that we really don't need.
Man needs man!
Let's drink to Guibariane.
ln memory of a man.
Though what he did, was out of fear.m
No, Guibariane was not afraid.f
There are worse things than
being afraid.
He died because he saw no way out.u
He thought that what was happening,
was happening only to him.
All that heart-breaking moaning
is just second-rate Dostoyevsky.
Who do you think you are
to judge us?t
At least l know why l'm here.
Nature created man
so that he might gain knowledge.
ln his march toward the truth,
man is condemned to knowledge.
The rest is of no consequence.
lf you will permit me to inquire,
what exactly are you doing on Solaris?
What a question!d
Except for your tryst with your ex,
nothing here seems to interest you.
Your time is spent
lolling in bed day after day.a
ls that how you understand
your duty?e
You've lost contact with reality.
lf you ask me, you're plain lazy.
Stop it!'
- Let's drink to Guibariane.
- No, to Man!
Are you suggesting
he was not a man?
Stop it, Chris!
We'd better not quarrel.o
After all, today is my birthday.
l think Chris is more logical
than both of you.
ln these inhuman conditions
he alone acted human.
While you two pretend
that it doesn't concern you,
and that your visitors
are just an exterior enemy.a
But your visitors are part of you,
they are your conscience.l
l believe Chris loves me,?
but perhaps he doesn't really,
perhaps he just defends himself.
By me, who is alive, he wants...d
No, that's not the point.
lt doesn't matter why a human loves.
No, it isn't Chris,a
it's you... l hate you all!n
Don't interrupt me.
l'm a woman after all!e
Woman? You're not even a human being.s
Try to understand that, if you're
capable of understanding anything!
Hari doesn't exist! She's dead!g
You're only a reproduction,o
a mechanical repetition of the form!
A copy from a matrix!
Yes, perhaps.
But l...l'm becoming a human being!r
l can feel just as deeply as any
of you.y
l can live without Chris already.,
l... l'm in love with him.
l'm a human being!u
You, why are you so cruel...
Get up, on your feet!
My dear man!,
Nothing is more easy.s
lt's wrong of us to quarrel like this.p
We lose our humanity,
our dignity as humans.i
No, you're very human,
but each one in his own way.h
That's why you're quarrelling.t
l hope l'm not bothering you?e
You're really a good fellow.
Only you look awful!
Actually, l'm worn out.
Could you help me?t
Doesn't a man who'd give up
his life
for some silly damned contact,
for knowing the truth about it,
doesn't he have a right to get drunk
once in a while?t
Certainly he has, absolutely.w
Tell me, do you believe in our
mission?
l'll stay up a while yet.
lt's important we don't sleep.
l'm going to see Faust in his
laboratory.d
Our Faust, Sartorius, is still seeking
his remedy against immortality.
While we...o
Suppose we opened all the windows
and yelled down as loud as we could?
Do you think it would hear?
Only who shall we call to?a
Maybe we should whip him
with birch leaves?d
Or we could even pray to it...o
What's the matter?g
l think l closed the door...
She's alone there.
Go on. l feel a lot better.
The station changes its orbit.
At 1 7 hours there'll be
thirty seconds of weightlessness.
So don't forget.h
Hari!p
Forgive me, darling, l was lost
in my thoughts.
ls anything wrong?
No. No, nothing's wrong.
Everything's all right.
She drank liquid oxygen...
She did it out of desperation.o
lt is going to get worse.e
The more she's with you,
the more human she becomes.
- What are you going to do?
- Wait until she comes back.
And then what?
Leave the station?h
Chris, she can live only here,
on the station.
What else can l do?
l love her.
Love whom? Her?
Or the girl on the rocket?m
She will return. She can
return a hundred times over.
Don't convert the scientific problem
to an insignificant love story.
l had a foreboding
that this would end badly.a
You should help her.a
lt's horrifying, isn't it?
l'll never get used
to these constant resurrections!
ls it me?.
What?.. What?..t
Why? Why?'
No... l'm not...
Not her... Not Hari...t
And you... What if you aren't either...
- Don't talk, Hari.
- l'm not Hari!o
Maybe your appearanceN
is supposed to be a torment,
maybe the ocean sent you.
But you're more to me than
all that science could ever mean!
- Do l look very much like her?
- You may have looked like her.
But now it's you who are real Hari.
Tell me...G
Do l look ugly? Can you look at me?
- Do l disgust you?
- No.
- You're lying!
- Stop it!l
l must be looking disgusting!t
Don't touch me!n
l love you!o
Hari, what can l do?t
Nothing...n
l won't return to earth.
We'll live here,
on the station.a
l'm afraid.t
The ocean's activity is increasing.
Your encephalogram may be the cause.
Whenever we show pity we empty
our souls.
Perhaps that's true.t
Suffering makes life
seem gray and suspicious.
No, l don't believe that...
l will not accept that...
What is not indispensable to life
is in some way harmful to it?
No, that's not true either.
ltjust isn't true!o
Remember Tolstoy's suffering
about the impossibility
of loving the humankind in general?
How much time has passed since?t
l can't figure it out...
Help me.y
Let's suppose l love you.r
Love is something
we can feel,a
but never explain.
One can only explain the idea.
You love that
which you can lose.
Until today, humanity, the world,
had no way to reach love.
There are so few of us!m
Perhaps the reason we're here,u
is to understand, for the first time,
human beings as a reason to love?
He's feverish.l
How did Guibariane really die?
You haven't told me.
l'll tell you, but later..
Guibariane did not die out of fear,
he died out of shame.
The salvation of humanity is
in its shame!
Mama, l...h
l'm two hours late.
l know. How was your trip?
lt was just a bit tiring.
lt was all right.t
lt's running slow again.
l'll set it right.
You have lots of time.r
l don't know what's the matter
with me...b
l have completely forgotten your face.
You don't look well.
Are you happy?n
Happiness is an idea that's obsolete.o
l think that's too bad.d
l feel so alone now.i
Why are you hurting us?.
What have you been waiting for?
You might have telephoned.
You seem to lead
such a strange life.
You're sloppy, you don't take
care of yourself.
How did you get into this state?.
What's this? Wait, l'll be
right back.u
Hari...r
How are you? You feel better now?
Where's Hari?
- What is it?
- There is no more Hari.
''Chris, l'm sorry l had
to deceive you.
There wasn't any other way.
This is the only solution for us both.o
l asked them myself. lt was my
decision.
Do not blame anyone for this. Hari.''
She did it for you.e
Snout, listen...
Calm down, Chris.n
How was it?..h
The annihilator. An explosion of
light, and a breath of wind.
To think that we quarreled so often
those last days.
Snout, why are we being
tortured like this?
We have lost our sense of the Cosmic.
Ancient man had no such problem.
He'd have never asked why...
You remember the myth of Sisyphus?y
Since we sent your encephalogram,u
not a single one of the visitors
has returned.f
Something beyond our understanding
is happening to the ocean.
lslands have begun
to form on the surface.
First there was one,
then others began to appear.
Are you telling me that
we were understood?
Just like that? ln one stroke?
At least we can hope now.p
- How old are you?
- Fifty two.
Have you been here long?
You must have read my background
papers.
After so many years
on the station,d
do you still feel as clearly your
link with the life down below?
l suppose next you'll want to know
what life's all about, eh?
Please, let's not be ironical.
When a man is happy,
the meaning of life
and other themes of eternity
rarely interest him.e
These questions should be asked
at the end of one's life.
We don't know when our life will end,
that's why we're in a hurry.
The happiest people are those
who never bother asking
those cursed questions.
We question life
to seek out some meaning.
Yet to preserve all the simple
human truths we need mysteries.
The mystery of happiness, death,
love.
You may be right.
But try not to think about it.
To think about it is the same
as to know the day of one's death.
Not knowing that date
makes us practically immortal.
Well, anyway, my mission is finished.
And what next?
To return to earth?f
Little by little, everything
will come to normal.
l'll find new interests,
new acquaintances.
But l won't be able to devote
all of myself to them.
And do l have the right to turn down
even an imaginary possibility
of contact with the ocean,
to which my race is trying
to stretch a thread of understanding?
To stay here, among the things
we both touched,t
which still remember our breathing?e
What for?
Just for the hope of her return?
But l have no hope.a
The only thing left for me
is to wait.
Wait for what?
l don't know... A new miracle.
Are you all right now?u
Yes, l feel fine.a
ln my opinion, it's time for you
to return to earth.
ls that your opinion?n
The End
