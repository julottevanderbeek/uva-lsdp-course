Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs
and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people
with their immigration problems.
We're looking for
an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand
that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat
while we talk. I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended
all traveling privileges
on passports issued
by your government.
And our State Department
has revoked the visa
that was going to allow you
to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there
was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members
of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked
in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country
was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia
is under new leadership.
Krakozhia. Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right. I don't think he gets it.
Er... Let me... OK. Look.
Imagine that these potato chips
are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er... So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple. Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents
the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia! OK?
New government.
Revolution. You understand?
All the flights in and out
of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all
borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently
you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers
until the US recognizes your country's
new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum,
refugee status,
temporary protective status,
humanitarian parole,
or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply...
...unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge,
Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK. OK.
Now I go New York City. Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski. I cannot allow you
to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really? It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US
and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through
a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes. Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter
the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form
that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free. Free.
Free to go anywhere you like
in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this
sorted out by tomorrow,
and welcome
to the United States. Almost.
- Thank you.
- OK. All right.
Thanks, Judge.

Come on. Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties
of acting Field Commissioner
until you get approval from Washington.
Really? I don't know what to say.
- Jesus. Richard, is this real?

Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire

No, I haven't been

That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official
the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful
about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about
the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you
for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians
off to asylum hearings,
and call the parents
of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea
to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go. South America

Mr. Thurman.
There's a man walking around
the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir. You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
I love New York...
- I love it!
-  New York
I love New York
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot
get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa
without a passport,
and you cannot get
a new passport without a country.
There's nothing
we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry,
but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department,
but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking,
what gulag he escaped from.
Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash. Tuesday.
Tuesday. I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
Airports are tricky places,
Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can
never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand? It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards
at those doors will leave their posts
and their replacements
are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes. Late five minutes. At 12 o'clock.
Just today. Just this once.
No one is going
to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release. It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him
and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else
can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK. Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right. Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
What's so complicated? Exit, Viktor.
Come on. In a few minutes,
you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure
nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on. All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
You got it. There we go.
He's got to get a running start,
I guess.
Just leave. Just leave.
Leave. Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling? Is he praying?
No. He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he? Where is he?
-  To the left of here.
- No. He was at the door.
-  Just go a little left.

have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.

"Crisis. Crisis in Krakozhia."
Now that heavy fighting has subsided
and both sides have dug in
for the long winter ahead,

may be in doubt for some time to come.
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia
suffer the consequences.

Why do you wait here every day
when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until
your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
Yes. That's a beautiful way to look at
it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner,
I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison

Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him
in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid
of somebody like him.
-  Sorry, buddy.

Started beeping. So, I grab. I come.
We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No. No food. I stuffed.
OK. All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski,
I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way
to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here
that protect aliens
who have a credible fear
of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you,
then the CBP will be forced
to begin Expedited Removal Procedures,
to bring you to an immigration judge
and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts
are so backed up with asylum cases
that the soonest you'd get before
a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice
but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law. You'd be released.
You would be free to wait
in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people
never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go
if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question,
if you give me the correct answer, I can
get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City. Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
-  OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear
of returning to your own country?
No.
OK. Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes. War.
There are men in the streets
with guns. Political persecution.
- Yes. It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows
what could happen.
Innocent people
are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid
to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So? I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens,
afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
-
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights,
fly 27 hours straight
literally around the world,
and now you tell me you're going
to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact
you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
South African Airlines
passenger Sharif Al-Calala,
please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening
to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please. Don't be hurt.
How can I not be? He's married.
One man. Two womens. Crowded.
You want to know
what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex
wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men
the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes. Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er... No, no. I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.

Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.

Yeah, so could you please
go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
OK.
Who is this?
- Who are you?
-  It's no one.
There's no one here for
two weeks. This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think
he's running this job?
-  I go now.
- Go? Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down
before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew,
put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
OK. Just bring it.
-  Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look. The man without a country.
Come on in. Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did. We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording
everything we say. A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK. So you are clean.
- Good. Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But... Friday.
Don't worry about it. We play for
unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed
at what people leave at airports. Come.
I have two nines and two nines.
Four nines. Thank you.
-  Careful.
-  Watch out.
-  We have a question for you.
-  Yeah, we're just curious.
What is in the can?
-  This?
-  We saw the x-ray.
We know there's no nuts in there.
What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys. OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in... Cher?
Yeah. Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
