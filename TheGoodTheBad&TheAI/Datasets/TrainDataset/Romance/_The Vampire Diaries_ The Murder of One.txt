NARRATOR:
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:
FORBES: Someone drove this stake
through his heart.
I'd know if I were killing.
You wear a ring that lets you cheat death.
How many times can you die
before it changes you?
- What are you doing here, Sage?
- I heard Finn was freed from that casket.
He's my one true love.
Esther's planning on killing her family.
She's linked them all together.
Whatever happens to one happens to all.
It's not over, Nik. A white oak tree 300
years after we fled back to the old world.
- That tree could kill us.
- 1912, Salvatore Milling Company...
...chopped down an old white oak tree
used to make the Wickery Bridge.
- We have a weapon.
- Let's go kill some Originals.
Morning, sunshine.
Hey. How's Alaric?
Indecent. But fine.
So then does that mean
there was no issues last night?
Nope. Slept like a baby. Woke up Alaric.
No headlines
about dead Council members.
Then why do I feel like
you're hiding something from me?
Maybe because you're being all paranoid
and control freaky?
What'd you bring me?
Ooh, chocolate muffins.
You know what they say.
The way to a killer's heart
is through his stomach.
They're not for you.
Fine. Keep convincing yourself
you're still mad at me.
But sadly, Ric's gonna have to miss
Elena time today.
You know, lockdown and all.
Just take it, give it to him,
and tell him that I miss him, okay?
- With pleasure.
ELENA: Please.
DAMON:
Have a great day. Thanks for coming by.
Walking down the stairs.
Opening front door...
...and she's gone.
STEFAN: This needs a sharper point.
- Got it.
We have stakes to kill an Original.
Not gonna miss because you can't whittle.
I said, I got it. Stop micromanaging.
If you guys got this under control,
I'm gonna call the sheriff.
- I wanna turn myself in.
- No, you don't.
I have a homicidal alter ego.
Unlike some people in this room...
...I would like to take responsibility
for the people I've killed.
If you wanted to turn yourself in,
you wouldn't be saying it.
You cannot psychoanalyze me.
I killed Caroline's father.
I nearly killed Meredith.
Everything's changed.
You're not turning yourself in.
Bonnie's herbs are working...
...and we have Originals to kill.
His morals get questionable
when he has revenge on the brain.
Klaus needs to die.
We finally have the chance to kill him.
So you are not turning yourself in.
Here's your ring, Ric. Put it on.
That ring is the reason
I've killed people.
DAMON:
It's also the reason you're alive.
You're going vampire hunting, Ric.
Wear it.
CAROLINE:
Alaric Saltzman killed my father?
I can't expect you to be okay with this...
...but these herbs that Bonnie's
giving him, they're healing him...
...and keeping the dark side buried.
Yeah, and that's supposed
to make everything okay?
No, it's not okay. It's horrible,
and I feel horrible about it, but...
He's a victim of something supernatural.
He didn't ask for this.
It just happened to him,
just like Bonnie's mom.
She didn't ask to become a vampire...
...and neither did Stefan or Tyler.
Or me.
Or you.
None of you asked for this.
But who would I be
if I just turned my back on any of you?
Oh, Elena Gilbert.
Savior of the cursed and the damned.
Hey. What's with the cryptic
secret-meeting text?
I don't know.
Stefan just said to meet here.
Where's Bonnie? I texted her too.
Uh, Bonnie's mom bailed on her again.
- So I think we should leave her out.
- What are we doing here?
I found some more white oak.
Long story, wait for the movie.
Hang on. White oak?
You have a weapon that can kill Klaus?
Nope. We all have a weapon.
- Hello, Finn.
- Hello, Niklaus.
- I have nothing to say to you.
KLAUS: Well, I'm not here to chat.
I will ask you one time, though.
Where's our mother?
Gone to find another way
to end our lives.
And when she does,
I will sacrifice myself all over again.
How fortunate that I found you.
I require your assistance.
I have no wish to help you.
Only to see you dead.
Right. You see,
you won't be able to see me dead...
...because if I die, then you die,
so wish unfulfilled.
Bother someone else
with your hollow charms.
Why, when I can bother my big brother?
I need you to accompany me
back to Mystic Falls.
I have a witch who can help undo
Esther's spell that linked us together.
- I have no wish to be unlinked.
- Again with the wishes.
Let me rephrase. You will come back
with me or I will put you back...
...in that coffin
in which you rotted for 900 years.
What happens to one happens to all.
You may not feel
the effects of the dagger...
...but you'd lose your precious Rebekah.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Let's not make this any worse
than it has to be, darling brother.
You're siding with him?
Rebekah, he stored us in boxes.
At least he's not trying
to make us extinct.
What are you gonna do? Kill me?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You've got a death wish.
Fine. Pathetic, but fine.
The thing is I'm not gonna let you
take the rest of us down with you.
STEFAN: Klaus has always been
one step ahead of us.
But now we have the advantage.
We're all armed and they are all linked.
Meaning we only need
to kill one of them.
We need to seize the best opportunity...
...which means we need
to prepare for every opportunity.
Scenario number one.
You get to play Klaus.
- Okay.
- Rebekah is our target.
We'll distract her, catch her off guard.
To do that, we need to keep Klaus
separate and occupied.
- Caroline.
- Why do I always have to be Klaus bait?
He's obsessed with you. But for right
now we need you to play Rebekah.
We use the quarterback to distract her.
Keep her talking.
- How?
- Act interested. She's lonely, desperate.
- Clearly. She slept with you.
DAMON: Mm. Heh.
Beefcake holds bombshell.
I come up from behind her...
...grab her arms like this.
- Ow.
Which gives me time for one shot.
Got it? Good.
So we all have one stake.
We keep it hidden, and we look out
for any opportunity we have.
No last-minute attacks of pity
for any of them.
ELENA:
Don't worry about me.
Not after what happened
to Bonnie's mom.
- Barbie?
- I'm ready.
Anything that will free Tyler
from his sire bond to Klaus.
DAMON: Busboy?
- Do I have a choice?
Good point.
We have 12 stakes.
Twelve shots at killing one Original.
We can do this.
All right. Let's try another scenario.
Elena, grab a crossbow.
Matt, you play Klaus.
Gather your witch.
Let's get his blood and get on with it.
- You can't force me to help you.
- I most likely could...
...but why force when I can persuade?
Hello, Finn.
Sage.
What do you know? True love prevails.
KLAUS:
It does occasionally have its uses.
Easier than torturing him.
I have something to do. What do you
need from me for this spell?
Just your blood and your blessing.
Where are you going?
I have some unfinished business
with Damon Salvatore.
Ask Sage what he did to me...
...then you'll understand
why retribution is in order.
I mean, did you learn nothing
from the moonstone in the soap dish?
Why? Where'd you put yours?
What the hell was that?
Ric?
- Unh.
- Hello, lover.
Bonnie, we're starting
to worry about you. Call me back.
Or call Caroline.
Just call someone, please.
Mr. Saltzman was, like,
the most normal guy in town.
Is it weird that Bonnie's
not returning my calls?
Is it weird that Klaus' brother's
in the middle of Town Square?
That's Finn. I thought he left town.
SAGE: So can you guess
why I dragged you out here?
If memory serves me...
...this is where the natives
used to make sacrifices to their gods.
This statue was built
where we used to rendezvous.
Back when you used to have
to sneak away from your siblings...
...to see your tawdry lady friend.
I assumed after 900 years
you'd moved on.
I took care of myself.
But I never stopped loving you, Finn.
I don't want you to die.
- Hey.
ELENA : Hey. Where are you?
I just got home. Why?
Klaus' brother Finn
is in the town square...
...and he's with some ex-girlfriend
or something.
Ex-girlfriend? Guy's been in a coffin
for the last 900 years.
- Sage. It's gotta be Sage.
- We have an opportunity.
- So how do we do this?
STEFAN: Listen.
Do not do anything, okay?
Sage is very old and very strong.
- You don't stand a chance.
- Then get Damon and get down here.
What the hell happened to you?
- Stefan.
- Rebekah happened.
I think we have a problem.
I found them in the shed.
What kind of monster would trap
a poor defenseless animal?
I gotta admit,
even for me, it's a little kinky.
You pretended
to be interested in me...
...and then you slept with me
so your trampy friend Sage...
...could steal my thoughts.
Ever since then, I've felt
this incessant need to one-up you.
So I've decided to bleed the vervain
from your system.
Ooh.
You wanna compel me
to be your boyfriend?
Actually, I'd rather compel you
to kill your brother. Or Elena.
But since vampires heal,
bleeding you may take a while.
We should probably stick
to the major arteries.
- Hmm.
KLAUS: Well, look what you caught.
If you're trying to bleed him of vervain...
...think it would be easier
to hang him upside down?
I'm capable of inflicting pain,
thank you very much.
Oh, well, excuse me. It's not like
I have any expertise in the matter.
You know, why don't you just leave
me be and go and manage your witch?
Hmm, now, where were we?
Ticktock. I should hear chanting by now.
I'm still studying the unlinking spell.
It's not that easy,
especially under duress.
You've been warned. If you're looking
for a way to send for help...
...I will kill anyone
who comes to your rescue.
This is the spell.
I just don't know if I'm strong enough.
Then you should have
a little more faith in yourself, Bonnie.
Your energy helped my mother link us.
Honestly, I think someone
isn't trying very hard.
Very well.
Kol.
How's the weather up there
in Mile High City?
And how's our friend?
May I see him?
There's Jeremy.
Playing fetch with his new puppy.
Isn't that just the most adorable thing
you've ever seen?
Thank you, Kol.
We'll be in touch.
So, Bonnie...
...about that spell.
Hey.
I hear you had a run-in
with Buffy the vampire.
Yeah, I'll live.
What are you doing here?
Checking up on you...
...in case you're not you.
I'm me.
Well, I guess not-you
would say that too...
...which is why Elena said
you have to drink this.
I hope it tastes better than it smells.
It doesn't.
Mm. That's disgusting.
Well, it's either that or kill people, so...
Elena told me everything.
Caroline...
...I am so sorry.
I don't even know what else I could say.
Right after I turned into a vampire,
I killed someone.
A stranger. I just killed him.
And what's worse is I liked it.
I have blood on my hands too.
You know, we all do.
Yeah, but the blood on my hands
is your father's.
Yeah, it is. And maybe the guy I killed
was someone's father too.
Look.
All I know is I'm no better than you.
So I'm going to take a page
from the Elena Gilbert handbook...
...and choose to believe
that you can be saved.
Okay?
Okay.
Hey. How is he?
Hey. He's just banged up.
Caroline's gonna stay with him,
make sure Alaric stays Alaric.
Matt texted me. Finn is still in the Grill.
We need to plan our next move.
Uh, Rebekah has Damon.
Our next move should be finding him.
No, we need to stay on point.
See an Original, kill an Original.
That's the plan.
That was the plan before Damon's
life was hanging in the balance.
I understand you're concerned
about my brother's life, but if he knew...
...we were talking about missing
a chance to kill these people...
...he would lose his mind.
If the roles were reversed,
he would stop everything to save you.
I know what my brother would want.
What he would want and what we
should do are two different things.
Are you gonna help me with this or not?
Okay. I'll figure it out myself.
What are you doing?
Rebekah will kill you.
Then hurry up and tell me what to do.
Open. Carefully.
Come on, come on.
We have to keep going, Damon.
- I need a minute.
- No, look at me. Look at me.
Don't be an idiot, Elena.
I am not going to leave you.
Damon.
No.
Hey, hey. Drink.
Ugh. You bitch.
It's not fun when someone messes
with your thoughts, is it?
Actually, I was having
a pretty good time in there.
Well, I hope you were nicer to Elena
than you were to me.
Oh, come on.
I couldn't have hurt you that bad.
You didn't think
I really had a thing for you, did you?
I get it. If Klaus bossed me around
for a thousand years...
...I'd probably
be pretty desperate for attention too.
BONNIE: What was that?
- I wouldn't let it bother you, love.
Well, it does bother me. You bother me.
The way you use people
to get what you want. It's not right.
You're being emotional, Bonnie.
I understand that things
have been rough for you.
You know, with your mother
leaving again.
It's very sad.
I can help you find her.
If you want.
I have people who can find people.
I can bring her back to you.
Or, if you choose,
I can just bring parts of her back.
Isn't it obvious that I'm just gonna
continue to hurt the people you love...
...until you do the spell?
Now, I know it's in the Grimoire.
And I know it requires the blood
of my siblings.
So here we are.
Elijah, Rebekah, Kol and Finn.
Where do you want us?
SAGE: You've never had tequila before?
- Mm-mm.
SAGE:
That's embarrassing.
Seriously. I'm embarrassed for you.
On your way to the promised land
FINN: Happy now?
SAGE: Mm-hm. Lime.
Ah. I am truly awed
by the evolution of mankind.
- Hey, Sage.
- Hey, Troy.
I don't know if I can follow
FINN: You know him?
- I turned him.
You turned him. Why?
I'm in enemy territory.
When your brother and sister called...
...I thought I might need a little backup.
You can't trust anyone here.
- Two more tequilas.
- Ha, ha.
- Cool, I'll, uh, let your waitress know.
SAGE: Thanks.
How many people have you turned?
I don't know. A lot.
Don't judge me, Finn, you turned me.
Exactly, Sage. I turned you.
My passion overtook my morals.
My passions overtake my morals
on a daily basis.
It's called living life to the fullest.
Finally.
Oh. Thanks.
- To living life to the fullest.
- To living life.
What the hell?
Vervain.
Finn, the stake.
No!
No.
Finn, no.
REBEKAH:
Aw, leaving so soon?
Sister, be nice.
Thank you, Bonnie.
See you in Physics class.
Oh, my God.
KLAUS:
Yeah, you'll have to excuse the mess.
Apparently Damon hurt her feelings.
DAMON:
Bonnie.
Go on. Help him.
Save the man who turned your mother
into a vampire.
- Just get me out of here.
- Very well.
Hey, how's Alaric?
He'll be okay. I gave him a bottle
of Bonnie's herbs and he went home.
Oh. Did you guys kill Finn? Did it work?
Nothing worked until I see
Klaus' dead body myself.
Oh.
Bonnie. Where have you been?
Klaus has Damon.
Klaus should be dead. They should all
be dead. We just killed Finn.
No. He forced me to do a spell
that unlinked all the siblings.
He's still alive.
Okay, Bonnie, where's Damon?
At Klaus' mansion.
It's bad, Elena.
He threatened Jeremy and my mom.
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.
I'm sorry. I have to go.
I just... I have to go.
No, Bonnie, just...
Stay. I'll call you when it's over.
Stop. Klaus is stronger than you.
We need another plan.
What we need is for Klaus to be dead.
Stefan, stop it. You're acting on anger.
Anger gets things done, Elena.
Or it'll get you killed.
And it'll get Damon killed along with you.
Klaus does not get to survive this.
Not after everything he took from me.
I miss well-adjusted Stefan.
Ding-dong.
I'm not here for you. I'm here for him.
I don't think so.
I had to kill him, Sage.
- Oh. You remember me.
- Unh.
Good. Then you know
I like to go all 10 rounds.
What the hell?
Sage?
SAGE:
Troy, help me.
What is happening to me?
She just died.
So Sage and this Troy guy die
within an hour of Finn.
But why?
Were they bitten by a hybrid or?
Hybrid bites don't look like that.
Maybe Sage was so in love with Finn
she just died of sadness.
No, that doesn't explain Troy.
It's the blood. The bloodline.
It has to be, think about it.
Finn turned Sage. Sage turned Troy.
They're part of the vampire bloodline
that originated with Finn.
Wait, so when an Original dies...
...every vampire turned from
their bloodline dies along with them?
Because that would mean...
If the Originals die, so do all of you.
The entire vampire species
would just be dead.
This was much different in my head.
Klaus. I'm here.
- Let's do this.
- Oh, good, a hero.
What do you want?
I'm here to make a deal.
Stefan, what are you doing?
Eight stakes made of white oak.
The part of Wickery Bridge
that you forgot to burn.
- That's impossible.
- Actually, it's not.
Finn's dead.
You killed my brother?
Damon in exchange for
the last eight weapons that can kill you.
And how do I know
there aren't any more left?
Because there aren't.
Let's be certain, shall we?
Leave.
No.
Go on, leave.
Nik, he's my plaything, not yours.
I said, go home.
Vampire disposal?
Not my strong suit.
- Ugh. Where'd Stefan go?
- Trading the stakes for Damon.
- All of them?
- No, not all of them.
We still have enough to kill three
out of the four of them...
...if we can figure out who to save.
How are we supposed to do that?
I have no idea.
You were turned with Damon's blood...
...and Damon and Stefan
were turned by Katherine.
And we know that Katherine was turned
by a vampire named Rose.
Well, who turned Rose?
We don't know.
But it can only lead back to one Original.
And if the odds are in our favor,
hopefully it won't be Klaus.
So we can still kill him.
Elena.
Even if Klaus didn't create
our bloodline...
...we know for a fact
that he turned one of us.
Oh, my God.
Tyler.
If we kill Klaus, then Tyler will die.
All right, stop. Stop.
Stop, before you hurt yourself. Heh.
Well, I see
that he can finally be compelled.
Now... Ahem.
Minus the stake that's in my brother...
...how many more stakes are out there
that can kill me?
- Eleven.
KLAUS: Eleven. Really.
- So not eight, then.
- You really shouldn't have lied.
- I'll get you the other three.
- Yeah, that'd be nice. Or, since you lied...
...maybe I'll compel
your brother to chew out his tongue.
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?
Do you really have no appreciation
for me?
I have given you someone to hate.
To loathe.
A target for all of your anger
so you don't have to turn it on yourself.
I've given your life purpose,
as your friend.
I mean, I really think
you should be thanking me.
- Enough.
- Unh.
Step down or you both die.
There. Now you only
have to get me the other two.
REBEKAH:
This is ridiculous.
KLAUS:
What are you doing?
I brought him here. I get to release him.
My rules now.
Bring us the stakes and you both live.
Take your brother
as a sign of good faith.
Bring us the stakes. All of them.
Or I'll wage a war
against everyone you love.
I hope I'm being clear.
REBEKAH:
I can't believe Finn is dead.
Good riddance.
He was an embarrassment, Rebekah.
He was still your brother.
Mind your tongue.
Fine. Let's say a prayer for Finn...
...who slept in a box
longer than he lived as a man.
He was a lovesick fool.
He's better off in death.
Is that how you'd speak of me if I died?
You let the Salvatores loose
with stakes that kill us.
So I guess we'll find out soon enough.
Since when did you have a soft spot
for them?
The Salvatores may fight like dogs, but
in the end they would die for each other.
At least they know what family means.
You destroyed ours.
I wanted a family,
they just didn't want me.
And now we're unlinked.
We're no longer responsible for each other.
So are you leaving?
Soon as I get my stakes, I'm gone.
I'm gonna take Elena and use her blood
to create a new family of hybrids.
And if I choose to stay?
Then you're just as pathetic as Finn.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You haven't said much
since you got back home.
I'll be a ball of sunshine
once Damon gets Alaric's stake back.
Promise.
You really scared me today.
You wouldn't have survived if you
went up against Klaus on your own.
You don't have to worry about that.
Why?
Because he's not worth it.
All this time and energy
that I've wasted hating him.
It was for nothing.
It's done. It's over. We lost.
I'm right back where I started.
That's not true.
Yeah, Klaus dragged you through hell,
but you came out the other side.
You beat him by being better than him.
And what'd I lose in the process?
Look, hating Klaus was easy.
It allowed me to ignore everything
that was happening around me.
Everything I let slip away.
Now I have to deal with that.
- Stefan...
- No, no, just admit it.
Admit it to me, Elena.
You don't owe it to me,
but I need to hear you say it.
I can't. Because it's not true, Stefan.
I never stopped loving you.
I know that. I know you didn't.
Even though I did everything possible
to push you away.
It's my fault.
- It's all my fault. This is all my fault.
- What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the fact
that you're also in love with Damon.
What?
No, Stefan, I was just...
Hey. I love you.
I will always love you.
I just want you to look me in the eye
and tell me...
...that you don't feel something for him.
I don't know what I feel.
- Ah. You're still alive.
- Yeah, for now.
I need your stake.
It's right behind these books here.
A bookshelf, really?
At least I was trying to be clever about it.
Where the hell is it?
Ha.
- Look harder, Ric.
- It's not here, Damon.
Maybe you just forgot
which shelf you put it on.
I didn't forget. I put it right here.
A stake doesn't just vanish into thin air.
- Who else did you tell, Ric?
- I didn't tell anybody. I'm the only...
What?
I'm the only one who knew about it,
Damon.
No.
You telling me
your vampire-hating alter ego...
...has a stake that could kill an entire
line of vampires, possibly mine?
That's exactly what I'm telling you.
