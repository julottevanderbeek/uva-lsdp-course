I swear to God
I had nothing to do
with this.
We would love
to believe you, Mr. Stevens,
but you have to admit...
your version of events
does sound pretty bizarre,
don't you think?
Look. It was a setup, okay?
The whole thing was staged.
So you were framed.
That's your claim?
You were the victim.
Well, I mean, you know,
not-- not like--
Not like who?
Not like her?
Please, just talk to
the other guys. Have you
talked to the others yet?
We're doing our jobs.
So why don't you
just do yourself a favor
and confess?
Save some time,
save some legal fees.
Come on.
Why don't you take us through
the events of this morning?
Again?
Again, Mr. Stevens.
Where were you this morning,
Mr. Stevens?
I was at home, alone.
My wife's taken the kids
skiing.
Actually your wife's
on her way back,
as we speak.
Apparently, she has, uh,
quite a few questions
of her own.
So the phone
woke you around
what time this morning?
I don't know.
Uh, 9:00, 9:30.
It was Luke in a panic.
He said I had to come.
Where were you supposed to go?
To the loft. He told me
to come to the loft.
Did he say
why he was panicking?
- No.
- Did you know why
he was panicking?
No, not yet.
Luke.
Luke?
Oh, my God.
Oh, fuck.
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
What do you mean?
You just-- What, you--
I walked in,
she was lying there.
Oh, fuck.
- Have you called the others?
- Chris and Marty are on
their way.
I-- I still
haven't reached Philip.
Okay, well, uh, keep calling.
We need everybody here.
Do you know who she is?
Vincent, do you know
who's lying there?
What?
No, of course not.
How the fuck did they get in?
Was it a window, a door or--
Windows are sealed,
the door was locked, and
the alarm was turned off.
That's impossible.
I'm telling you,
the door was locked.
And the alarm was turned off.
But that would mean that--
Someone got in
with one of our keys.
Do you know
the loft building...
at the corner of Second
and South Hope, Mr. Seacord?
No.
The new residential one
by the Sports Arena?
Designed, I believe,
by your good friend
Vincent Stevens.
Vincent runs a very large firm.
He's done a lot of buildings.
There's a loft on the ninth
floor, Mr. Seacord.
Have you ever been there?
No.
Strange, because according
to our information,
you and four friends are
sharing this loft secretly,
without your wives' knowledge.
That is ridiculous.
Don't the five of you
bring women up there?
Girlfriends, mistresses,
one-night stands,
catch of the day.
Five pals just looking
for privacy and fun...
without the hassle of
Visa statements and hotel
bills the missus might find.
That is preposterous.
Maybe, Mr. Seacord,
but one of your friends
already made a full confession.
You want to know who?
Listen, I don't do things
like that. You know?
Fool around
with other women. I--
You love your wife.
I love my wife, yes.
What happened to your face,
Mr. Seacord?
- I walked into a door.
- Or were you in a fight?
- I said I walked into a door.
- Where were you this morning?
Out with Chris,
having breakfast.
There will be a lot of people
in the restaurant
to verify that.
By Chris, you mean
Dr. Chris Vanowen,
the psychiatrist?
- That's right.
- One of your loft buddies?
Chris is married.
He's got two kids.
And he's not a guy
who cheats on his wife either.
We've got a serious
fuckin' problem, Chris.
Oh, shit.
Philip.
Philip?
You think your brother
has something to do
with this?
No. We gotta call the cops.
You realize what'll happen
if we call the cops?
- Think about our wives.
- There's a dead woman here,
Vincent.
Why do we think Philip
is involved?
- Chris, you know
what he's capable of.
- Yeah, I know.
Maybe we can help him, okay?
If we can just figure out
what the fuck happened,
maybe we could--
What? We gonna dump
the body somewhere?
Look, I don't fucking know,
but I'm not taking the fall
for this!
Marty.
Son of a bitch.
Have you seen Phil?
Do you know where he is?
Was he here last night?
This can't be real.
No. Wait,
what are you doing?
I want to see her.
Just put her back.
- Goddamn it.
-  Who is she?
I don't know.
Look, none of us has anything
to do with this, right?
Right?
We're gonna find out
what happened here, and we
will figure a way out.
We're in this together.
We'll get out of it together.
Okay?
'Cause we're friends.
Agreed?
Agreed?
Well, it looks like
they'll let anybody in, right?
Congratulations, man.
Thanks.
- This one's really
spectacular, very special.
- I appreciate that.
Ally, it's been too long.
You look terrific.
Thank you.
So, uh, what do you think?
Well, it's bold and focused,
as always.
- I like it.
- Great. You made it.
Hi.
Hi.
- Hi, Barbara. How are you?
- Want to buy yourselves
a little condo?
I think Vincent's little condos
are a little out of our league.
Right. You and your puny
psychiatrist's salary.
You guys grab a drink
and we'll catch up
with you later.
All right.
Congrats, bud.
Thanks, man.
One hour tops,
and then we're
out of here.
Come on, hon.
We just got here.
Man, check out
all these babes. So hot!
It's like
they're in violation
of the fuckin' fire code.
Marty, calm down. I see them.
I can also see Mimi, your wife.
Okay, save me, help me,
protect me.
What's up, Tubs?
Having too much fun?
Nope. Just checkin' out
the hipster crowd
with my pal Luke.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, if you
embarrass me, I'll leave
you here all by yourself.
Oh, don't raise my hopes
only to dash them.
Hi, Luke.
Where's Ellie?
She was just feeling dizzy.
Ducked out to check
her blood sugar.
Hi, Elle.
Do you feel okay?
Oh, I started to feel
not so great before,
but I'm better now.
We can always go home,
sweetie.
Did you hear that? "Sweetie."
After she just checked
her blood sugar.
That's funny.
That's really good.
I would love to see
you deal with something
like that if that was me.
Oh, you know, baby.
I'd love to stick you
in the ass every day.
How many times
have I asked?
Honey?
Lots.
Not now.
You're the shrink,
aren't you?
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Chris Vanowen.
Dr. Vanowen. That's right.
Yes, I remember.
Do we know each other?
No. You knew my sister.
She was a patient of yours
actually. Sophie?
Sophie Morris?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Some people
are just born unhappy.
I'm sorry.
Are you buying an apartment?
What? Um, no. No, no.
I'm friends
with the architect.
Oh.
Are you?
No. No, I'm here with,
uh, Joel Kotkin,
the city councilman.
I work for him as sort
of a personal assistant.
Oh.
I'm Anne. Anne Morris.
Very nice to meet you, Anne.
And listen,
about your sister--
It's okay.
You couldn't have saved her.
Her mood disorder kind
of runs in the family,
unfortunately, so--
Well, you're not thinking
of doing something stupid,
are you, Anne?
Me? You mean like falling
for the wrong man?
Well, I do that all the time.
Everything's all right!
Come on. Keep partying.
- What are you doing?
- Phil, I should've guessed.
Hey, Vince. What's up?
Hey. How are you?
Thanks for comin'.
I'm sorry about this.
She slipped.
No worries.
As long as you're okay.
You all right?
I'm fine.
She's fine.
Let me introduce you to
uh, a colleague who works
with me at the office.
And this one works with me
down at the office.
Or is it the other
way around?
Philip.
Oh, my big brother.
How you doin', man?
Friends of Vicky's?
Bridesmaids?
Come on, man.
I'm still single.
What are you doing?
It's not like I don't
love my little Vicky.
I love her madly.
You know that.
All right?
It's not like I hate
all the other women
in the world.
- All right. Relax.
- There's something
I want to show you.
Let's go get
Marty and Luke.
Chris.
Gentlemen,
welcome to the loft.
Wow. This is impressive,
Vince.
Check out the view.
Then imagine this is
our own private oasis right
in the heart of downtown.
- What do you mean?
- A place where
no one hassles you.
A place you can escape to
any time you want.
- So this is your loft?
- No.
It's ours.
If you want it.
What?
Ours?
Think about it.
No messy hotel bills.
No questionable credit card
activity.
This would be
our secret place...
to steal away, discreetly
and economically...
in these challenging times.
Five-way split.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I'm not like that.
Come on, Chris. We're men.
We're all a little
like that.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Give me your key right now.
Bring your twins up here,
give 'em a little private tour.
- You know what they cost?
- How much? I might have it
on me right now.
Seriously.
Think about it.
It's a great investment.
A once-in-a-lifetime
golden opportunity.
- I can't stay here.
- Where are you going?
- Luke!
- You cannot freak out
right now.
We have to stay together
like we said.
All right. Luke, you need
to calm the fuck down.
No! No! It's over, Vincent!
It's all gonna come out!
It's not over. Listen.
We're gonna find out what
happened here and fix it. Okay?
Try Phil again.
This is Philip.
Please leave a message
after the tone.
What if he doesn't show?
He could be out
of the country by now.
He'll show.
We can't cover for him, Chris.
Not this time.
Guys? Look at this.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
You know Latin, Doctor?
Excuse me?
Latin. Do you know Latin?
I took it premed, yeah.
What's it say
on the wall there?
Fatum nos iungebit.
Yeah, I know.
Fatum nos iungebit.
I can read that.
What's it mean?
I'm guessing you already
know what it means.
No. We would like
to hear you say it.
You'd like to hear me say it.
Okay. Fatum nos iungebit.
Fate will unite us.
Now, all I can possibly
think is that somebody
who knows Latin like you...
reached over
with this young lady's hand...
and wrote "Fatum nos iungebit"
on the wall.
"Fatum nos iungebit"
is wrong.
How so, Doctor?
The future imperfect tense
of the verb unite, iungere...
is not iungebit,
it's iunget.
It should say
"Fatum nos iunget."
So the person
you're looking for made
a classic Latin error.
But I'm guessing
you knew that already too,
didn't you?
You know the phrase "Fuck you"?
Germanic origin.
- Where's your brother?
- I'm sorry. I can't help you
with that one.
Right. Actually,
he's your half-brother,
isn't he?
Same mother,
different fathers.
He spent some time
in various institutions
with your half-sister Zoe?
Yeah, that's right.
After our mother died,
Philip wasn't--
wasn't as lucky
with his father.
Apparently not.
Alcoholic child beater.
You didn't spend much time
with Philip back then, did you?
- No.
- But now you're
best friends.
We've had a lot
of catching up to do.
You really don't know
where we can find him?
Fate will unite us?
Where the hell's
your brother, Chris?
I don't know.
What the hell is this?
- Where the fuck is Philip?
- I'm right here.
- What the hell's going on?
- You did this.
- You did this!
- Luke! Luke, Luke!
- Luke! Come here! Hey! Hey!
- Hands off! Come on.
Bring it on!
- Cool it.
- What is this?
- Luke.
- Shit.
- Did you have anything
to do with this?
- What you talkin' about?
- Just answer the fucking
question! Did you do this?
- Of course not!
- Jesus Christ.
Were you here last night?
No, man, I wasn't here
last night.
I slept at my in-laws.
You don't believe me,
call Vicky.
What about this morning?
Were you here this morning?
I was at a project site,
all right?
With my father-in-law.
My God.
Where were you last night?
- Where've you been?
- Philip, take it easy.
Before accusing everyone else,
where have you been?
'Cause I never got a text
saying the loft was taken.
Never.
- Last night, I was at home.
- Can you prove it?
No, I can't prove it 'cause
Barbara's taken the kids
skiing.
- You'll have to
take my word for it.
- Your word?
There's a dead woman
in our loft that only us
have access to.
Now, if anybody has anything
to do with this, now's the time
to say it, right now.
Thank you for coming.
Philip's got
a ball and chain now.
Who would have thunk it?
Who's the father-in-law
again?
His name's Hiram Fry.
He's a huge property developer.
His friends call him
"the man of steel."
Worth millions.
Think she's his only daughter.
So what's not to love?
I just hope Philip
will be happy.
Hi, you!
- Well, that's cozy.
- What?
Ever since Councilman Kotkin
got elected,
the man of steel's been busy
rebuilding downtown.
Kotkin came to
your opening, right?
Yeah, he turned up
for a photo op.
When it comes to handing out
permits and contracts though,
the game's rigged.
Tell me what we're talking
about again 'cause I just saw
some mini cheesecakes.
Gorgeous, huh?
I mean,
this whole setup.
Whoever said money
can't buy happiness sure
hasn't lived this life.
Sorry, boys.
You lost your bachelor mascot.
He's all mine now.
Good luck with breaking
this bronco, Vicky.
God knows others have tried.
- But I'm not others,
am I, Philip?
- She told you!
It's not just me.
Philip's married into
the Fry family now.
Soon as we're
back from Fiji.
Yeah. Well, gonna
sell some properties
with Vicky's dad.
You know,
see how it grabs me.
Wow.
Grabs you.
Well, guys,
thanks for coming.
Congratulations.
Come on.
I'll be with you in a second,
baby. I need a break
from all the ass-kissing.
Shit.
Where is Fiji?
I don't know, man.
You look gorgeous!
Phil?
Your wedding present.
- Are you for real?
- Absolutely. Don't lose it.
There's only five of these
in existence.
Accepting a key to the loft
means you accept the rules
to the loft. Marty?
Wow.
What, are you crazy?
Our wives are here.
Don't you think that's
a bit cynical, handing
those things out here?
Cynical?
It's just a key to a room.
You should check it out.
Oh, no,
you're not like that.
Not now. Maybe later.
What about you, Luke?
Now or later?
Come on.
That-a-boy.
Oh, wow.
You just make sure
this doesn't blow up
in your faces.
How's it gonna blow up
in our face? It's just a room,
like Vince said. Our room.
Now, we keep it to ourselves,
all right?
Tell nobody.
It just stays within
our circle. Marty?
Yeah?
Yeah.
You just need to find someone
willing to go with you, Marty.
Oh, yeah? Yeah, yeah.
I think there's, uh,
plenty choices right here.
Some of these guys
bring some premium-grade
high-test pussy.
Like that little
dewy-eyed vixen right there.
- She looks underage.
- No, she's 20.
One of you guys
messes with her, I'm gonna
crack your head wide open.
What, do you got dibs
on Miss Curly Locks?
Listen, man.
That's Zoe, all right?
Zoe?
Yeah.
Like as in skin-and-bones
tomboy Zoe?
-  Yeah.
- Oh!
I hate to say it, Phil,
but your little sister's
seriously hot.
Thanks, man.
She's not little anymore.
- That is the finest
piece of ass--
- Marty, that's enough.
I'm just saying,
I'd like to fuck her
like an animal.
- Come on, Marty.
That's enough.
- Feel her from the inside.
I want to fuck you
like an animal
You don't sing.
You don't laugh.
You don't talk about
my sister. Got it?
- Got it?
- Ow!
Don't fuck with me!
You watch it.
You watch it. Kick your ass
at your own fucking wedding.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We met at the, uh--
the building opening.
That's right.
You're Anne Morris.
I'm glad you
remember me, Chris.
Hmm.
I see you work weekends.
What a dedicated
personal assistant.
What a lucky city councilman.
Screw him.
Do you?
Does it get a bit boring
walking around all these
parties by yourself?
He wants you close,
but not too close.
Not when there's
important people around.
I told you I fall
for the wrong men.
Can you keep a secret?
Our city councilman...
likes to keep my panties
with him at these events,
in his pocket.
It's a turn-on for him--
the thought of me
in a crowd so naked.
Only he knows.
Why do you let him
use you like that?
Who says he's using me?
Maybe it turns me on.
Maybe me telling you about it
turns me on even more.
I hope you
don't catch cold.
Chris.
Chris, I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Maybe I was testing you.
I don't need to be tested.
Listen, do you want to
maybe get a cup of coffee...
someplace quiet... private?
I'd like to use your key.
Just once.
It's not what you think.
Hey, it doesn't matter
what I think.
Have fun.
- Does everyone
still have a key?
- Course we do.
It's crucial
we get this right.
Five keys were cut.
To make a sixth, you'd need
the code, which is in my safe,
so we can rule that out.
But there was no break-in.
So does everyone still
have a key?
What, you think we've been
givin' away our keys?
It's against
your rules, Vince.
Then show me.
What are we trying
to prove here?
Look, I don't know.
Maybe someone's lost
a key, okay?
Let's just rule that out.
Okay? Look. Here's mine.
All right?
Chris?
- You didn't use a key
to get in just now.
-
- No. I didn't bring it.
- Where is it?
I don't have it on me. It's
not like I need it every day,
like some of you guys.
But you do still have it?
Vincent, whether or not
I have my key on me right now
is really not important.
It's extremely
fuckin' important.
Someone got in using a key,
and yours is missing!
Is that right, Vincent?
Then how do you account
for the fact that the alarm
was shut off?
So let's just cut the bullshit,
'cause it definitely had to be
one of us five.
Unless--
Unless what?
Unless she let him in.
Oh, yeah?
Then how'd she get in, Vincent?
Any way you look at it,
it keeps coming back down
to us.
And I, for one,
would like to know
who's hiding something.
Where did you learn that?
I seriously don't believe it.
There's a word for that?
Yes. Polyamory.
It's a philosophy,
some sort of belief system...
about being romantically
involved with more than
one person at the same time.
Uh-huh. And your boss
gets away with that?
Yes. He says that
he's in love with his wife
and his girlfriend,
so why should
he have to choose?
- And his wife is
amazingly cool with it.
- Oh, really?
Is she special needs?
Maybe oxygen-deprived? What?
- Explain. I'd like to know.
- This sounds like my kinda
philosophy.
Barbara,
what's it called again?
Polly and Marie?
Please. Spare us, Tubs.
You can barely handle
one woman.
What would you do
with two?
Mmm. Bury one.
I would make up something,
some sort of game...
that involves two ladies
and one guy.
Start a trapeze act
or somethin'.
Could you at least
fake some enthusiasm?
It's your party.
Anyway, I'm cooking.
If you absolutely have to
invite your friends over,
could you at least try
to make it home on time?
Look, they're never here, okay?
Will you just join us?
I just hope the pudgy clown
doesn't puke on the rug.
He's been chugging vodka
like it's Evian.
I mean,
doesn't his wife see that?
Actually, she was just
cool with it long enough
to catch him in the act.
She hired a detective.
Cell phone records,
credit card receipts.
Audio, video, the works.
And in a heartbeat,
my poor boss went from
polyamory to alimony.
Oh.
Man, your boss sounds
mentally retarded.
So, what--
what happened to him?
Oh. Uh, he and his concubine
are now cramped in
a tiny one-bedroom condo.
But I'm guessing he's happy.
She's blonde, 23,
with a brand-new pair
of fake breasts.
Oh! How can men
stand fake breasts?
Ah! Why are women always
talking about "fake tits"
this, "fake tits" that?
I mean, listen.
Girls,
if it's a decent boob job,
who fuckin' cares. You know?
My mom-- My mom,
she's got, uh, false teeth.
Okay? When she smiles,
do people give her shit
and say,
"Oh, my God! Look! Fake!"
No, they don't.
They say, "Wow!
You look way better now.
It's an improvement."
You know, you women,
you're so catty,
so competitive.
Calm down, Tubby dearest.
You know what?
No, it's nothin' to be
calm about, Mimi.
I mean, a glorious,
big set of fuckin' tits...
and a nice piece of ass,
it's-it's thrilling!
It's thrilling!
This is all a little
too highbrow for my teeny,
tiny, catty female mind.
Oh, well, you know what?
You should have that enlarged.
Huh? And while you're under,
you should have the corners
of your mouth lifted...
so you can smile
every once in a while.
Sorry. Sorry, Chris.
What? What?
Marty. Marty.
- Come on.
- No.
No, you're a class act, Marty.
Mimi, would you like to get
your husband another drink
or should I do the honors?
You should do it.
And I want it chilled.
- And then you go
with her and stir.
- Honey?
The problem with your boss,
Barbara,
is he didn't
have his shit together.
I mean, apart.
Apart, I mean.
He did-- No, I mean
he didn't compartmentalize.
You guys agree?
All right, Marty.
How would you compartmentalize?
How? Okay.
Well, since you ask.
First thing first is
I wouldn't have a place
that you could get caught.
Not a hotel,
not your girlfriend's crib.
That's key, right?
Am I right, Vinnie boy?
Am I right?
Marty,
you've lost us all.
I doubt that!
I doubt that, Vinnie boy.
But it-- Okay, first of all--
Sorry, baby.
I would just get
a little-- you know,
a little one-bedroom condo...
or something like that.
- Whoa, whoa!
- Goddamn it!
Oh. You all right?
Mimi, your husband
tends to talk out of his ass
when he's been drinking. Yeah?
All right. There we go.
Hon, would you
give me a hand?
Sure.
- Sorry. Didn't know
you were in here.
- Yeah, no problem.
Ate too much too fast,
I guess.
Thai food, you know.
Yeah, it gets
all up in your nose
and shit.
- Yeah. It's a little spicy.
- Yeah.
I'm outta here. Bye.
- I need to pick up
some more insulin.
- Luke?
Is there something
you wanna tell me?
Are you keeping secrets?
What kind of secrets?
Is there someone else?
I don't know why you start
asking me silly questions,
but the answer is no.
I'm not cheating on you,
Ellie.
That's not what
I'm asking, Luke.
I'm asking if
there's someone else.
Listen, sweetie.
Whatever I may be
or may not be--
and I know I'm not
as glamorous as some--
but I'll always
be there for you
and the children.
I don't know
what I'd do without you.
I want you to know...
there's a lot
I could put up with.
What are you doing?
We need to get her
out of here.
How? She is shackled
to the bed!
Can't you guys
see what's going on?
Someone is
trying to frame us.
Who?
Who wants to frame us?
I don't know.
But think about it.
The body's cuffed to the bed.
It's impossible to move.
The Latin, the knife. Someone
did this for a reason. The cops
could be here any second.
None of us
know who this girl is.
We don't even know
how she got in here.
Who else knew about
the arrangement? Who else
knows about our arrangement?
Did anyone blab,
tell one of the girls
that have been up here?
Marty?
What? Why me?
- Some night you were hammered?
- I've always followed
the rules, Vincent.
Did you give anyone your code?
Did you key in while someone
was watching?
Absolutely not.
I just told you.
Wait.
What's your point, Vincent?
Where are you going with this?
- Someone is
trying to set us up.
- Like who?
I don't know.
A rejected girlfriend.
A jealous boyfriend.
Betrayed husband.
Someone with a motive.
Look. Is one of you guys
in some kind of trouble?
I think I may be
falling in love with you.
You don't have to say that.
No, but I mean it.
Why would you say that, Chris?
Why would you even feel it?
I've never cheated
on my wife before.
And I don't
fall in love easily.
Chris, I don't want
you to love me.
You don't even know me...
apart from these
stolen moments.
I mean, they're exciting,
yeah, sure, but...
they're just moments.
Let's change that.
I wanna see you more often--
Chris, please.
- and not just for this.
- No, stop it.
I don't want you
to love me.
Well, I don't wanna
keep sneaking around.
I'm gonna tell
Alison about us.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am. Anne.
I'm gonna leave her.
Stop it!
Why are you doing this?
The people you love,
they're the only ones
who can hurt you.
I would never
hurt you, Anne.
Stop.
Stop what? I don't know
what you're talking about.
Would you--
Stop it, okay?
You don't know me.
That's the end of it. No.
- Would you give me
a chance, at least--
- I'm a whore.
All right?
What?
I'm a prostitute.
I fuck men for money.
Do you get it now?
Don't worry, Doctor.
I won't bill you
for the past few months.
Please, Anne, would you wait?
Would you wait a minute?
Chris, please stop it.
You don't know the half
of it. Just go home.
Go home to your wife
and your kids.
Is your friend Chris Vanowen
cheating on his wife,
Mr. Landry?
Oh, I doubt that. Chris
is a very devoted husband
and, um--
And a model dad, just like
all the rest of your pals,
right?
Except for you.
You're not exactly
squeaky clean, are you, Marty?
Um, I don't know
what you mean.
- Why does your wife
want a divorce?
- Divorce? That's not right.
What we're going through
is a separation.
It's a trial separation.
Why?
Because she found out
something that she, uh,
wasn't too happy about.
- You fucked around on her.
- If you wanna be technical.
How'd she find out?
- The woman with whom I--
- Fucked around?
Yeah.
Apparently expected something
a little more, and she showed
up on our front porch.
The bitch started to--
The woman in question
started saying things.
And my only hope is that Mimi
will come around eventually,
because I love her very much.
Did you go with this woman
up to the loft?
What? No.
This happened in San Diego.
Oh, that's where you
met the woman, right?
In San Diego.
- Yeah.
- Why were you there?
A commercial real estate
convention. Vince had
a couple extra tickets.
A VIP thing, you know.
It's a couple nights
in a fancy hotel and a chance
to get away for a couple days.
And nights.
Yeah. Nights too.
Man, do you see that?
Jesus, Vince. Those girls
are drooling all over you.
Invite 'em over.
You got first dibs.
I'm happy with second best too.
He's cute.
See him?
I'll take a rain check on that.
What? What, are you
fucking crazy? Why wouldn't
you invite them over?
'Cause, Marty,
I'd rather dive for some rare
and exotic sea creature...
than shoot fish in a barrel.
Does Barbara know about
these deep-sea expeditions
of yours?
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah. What's your problem,
Seacord?
You got a key to the loft.
What do you do up there,
your laundry? Dishes?
Hey, are you guys here
on business or what?
I'm Dana.
My first time here.
It's a little overpriced
for what you get,
don't you think?
Hi, Dana. I'm Vincent.
This is, uh, Marty, Luke.
Can we, uh,
buy you a drink?
Hey, when I said "overpriced,"
I wasn't trolling for
free booze.
- No, I mean, I didn't think--
- Since you asked,
what are you drinking?
Oh, champagne?
A girl can dream.
- Champagne?
- Please.
All right.
One champagne coming up.
What are you doing?
The fat chick's gonna scare
off all the hot chicks.
Marty. Every fat chick
has a good-looking friend.
Hers is probably
on her way down right now.
Okay. Yeah,
well, what if she
is the good-looking friend...
and the really fat chick's
on her way down?
I think that's
Philip's father-in-law.
-
Oh. Yeah, it is.
- I'll be.
That's the man of steel,
all right.
But that ain't Mrs. Steel.
Think we should give him a key?
Maybe. Not mine.
I'd like a bottle
of your finest champagne
and four glasses, please,
at the table in the corner.
You, uh,
were at my daughter's wedding.
Philip's friends.
You're the architect.
Vincent Stevens.
We should talk sometime,
Mr. Stevens.
Sure. What do you
got in mind, Mr. Fry?
We have a new waterfront
project. It's massive.
It's cutting-edge.
It might be
right up your alley.
Of course, it's all
preliminary, and we have to
keep it under wraps.
I hope you can be discreet.
Sure.
Discretion, Mr. Stevens.
That's the main thing.
Dictum sapienti sat est.
A word to the wise.
You are wise?
Yeah, sure. Wise--
Wise and discreet, Mr. Fry.
I'm in software.
I can be discreet myself,
and wise.
I'll pick up their tab
as well.
Uh, have a nice evening,
gentlemen.
Fantastic.
Oh, they're right over here.
Sweetheart?
Sweetheart?
Excuse me.
Hi, this is Anne.
Leave a message.
Who are you
calling at this hour?
I wasn't.
I was just checkin'
my voice mail.
And what does
your voice mail say?
That you're a lousy liar,
Chris Vanowen?
What are you talk--
Is something wrong?
You tell me, Chris.
- Alison, I--
- I'm going to bed.
Alison!
Excuse me.
That's not thinking.
It's called following
your dick around.
Okay, two kinds
of articles in Cosmo
month after month--
One: men are pigs.
Two: How do I seduce
a pig to chop my wood?
I don't read Cosmo
month after month.
Well, I do.
I don't.
Well, I do.
And I find it
strangely compelling.
You know what I find
strangely compelling?
What?
Your eyebrows.
Lumberjack contest.
Oh.
I can't leave you
alone for a minute.
Sarah.
It's been more like an hour.
Thank God I've been subsidized.
Aren't you going to
introduce me
to your new friends?
And that was the first time
you met her?
Yeah, that was, uh--
That was the first time.
Sarah?
Yeah. Her name was Sarah.
Mr. Stevens, what else
happened in San Diego?
What do you want to know?
Everything.
I got another one!
No! No!
Shh!
Keep it down.
Keep it down.
This is insane, Sarah.
You should never dare
a crazy woman.
Vincent, we should
probably go back.
Luke, lighten up.
It's okay.
Mmm.
Mmm. Said I'd
get you to the pool.
Now you have to keep
your end of the bargain.
Come over here.
Let's sit down.
Yeah.
Oh!
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on.
Don't keep us waiting.
Take it off.
- Think I'm gonna be sick.
- What? Vince's body's
not that bad.
Not Vince,
the shrimp cocktail!
What? Dana! Dana!
Come-- Come back.
Come back here!
Your turn.
No.
Take it all off.
Not bad.
Is this still
too scary for you, Luke?
Are you gonna join us?
I'm--
I'm fine right here.
But I need you,
'cause Vincent's gonna try
and make a move on me soon.
And if you're here,
maybe he won't dare.
Well, maybe Vincent's
not interested.
Maybe Vincent
would rather do laps.
That would explain the last few
hours of casual-but-meaningful
glances...
that each lasted
a second too long.
You like to play games, huh?
Tsk. I do.
And I'll tell you
something else:
I'm better at it than you.
Can you feel me?
Most definitely.
Marty?
Marty, I need my room key.
Dude! I'm kinda busy here.
Don't stop!
Go!
I'm not stopping.
Just do it! Oh!
You're scared,
is what it is.
You're running away
from your feelings.
I don't want to
say good-bye.
Do you have any idea
what it's like
to really love someone?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
Throwing it away.
It's empty.
You were here yesterday,
weren't you?
Guys? We gotta go to the cops.
We're not getting anywhere
with this.
First, I think Vincent
has something to tell you.
All right,
let's hear it.
-
- What the hell?
-  Hello?
- Who is it?
Who is it?
It's a Realtor who
wants to come up. Somebody
listed the loft for sale?
- What?
- Oh, Jesus fucking--
Listed the loft?
She said she has
an appointment with
a Deakins, Sarah Deakins.
Who-- Who's Sarah Deakins?
Wait. Who the hell
is trying to sell our loft?
You know her, Marty.
- What?
- You know her,
and so does Luke.
Sarah Deakins
is lying on the bed.
You guys, I promise,
I've never seen
a Sarah Deakins.
- That's not true.
You know her.
- Why do you keep saying that?
You met her in San Diego
the last night in the bar.
Remember? Dana's friend.
The last night?
I was wasted outta my mind.
The whole night's a blur.
Jesus!
Luke, you remember her,
don't you?
That's Sarah?
You remember Sarah.
You remember her, right?
Yes. I remember Sarah.
But how was I supposed
to know that's Sarah?
Come on, guys.
What the hell's going on?
You guys turned her over
and looked at her face.
- I did not.
-
Yeah. I think there's
been a mistake. We don't know
anyone named Sarah Deakins.
Marty. Come on!
- Who is it? Do we know her?
- I don't know.
Fuck.
So is that all
you wanted to tell us,
Vince?
Or is there more?
I had a thing with her.
I brought her up here
a couple of times.
But I swear on my kids,
I had nothing to do with this.
Would you just fuckin' tell me?
Were you here with her last
night?
Were you the one
who let her in?
I broke up with her last night.
I swear she was alive
when I left.
It still doesn't explain
why someone listed the loft!
Something special
or just browsing?
Why don't you return
my phone calls?
If you're dumping me,
at least have the decency--
Chris, how can I dump you?
There's nothing between us.
So that's what it
meant to you? Nothing?
Did you forget
what I told you already?
Who I am, what I do?
No. I haven't.
It doesn't change
how I feel about you.
How many women have you taken
to that fuck pad you share
with your four buddies?
What?
Please, Chris.
Save it for some girl
who'll actually
buy your bullshit.
Anne, no, wait. Wait.
You know I'm not like that.
Here.
I only need this
if I'm with you,
so you keep it.
If you wanna see me again,
you let me know.
Chris?
Um, what are you
doing here?
Shopping for Alison?
Uh, no. No, um,
I was just here
with a colleague.
Does your
wife know you've been sharing
the loft with your pals?
I already told you,
I'm not sharing a loft
with any pals.
I was there just once,
at a party, when the building
first opened.
Then you have been there.
A minute ago, you didn't even
know where the building was.
I never took anyone up there.
I thought that's what you
meant.
Well, did you know the girl?
We met once in San Diego.
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens
began a relationship
with her in San Diego?
That would surprise me,
frankly.
You didn't know?
Isn't Vincent Stevens
your best friend?
It's so obvious what
you're trying to do here.
You're trying to turn us
against each other.
But guess what?
I'm not about to start
trashing my friend.
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord,
that you are jealous
of your best friend...
when he's nailing
all these beautiful women?
I am a married man.
I'm not interested
in nailing women.
I'm not jealous of Vincent.
Oh, no.
I didn't mean jealous of him,
Mr. Seacord.
I meant jealous of the women.
Where do you get off
with an innuendo like that?
Fucking bastards.
Why are you so angry,
Mr. Seacord?
Vincent is my closest friend.
And he has been for years.
Yeah, fine.
But your best friend
is selling you out
as we speak, Mr. Seacord.
You and the rest of your gang.
No. Vincent would never
sell out his friends.
You're full of shit,
asshole.
What'd you call me?
You heard me,
you lying piece of shit!
I broke up with her
and I left! That's it!
Yeah?
- After you cut her up
with this. Right?
- Put the knife down!
- I didn't kill her.
- Back off.
- What?
- Put the knife--
Put the knife down!
Back off.
What? What?
The loft was listed
in her name.
That's not a coincidence.
- Someone's trying
to pin this on us.
- On you, you mean.
Jesus!
Get a fuckin' grip!
Fuck!
Guys, we cannot
keep doing this.
Well,
what do you wanna do, Marty?
Huh? Just leave me hanging?
Hey, Vince? Vince?
Are you in there?
If you're in there,
hey, man, I need to talk to you
for just a second.
Christ, Marty,
I've got company.
Didn't you get my text?
Mimi's gone.
She's gone. Fucking gone.
What do you mean "gone"?
Gone where?
She left me.
She found out about San Diego.
That dumpy chick, she showed up
and then told her everything.
Fuck!
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell Mimi
about the loft?
What? It's not about
the goddamn loft, Vince!
It's about my wife!
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without her!
Did you--
Did you confess?
Then never confess, Marty.
Never confess.
Would you go to her and just--
just tell her that I love her?
You know?
And that Dana's lying?
She'll believe you.
Marty, I will straighten
this out for you. I promise you
I will straighten this out.
Okay.
Hey, come here.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay, so what's the plan?
What do we do now?
We get her out of here.
We can't just
make a body disappear.
That's too bad.
It's our only hope.
You had a relationship
with her. Now she's some
inconvenient piece of evidence?
- What kind of man are you?
- That's a laugh,
coming from you.
And how do you plan
to get her off the bed?
Cut off her hand?
Or do you have the key
to those cuffs?
I thought handcuffs were more
your thing than mine, Phil.
Meaning what?
You know exactly
what I mean.
Shut up!
Shut up! Just keep
your fuckin' mouth shut!
All right?
Please help-- help me!
Please help me!
Keep that fucking mouth shut!
He's crazy!
This fucking whore's
trying to rip me off!
- Please help me!
He raped me!
- Shut up!
Hey. Hey.
Easy, easy!
What?
- All right. All right.
- It's gonna be okay.
He's crazy!
Shit. Okay, okay.
- Philip, give me the keys.
- Bitch is gonna go
to the cops, man.
- The keys.
- She's gonna go to the cops!
The keys!
- You want the key?
-
- Shit.
- He made me do things
I didn't want to do.
Shut up! Shut up!
Easy. Easy.
What? You want more money?
That's it, right?
It's all about
the money, huh?
It's all about
the fucking money!
Here's your fucking money!
It's right there!
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is
the matter with you?
Have you lost
your fucking mind?
She's a whore, Chris!
Do you know
what a whore is?
Shut up!
- You can't rape a whore!
- Shut up!
- You can't rape a--
- Shut up!
You don't treat a woman
like that!
You got it?
Not any woman!
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
- What the fuck's the matter
with you?
You're putting us all at risk!
I want police.
He-- He hit me.
- Shut--
-
- He raped me!
- Shut up!
Stop screaming, or I'm gonna
rip your goddamn throat out!
I've had it with you.
You're no better
than your father.
- I'm what?
- You heard me.
Oh, right, Chris.
That's a nice one.
Chris had a better deal
with his daddy, right?
The great guy
who wants to save everyone.
Where were you...
when Zoe and I
were getting beat up?
And Mom in the next room...
pretending not to hear.
Where were you?
In your cozy college dorm...
getting laid and wasted
'cause you didn't give a fuck!
I didn't know
anything about it.
You didn't give a crap!
All those years
we didn't exist for you!
I didn't know
anything about it!
If you would've
said something--
Then what, you phony?
Then what?
Then I would've
gotten you out of there,
goddamn it! Both of you!
Listen.
I'm really, really sorry,
but we can't go to the cops.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I have a friend.
He's a doctor.
- No.
- Yes. I'm gonna
drive you to him.
He's gonna take
care of you. Okay?
No. No.
Here. Listen.
Take it. I know it's not enough
for what happened tonight,
but--
He's an animal.
He should be locked up!
And we're gonna
deal with him,
I promise you.
Come on. Get your clothes.
I'm gonna take you
to the doctor.
- No!
- Easy. Here we go.
No.
-
-
I'll never forgive you
for this. Never!
What's the problem?
Jesus Christ!
Why don't I know
anything about this?
- And when did it happen?
- A couple of weeks ago.
We decided to keep it
to ourselves 'cause that's
the kind of friends we are.
Don't lecture me, all right?
Especially about friendship.
Yeah, yeah, right.
Sorry. I meant to give you
the cokehead rapist lecture.
Fuck you.
Well, look.
You can see how I think
you'd be involved in this.
I need to say something.
Oh, shit.
You had that coming!
Hey, come on! Get up!
Relax. Take it easy.
- You son of a bitch.
- You recorded everything
that went on here.
- Every woman--
- Not every.
Not always.
Just... sometimes.
At least I don't
cheat on my wife.
No, you just watch us
and beat off.
- You sick fuck.
- You're a sick fuck!
Luke, did you
record last night?
No.
You didn't say you were coming,
which is against your rules.
And that wasn't the first time
you broke your own rules,
by the way.
Now you're scared,
aren't you?
Now you know I've documented
pretty much everything
you've been up to here.
No worries, Vincent.
I'll keep my mouth shut,
like I always do.
Did you see anything
that can help us out here?
Anything at all?
If all the people
who've been hurt and cheated
on find out the truth,
what do you think'll
happen, Vincent?
What's the matter?
I just don't feel like
leaving tomorrow.
Serious? You love skiing.
Yes, I love to ski,
but just not by myself.
Are you sure
you can't come?
Babe, you know I can't come.
I can't just
take off right now.
Hey. I'll call you every day.
I love you.
I know the drill.
One hour, right?
Wrong.
Have a blast.
Don't mind me.
Why should tonight
be any different from
the past few months?
If it's all right with you,
I'd rather not spoil tonight.
I'm sure it must be tempting
to grab something
shiny and new.
But do you ever think about
what you might stand to lose,
Chris?
You could ruin a lot more
than just this evening.
Tell me.
Are you so happy, Alison?
Well, what do you know?
If it's for charity,
my mother-in-law is
allowed to join the party
for a little while.
Heard anything about
the waterfront project?
No. He's gonna call
once he gets his permits.
Now, as far as I know,
everything's approved.
Really?
Yeah.
Good evening,
gentlemen.
Ladies, you look absolutely
ravishing tonight.
Thank you.
This is Vincent Stevens.
He's the architect who designed
the new loft building
near the sports arena.
Oh, wonderful.
I love that building.
Why, thank you, Mrs. Kotkin.
I really appreciate that.
As I was saying
to your husband
in San Diego,
gentlemen in our business
can't afford to be exposed...
to the negative consequences
of bad design.
Speaking of, uh,
San Diego,
how's that waterfront project
coming along?
Ah, yes. Uh, we're
still working on it.
We've applied
for all our permits
and now we're waiting.
Standing in line
like everyone else.
You don't strike me
as the type of man that
stands in line, Mr. Fry.
What about you, Mr. Kotkin?
Are you a gambling man?
And you, Mr. Stevens?
You like to take chances?
As a matter of fact,
I do.
Especially when I'm holding
a handful of hearts.
Anyway,
I don't mean to interrupt.
Ladies, if you're
as lucky on the tables
tonight as you are in love,
then I am sure
you'll hit your jackpots.
Gentlemen,
always a pleasure.
- Blackjack!
- Wow!
Set aside enough
for the "ali-money."
Mimi, what are you
doin' here?
-Just 'cause I booted you out
doesn't mean I'm stuck at home.
-I want to come back.
I know I screwed up once.
Once.
But I was drunk off my ass.
I swear it didn't mean
a damn thing.
Something I don't understand
about men. If it doesn't mean
anything, why bother?
I promise I'll change.
Into what? A frog?
Certainly not a prince.
How about the ass
you already are?
What if I told you I wanted
to fuck around tonight? Sorry.
It would hurt like hell,
wouldn't it?
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Maybe with one of your pals.
Maybe Chris. He's cute.
Or how about Vincent?
The night you sent him over
for that tragic heart-to-heart.
"Marty's really suffering, man.
Mimi, you've gotta talk
to him."
Blackjack!
Oh! Well, look at that, Tubs.
Your first-ever winning streak.
Just remember, dear heart...
half of it is mine.
Whoo!
I love you!
You gave Zoe a ticket
for tonight?
Philip, let go.
I keep her away
from bullshit like this,
and then behind my back--
Christ, Phil,
she's almost 20 years old.
What are you, her father?
Did you see her?
She looks like a whore.
I thought you like whores.
Yeah.
Let her have some fun.
I'm about to have some fun too.
I'm kind of on a roll.
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.
I hope you win big-time.
You'll need it with all
the shit you've been packin'
up your nostrils.
So you noticed a tiny fraction
of your stash went missing?
If you don't like it,
file for a divorce.
I haven't ruled that out.
Don't forget about
our prenup, loser.
Go play some blackjack.
Could be your last best chance
at paying the rent.
Can I get some dice over here?
Hands off.
Excuse me.
Anne?
Anne?
We need to talk.
Yeah? About what?
Your pal the architect.
He's playing with fire.
I'd actually rather
talk about Anne.
I'll pass along your message
to Vincent, but I'd like
something too, Mr. Kotkin.
I'd like for you
to stop seeing Anne.
And why would I do that?
Because I love her.
Then we have more in common
than we thought.
I'd like you
to stop paying her.
I want you to let her go.
That's really not up to me.
Fact is, it's totally
her choice.
Except I never paid for her.
Well, that's true.
You never paid.
Stop it, Joel.
I'm going.
What did he mean by that--
"You never paid"?
I don't want to
love you, Chris.
Someone's paying you
to be with me?
- You're the only one
who can hurt me.
- Anne?
Tell me it's a lie.
The first time,
it was paid for.
Every other time,
that was real, that was me.
But who paid?
I can't--
Excuse me.
Come on, Zoe, let's go.
I'm fine here.
I'm asking you
to come with me.
And I'm asking you to stop.
- Did you not hear the lady?
- Mind your business.
- Stop!
- Are you deaf
or just a dick? Huh?
I don't know, man.
What does it say up here?
"Deaf" or "dick"?
Help me out. Huh?
-
- Stop! Stop! Leave him alone!
Fuck!
- Come on!
- You filthy piece of shit!
- Excuse me.
- You're just like Dad!
- You are just like him!
- Somebody get this guy
an ambulance.
I never
want to see you again.
Not in my home
and not near my daughter.
Do you got that?
Get him the hell
out of here.
Okay, folks!
Let's get back to
the gaming tables, shall we?
Hey. It's okay.
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's okay.
It's not what
you're thinking.
And what am I thinking?
She's my friend's sister.
Okay?
Are there more besides me,
her and your wife?
What's the grand total?
Look, I can't have this
conversation here. Barbara's
standing right over there.
Do you love me?
Of course I love you.
I'm crazy about you.
But would you choose me
if you could?
You know
it's not that simple.
Come meet me
in the loft tomorrow, okay,
and we'll talk it through.
You're right.
It's not that simple.
But maybe I can make it simple.
What do you mean?
Maybe I can help you
make that choice.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
Don't do it, Sarah.
You'll regret it.
They found out.
Our wives, they--
they set us up.
Why, Vincent?
They--
They found out.
They found out about the loft.
Why would you do it, Vincent?
We're your friends.
-  No.
- Why did you do it?
No.
It was... our wives.
They-- They found out.
No, it's your friends.
We found out.
- What's going on?
- You still don't get it.
All right, strip him.
What are you doing?
- You are a total
fucking psychopath.
- I did what you told me.
I didn't tell you
to fucking cut her open!
That wasn't a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?
Like the cops are gonna
believe that bullshit.
- Then you should've
done it yourself.
- Come on. Let's do this.
What'd you give me?
What you deserve.
You--
You killed Sarah?
No. We just found her.
What?
We were here this morning,
Vincent, before you arrived.
No.
Jesus Christ.
At first I thought
she was sleeping.
And Vincent knows her?
She--
She left him this.
"See you in the next life."
Why did she
have to do it here?
We gotta call the cops.
They investigate suicides.
This is all gonna come out.
Guys, wait.
Can't we find out
where she lives and--
and leave her there?
Jesus.
Philip.
We have to help out Vince.
Speaking of which,
where the fuck is Vince?
Isn't this his problem?
Hmm.
Vincent isn't here
because, uh-- because
I didn't call him.
You didn't call him?
Why didn't you call him?
There's something
I have to show you.
You've been taping us?
You fucking pervert!
You can beat the crap
out of me later.
We don't have much time,
and you need to watch this.
Maybe you'll get
a new perspective on
what happened upstairs.
Maybe you'll agree
we shouldn't take the hit
for Vincent's fuckup.
You see, Vincent--
Vincent hasn't always
been a good friend.
No.
Oh, God!
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Or maybe Vincent, the night
you sent him over for that
tragic heart-to-heart.
They got here late, the night
he went to talk to her.
She was drunk, Marty.
He took advantage.
Wow. Your little sister's
seriously hot.
Hey.
How long has it been--
Doesn't matter.
- How long?
-
He started seeing her
right after your wedding.
They met here
on a regular basis.
If I'm not mistaken,
he was her first.
Fuck!
Gorgeous, huh?
The people you love,
they're the only ones
who can hurt you.
He paid Anne...
to let you seduce her,
put the hook in
so you'd want a share
of the loft.
The first time,
it was paid for.
- Have fun.
- Chris, please.
You don't know the half of it.
All right? Just go home.
He used her, Chris.
Just like he used everyone.
Everyone.
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch.
Vincent can't sense
anything is up
when he walks in.
We have to try
and remain calm.
We're gonna get questioned
by the cops.
That's why we can never admit
we're sharing this loft.
They'll try to turn us
against each other.
Okay. I think this can work
as long as we follow the plan.
Chris?
Okay. I'm in.
But only if we know for sure
that Vincent was here
last night.
I wanna hear him say it.
And if he does,
I'll go through with it.
I'll give a signal--
uh, break something, a glass.
But nothing happens
until we know for sure.
Understood?
We've got just under two hours
to set everything up
and establish alibis.
I'll take care of it.
You guys get out of here.
Make sure people see you.
- Uh, you have
the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.
You knew what
that prick was up to...
and you never
said anything.
You're just as sick as Vincent.
They met here
on a regular basis.
Vincent hasn't always
been a good friend.
He started seeing her
right after your wedding.
If I'm not mistaken,
he was her first.
You are a total
fucking psychopath.
I did what you told me.
I didn't tell you
to fucking cut her open!
That wasn't
a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?
Like the cops are gonna
believe that bullshit.
What happened here?
You're framing me!
- Swallow it. Swallow. Swallow.
-
My own friends.
My own friends!
Am I gonna die?
No, Vincent,
you're not gonna die.
Sarah lured you here
and drugged you.
Then she killed herself,
with you by her side.
"Fate will unite us."
But you're gonna survive.
'Cause we're friends,
aren't we?
So, you see, it was a setup.
Sarah and I were set up.
The whole thing was staged.
Still sounds
a little unbelievable.
Don't you think?
Unbelievable?
But it's the truth.
Yeah.
My line of work,
you gotta prove the truth,
and you prove it
with facts and findings.
Fact is,
we only found your prints
and those of Sarah Deakins.
Yeah, because they
wiped the place clean.
And we have the DVDs of all
your sexual exploits with
your prints all over them.
Luke made those DVDs.
I never even saw 'em,
let alone touched 'em.
Yeah, but we got
no DVDs of your friends.
No DVDs of Marty's wife.
No DVDs of Philip's sister.
No DVDs of Chris's girlfriend.
All right?
Facts and findings,
Mr. Stevens.
And we got no evidence
that you were being set up.
All right.
Is there anything
we've forgotten?
Yeah. To follow the fuckin'
plan. Why didn't you just
handcuff her?
- She was already dead.
- That's still no reason
to mutilate her.
She killed herself!
I just made it more dramatic.
Well, you better hope
your dramatics
don't put us in jail.
Look, just--
just lean on 'em a little bit.
Marty will break.
Maybe Luke too.
Look, don't tell me
how to do my work.
We've questioned them all.
I got no reason to believe
they've been lying.
Plus, all your friends
have alibis.
Alibis?
Not for this morning,
they don't.
We got
Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen
together at breakfast.
We got Marty Landry
at his office.
At his office?
Look, for at least
an hour this morning,
we were all in the loft.
So was Phil.
What about Phil?
He's downstairs right now
with his father-in-law.
Fry? What the fuck's
Fry doing here?
He just gave a statement
saying that he was with
his son-in-law all day.
That is bullshit!
That is a false statement!
And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry brings
a lot of credibility.
Credibili--
I saw Fry in San Diego
with some bimbo! Okay?
Phil knew that. He knew
I pressured Fry into giving me
a waterfront contract.
So you tried to
blackmail Hiram Fry?
Mr. Stevens,
enough of this crap.
We got your prints
all over the DVDs.
We got 'em all over the knife.
We got you chained next
to the dead girl on the bed.
Call your lawyer,
make a confession
and save your ass!
You're free to go.
I want to thank you
for your cooperation.
You understand we had to
check out your friend's story.
Of course.
It's your job.
There's just...
one thing that's bothering me.
Why does Vincent Stevens
keep accusing his best friends?
I-- I don't know.
It bothers me too.
Hmm.
Could it be-- I just--
I just wonder--
Do you think he's trying to
hide something else?
Wh-What would he be hiding?
Sarah Deakins's murder.
Murder?
But the detective
in the interrogation
called it a suicide.
Well, that's what
it looked like.
But the autopsy report
revealed that sleeping pills
didn't kill her.
And her wrist was cut,
but not by Sarah.
Hesitation marks,
those tentative attempts--
the first ones before
a suicide actually slashes
through an artery--
The coroner
didn't find those on her.
But Vincent, he--
he would never--
His prints are on the knife.
We didn't find a suicide note.
Is there something wrong?
We didn't find a suicide note.
You have the suicide note,
right?
I've got it.
Luke.
Chris.
You scared me.
You sure it's smart
meeting here?
I think we
have a problem, Luke.
How so?
Where's Sarah's
suicide note?
You put it in your pocket.
Yeah, I could've sworn I did,
but it's not there anymore.
So when did you
steal it from my coat?
When the doorbell rang
this morning?
Surprise visit
from the Realtor?
Chris, it's--
it's unfortunate that you lost
Sarah's suicide note, but...
I had nothing to do with that.
I called the agency
to ask who put our loft
up for sale.
All they could give me
was a number.
I did call them.
I wanted--
I thought maybe that--
It's over, Chris.
We pulled it off.
We've got nothing
to worry about now.
But why'd that note
disappear?
The only real proof
of her suicide.
Hello?
She says she's got
an appointment with someone
named Sarah Deakins.
Who's Sarah Deakins?
Is it because
maybe she didn't write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting.
Vincent fucked us all.
You saw.
Yeah, I saw.
All the DVDs that
made everybody crazy...
went right along with
your grand plan, didn't it?
But why, Luke?
What'd you do
to that girl?
Did she get in your way,
between you and Vincent?
Actually, it was Vincent...
standing between us.
Is there someone else?
I'm not cheating
on you, Ellie.
Sarah, wait!
Forget Vincent.
He is better at games
than you.
Always was, always will be.
He's hurting you.
Using you.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you because--
because I'd never hurt you.
If you'd just
give me the chance...
to show I'd never hurt you.
That's right. You'd never
hurt me, because I feel
nothing for you, Luke.
I'm sorry.
Maybe in another life.
You were here last night.
Barbara was off skiing.
So I figured
I'd find Vincent here,
with Sarah.
I'm sorry.
I waited till he left.
She said I was
right about Vincent.
Consoling.
I've gotten so good at it.
I gave her an insulin OD.
It's quick, painless...
leaves no trace.
Jesus, Luke.
I did it out of love.
I swear.
And Vincent
taking the fall for this--
That's okay with you?
Vincent used
everyone and anyone!
It's about time
we turned the tables!
Well, he's being charged
with murder.
Yeah. Sarah wasn't dead
when we left her with Philip.
No. No, you're lying.
No.
That's not possible.
What Philip did to her...
was sick!
You're sick, Luke.
But if I'm hearing you right,
it was your brother
who killed Sarah.
Okay, Chris.
Go home.
I'll clean up.
Like always.
No.
No more cleaning up, Luke.
- Step outside.
- No, Luke.
Now.
Jesus. Let me help you,
Luke. Please!
- You're gonna kill me too?
- It's your own fault.
- What do you want me
to do? Jump?
- Yes. If you don't mind.
Luke, you don't need
to do this.
Jesus Christ, Luke!
Would you stop it!
I don't want to hurt you,
Chris. I really don't.
So just do it. Now!
I called the cops
before I came.
I told 'em everything.
Bullshit.
I know you better.
- I thought I knew you.
-
What about the note? Huh?
You want this
to go down with me too?
Give me that note,
Chris.
- Give it to me!
-
It's over, Luke.
You're right.
It is over.
Tell Ellie and the kids...
I'm sorry.
Would you do that
for me, Chris?
- No.
- Come on, Chris.
- Be a friend.
- Luke?
Luke. Luke!
Luke!
They're married.
Honey, no.
They're having an affair.
Why? Because she's
laughing at his jokes?
No. I'm telling you,
they're having an affair.
Since when are you
the big expert on affairs?
Really?
Thanks for
taking me back, Meems.
What was my alternative?
To leave you wailing
at the front door, with snot
pouring out of your nose?
Mmm. Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you off.
I have the kids
early tomorrow,
so I gotta go.
You're gonna leave me
alone with my wife?
Yes.
We could at least
have one more drink.
There'll be
plenty more drinks.
Good night, Meems.
Good night, Chris.
Chris.
Anne.
Hi.
Hi.
You look good.
Thank you. You too.
Listen,
I still have the key.
Do you want it back?
It wouldn't work anymore.
Vincent's living there
alone now.
It's the only thing
his wife let him keep.
And, uh-- And Philip?
He's awaiting trial, so...
we'll see.
And you?
Are you doing okay?
Yeah. Most of the time.
And the rest of the time?
I heard you ditched
the city councilman.
That's not all I've given up.
Uh, do you wanna grab
a cup of coffee, or--
