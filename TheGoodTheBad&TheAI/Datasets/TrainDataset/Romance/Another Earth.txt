Voyager.
-  One, two, three, MIT!
-  Okay. Wait...
I don't want to eat
the apple of cynicism.
-
-
-
-
-
-
That's easy.
What rhymes with..."honey"?
-  "Bunny."
-
He's like,
"All right, enough with it!"
What rhymes...
Let's do some animals.
- You wanna give him some animals?
-  Yeah.
-  What rhymes with...
-  "Lion"?
Oh, my gosh.
-  "Pion."
-  A pion.
A small puma of the high Himalayas.
Did we figure out
what this guy's name is?
- Bob.
- Bob the robot.
He looks to me like a Bob.
Go ahead.
Feel her.
She's in there, all right.
I hope so.
-
-  What rhymes with...
"light"?
-  "Light"?
-  Oh, that's a good one.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-  We don't
even know it really exists.
So did you have a crew
on the inside?
Do you have any tattoos?
-  Jeffrey!
- I'm just taking.
You hear about that guy who's having
the contest to go to the other Earth?
I mean, it's so stupid.
They're gonna get sucked
into a black star and die.
Hmm.
Is it good to be home?
Yeah.
You know,
if you need anything...
Oh. Towels.
Night.
Good night, Mom.
- .
-
I was thinking I would like
to do something with my hands.
You know, maybe...
maybe outdoors, maybe not.
Come on. I mean, you could
do something with your hands,
but you have
such a great mind.
I don't wanna really be around too
many people or do too much talking.
All right.
Well, there's a maintenance position
open at West Haven High School.
Really? About what?
I don't know. We were hanging
out, and he just started fighting...
-  Hey.
-  Oh, hi.
- What are you guys doing?
-  Um, skipping Chemistry.
-  Really?
-  Yeah.
-
-  Guess who just texted me.
-  Who?
-  Kyle.
Is he gonna pick us up?
-
-
-
-
-
-
Rhoda?
Hi. Alex.
I know who you are.
How are you?
How... How is everything?
It's great.
You celebrating?
Yeah. I just got into
business school.
Boston.
Hey, I couldn't get arugula,
but I found this spring mix.
That's good. Uh, this is Rhoda, an
old friend of mine from high school.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Claire.
- Hi.
So, are you working?
West Haven High.
Yeah? What do you teach?
- I clean.
- What?
I clean the school.
Oh, that's cool. That's
probably very therapeutic.
All right. Well, it was
good to see you, Rhoda.
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
-
-
-
-
How do you know her?
High school.
Yeah?
- Mr. Burroughs?
- Mm-hmm.
I, uh...
- What?
- ...came to...
I came to tell you about...
What?
Tell you about a tri... a free trial
of our cleaning service.
What?
I'm from Maid In Haven.
We're a cleaning service.
- We're looking to expand our
territory and our... - No, thank you.
Wait.
Did you say
"trial cleaning"?
- Did you say "trial cleaning"?
- Yeah...
- God.
- Sorry, it's a t...
- Is it definitely free?
- Yeah.
Fine. Let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
You can start in here.
Did you say "Maid In Haven"?
- Yes.
- Like New Haven?
Yes.
You're pretty far from New Haven.
There's a lot
of competition in town,
so we're offering
the free trial as a...
Where are your supplies?
Uh, normally, the first time
is a consultation.
Okay.
Well, you're already here,
so why don't you just...
clean this for a start?
Okay? There's mops
and things in there.
Okay.
I'm gonna be in that room.
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.
...
All right, that's enough.
It's time for you to go.
So... Wait.
Is that it for the free trial?
Yeah, it's a one-day trial.
Um, all right.
So I'll see you next week.
I'll let them know.
They might send someone else.
- Okay.
- Same time, same...
Yeah, this is a good time.
This is a good day too.
So, Jeff, I think we've got
a pretty important toast in order.
- What do you think, huh?
- Hey, hey, hey! Hold on, hold on!
I just got the cider.
Come on, guys,
it's not that big of a deal.
- Oh!
- It is a big deal.
You've shown perseverance
in the face of adversity.
- You deserve to be saluted for that, Son.
-
Come on, Rho-tard.
Aren't you gonna ask what happened?
What happened?
- I got into UConn.
-  And we are so proud of you!
-
-  Hear, hear!
-  Chin-chin!
-
-  Cheers.
-
Mr. Burroughs?
I came to tell you that I saw you
at the site of the accident.
And I'm sorry for what happened
to you and your family.
It was my fault.
Mr. Burroughs.
- Oh. Good.
- Mr. Burroughs.
- I...
- Come on in.
You can start where you finished.
I was wondering if I could
talk with you about something.
Not now. A little bit later.
I'm finished.
Check's on the kitchen table.
We're not real.
W-We're not real.
We're a projection of the
imagination of Earth Two.
Hmm.
-
-
- Whoa! No way!
-
- Dude!
-
-  What?
-  Oh, come on.
- No way, dude! No way!
- What does that... What does that mean?
It's... It's... Listen.
What does that mean?
I don't understand what that means.
Kimberly, it's just
an elaborate hoax.
- There's gotta be an explanation.
-  We're all gonna die.
-  Wait, wait!
- We are all gonna die.
Wanna take a look?
My God.
Yeah.
Wow.
You're up there and I'm up there.
It's just too much.
I wonder if I'm cleaning your house.
Ha!
- Maybe.
-
-  Total's 29.
-  Thank you.
Can you hand me a paper towel?
Thanks.
If you wanna join me...
-
-
-
-
You can come in.
-
-
-
- You wanna play?
I don't know how.
It's easy.
It's easy.
You're a fighter, I'm sure.
The controller's up on the...
Hold the big one
in your right hand.
- You okay playing boxing?
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
To block shots,
you put your hands up.
Face.
And you... You know,
you lean and stuff.
And then for swinging, you just swing.
That's it.
All right?
-
-
-
-
You gotta fight back.
-
- Don't forget your uppercut.
-
- My guy's, uh, on the ground.
That's it.
-
-  God.
How do I hook my...
You gotta swing.
You gotta swing. It's okay.
-
- Easy.
Yeah. Try and break
through this.
Okay. That one...
I gave you.
-
-
-
- Okay.
Well...
That it, or you got
another one in you?
I thought so.
I didn't see your car.
I take Metro-North.
I'll give you a lift.
No, that's all right.
No, it's too cold to wait for the train.
I don't mind the cold.
Really, it's okay.
Okay.
So, are you from New Haven?
Yeah.
- Still have family there?
- Mm-hmm.
You like working
at Maid in Haven?
It's all right.
Yeah. Have you
been doing it long?
Couple months.
- You see that Joan Tallis broadcast?
- Yeah.
- It's crazy.
- I can't stop thinking about it.
Another me up there somewhere.
If you met yourself,
what would you say?
"Hey, you up
for a video game?"
Probably beat me.
What would you say?
"Better luck next time."
- Really?
- No, no.
No, I mean...
I'm sure I'd be speechless.
Up at the corner here is good.
Right here, and then you can just...
No, I'll take you to your house.
Is this it?
Yeah, okay. Right. Turn.
- Yeah, just to the side behind tha van.
- Okay.
- All right. So I'll see you next week.
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the lift.
- Sure.
Oh, um, you know...
I'm sorry. My memory's not
what it used to be. I forgot your name.
I don't think I ever told you.
Really?
That's not very polite of me.
So, it's...
Rhoda.
Rhoda. All right.
Good night, Rhoda.
I'll see you next week.
Good night.
Listen to me.
Keep your mind clear.
And that's it.
You will have peace of mind.
My dear, don't worry.
Learn to adjust yourself.
What happened?
I tried to do too much.
Thanks.
You know that story
of the Russian cosmonaut?
Mm-mmm.
Thanks.
- So, the cosmonaut.
- Mm-hmm.
He's the first man ever
to go into space.
Right? The Russians
beat the Americans.
Mm-hmm.
So he goes up
in this big spaceship,
but the only habitable
part of it's very small.
So the cosmonaut's in there,
and he's got this portal window,
and he's looking out of it, and he
sees the curvature of the Earth...
for the first time.
I mean, the first man to ever
look at the planet he's from.
And he's lost
in that moment.
And all of a sudden
this strange ticking...
Begins coming out
of the dashboard.
- Okay. Yeah.
-
Rips out the control panel, right?
Takes out his tools.
Trying to find the sound,
trying to stop the sound.
But he can't find it.
He can't stop it. It keeps going.
Few hours into this,
begins to feel like torture.
A few days go by
with this sound,
and he knows that
this small sound...
will break him.
He'll lose his mind.
What's he gonna do?
He's up in space,
alone, in a space closet.
He's got 25 days left to go...
with this sound.
So the cosmonaut decides...
the only way
to save his sanity...
is to fall in love with this sound.
So he closes his eyes...
and he goes into
his imagination,
and then he opens them.
He doesn't hear ticking anymore.
He hears music.
And he spends
the remainder of his time...
sailing through space
in total bliss...
and peace.
Why... are you cleaning houses?
I like to clean.
- Nobody likes to clean.
-
Some people build houses,
some people decorate them,
some people clean them.
How old are you?
Did you go to college?
No.
I read.
A wise choice.
I was a college professor.
You learn more doing it by yourself.
Did you hear about
that contest?
Mmm?
- The shuttle to Earth Two?
- Mmm.
I submitted an essay.
You did?
It's silly.
You'd go?
Yes.
You don't know what's out there.
That's why I would go.
It's a bad idea.
In Plato's allegory of the cave,
the people living in the cave...
All they knew,
what was in the cave,
and one day
one of them gets out...
and goes out and...
sees the real world,
comes back and tells the others.
You know what happened to him?
They beat him up.
They didn't believe it.
"T hat can't be," they said.
I don't think we're ready
to know what's out there.
It's a bad idea.
So you'd rather
stay in the cave?
I mean,
if Galileo had felt that,
we'd still think we're the center of the
universe, that the sun is orbiting us.
I mean... They tried to burn him
at the stake for that.
Yeah, maybe they should have.
We still think we're
the center of the universe.
We call ourselves Earth One,
and them Earth Two.
You think they called
themselves Earth Two?
- Probably not.
- Did you wash that?
- Did you wash that sweater?
- Yeah. Yes. I didn't dry it. I...
- I laid it...
- Give me that.
Why did you wash that?
Stop washing things.
Just stop washing things!
Leave them alone! Please!
Just go!
Where's Purdeep?
Checked out.
When's he coming back?
I don't think he is.
Poured bleach in his ears.
What?
- Yeah.
-
Why would he do that?
Look. I don't know.
I mean, why'd he pour bleach in his eyes?
- He blinded himself?
- Yeah.
You didn't know?
He said he was tired
of seeing himself everywhere.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Um, would you mind coming around
to the passenger side?
- Just 'cause there's traffic and...
- Oh.
I tried to reach you at your work, but
they said they had never heard of you.
Um, management
changes there all the time.
Is that why none of my checks
have been cashed?
That's weird. L...
It must've slipped through their books.
I mean,
I've been getting paid, so...
Okay. Well...
Anyway, that's...
That's not why I'm here.
I wanted to apologize for the other day.
- You know, I just...
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been...
...touching things in your room.
- No, it's not...
It's not your fault.
I should not have gotten upset.
I'm sorry.
Can I take you somewhere...
and show...
show you something?
Right now?
Yeah.
- I have to help my mom out, but...
- Please,
come with me?
The best seat in the house
is this row, right here.
Uh, it's the one in the middle.
Okay.
Just a little out of tune.
That's better, huh?

I'd finally got to
a content place in my life.
Our son was five, and my wife
was pregnant with a girl.
And then...
they were killed.
Drunk driver.
A teenager.
I was in a coma.
And I was sleeping
all the time.
And I was so... angry.
So afraid of what I might do to that kid.
You know?
So I made sure my brother got
all the court documents.
The driver was a minor,
so I never found out the name.
Are you still there?
He can't hear
or see anything.
Okay.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Rhoda.
You are wondering why.
No.
No.
No.
You know why.
Oh, Rhoda.
Yeah, I got some information
you might want to hear.
Shoot a three for it.
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay. Wait. Wait.
Um, I'll give you a hint.
Do you wanna get high?
With you?
No, no.
Do you want to get high?
They called.
Number's on your door.
Seriously?
Seriously.
-
- Wait. Hey.
You better write back to me
this time, okay?
Hello. This is, uh,
Rhoda Williams.
My brother gave me
this number.
-
- Yes.
...
Do I...
Yes.
##
##

Hi.
A nice surprise.
You're all dressed up.
Do you remember that essay
contest I told you about?
Travel to Earth Two?
Uh-huh.
I won.
I'm gonna go to space.
You won. That's great.
That's fantastic.
We have to celebrate. Come here.
- Come on. We have to.
-
Come here.
We have to celebrate.
First things first...
is to start with a drink.
We have to celebrate.
I can't believe...
How many people...
How many people wrote in?
That is...
I'm so happy for you.
To the coming true
of your most improbable dream.
Congratulations.
Next step is a feast.
- I'm gonna cook you a celebration feast.
- Yeah.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay, uh, food.
We need food first.
And...
do they know
how prepared you are?
I mean, with the Joan Tallis
costume, for Halloween?
I will be fully
trained in the Mojave Desert.
Oh. Well, that's comforting.
They made me sign
this waiver.
Basically every other line of it
says, "If you die, it's your fault."
And you seem... you
seem totally okay with that.
You know, you'll need
an executor for your will.
Do you have one?
No, but I don't have anything.
Okay, so nothing to no one.
Sounds pretty easy.
I think I could handle that.
Um, burial or cremation?
I think my body would
probably burn up on reentry.
Or be lost in space, so...
Okay. Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.
We'll have to hold
a memorial service.
Who would you like to attend?
I don't know.
You?
Don't go.
Please don't go.
We're so close
to something here.
We can't.
Why can't we?
- You know that we can't.
- I know that we have.
Stay, please?
Let me tell you a story.
And if, after,
you still want me to stay,
I will stay.
It's about a girl.
At the start, she's...
naive,
reckless.
She does something that is...
unforgivable.
And one day,
she goes to apologize.
But she loses her nerve.
She's weak.
She lies to him.
And then...
she thinks that she might,
in the smallest ways,
be able to make his life
just a little bit better.
And so she wakes up
every day just to do that.
And some days
she thinks it's for him.
Other days, she worries
that it's for herself,
that it was really just a way
to survive what I have done.
But I think that
I do make you happy.
Oh, my God.
I know that
you make me happy.
It was my fault.
I killed your wife and your son.
You better leave.
Get out.
Get out now!
Now!
- Oh. Oh. Can you get...
-
-
-
-
Just one photo.
Rhoda.
You couldn't have told us?
- We had to find out from the media?
- I ju...
I just found out.
I wasn't sure I wanted to go.
I didn't...
Are you going?
I'm gonna go.
Well, now...
now, wait a minute.
I mean, don't you think we... we should
have a discussion about this?
-
- Oh, they're in the backyard now.
Look, Rob...
Rhoda. Rhoda.
-
-  Stay away!
-
-  Get away from me.
- Please let me in. Please. Just...
- Stay... Stay away from me!
- Stay away!
-
John?
- John?
-  Stay away from me.
John, please let me in.
- Stay away from me!
- Open the door.
- I'm warning you, stay away from me!
- Please.
I have something I have to explain.
I have to tell you. Please.
Wait.
Okay...
John.
- Do it.
-
I heard on TV about a theory.
They think...
that the moment
we first saw the other Earth...
was the moment
our synchronicity was broken.
That was just
over four years ago.
Maybe they're up there.
Maybe not, but...
maybe.
- See you, Freddie.
