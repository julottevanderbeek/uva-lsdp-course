Hey, driver.
Oh, happy Easter, Excellency.
What is it you want, Stepal?
Could you drive to the Casbick
And ask General Boynin
to come here immediately?
Isn't it too late for the church
to save that master of yours?
No. 10.
On Easter night, 20.
All right, Stepal. Happy Easter to you.
Please, hurry.
Leave it to me.
It's very urgent. Please.
Don't you adore Russian food?
Faster.
Faster!
Faster!
General,
I'm just mad for your place.
It's always a pleasure
to see you here, Madame.
General Boynin, my husband.
Excuse me, general.
The count Periosov
is waiting outside in his taxi.
He has a message for you.
From Stepal?
Yes. He says it is urgent.
I'll be right out.
Will you forgive me for just a moment?
Is she here?
Yes, sir.
Where?
Over there by the tree.
Are you sure?
Yes, Excellency.
All right. Wait here.
Happy Easter.
Happy Easter, Anna Corev.
It is Anna Corev?
Or at least so you were called
in the asylum at St. Cluv.
You see the resemblance?
No more than 100 women might have.
There is nothing to fear. I promise you.
Why do you always run away?
Always questions.
I have lost the answers.
Perhaps if you hadn't told
a nun who you were,
There wouldn't be any questions.
Who am I?
Grand Duchess Anastasia, I believe.
In an asylum, a nun might be mad.
It's contagious.
Then you do admit you were
in that asylum, don't you?
Stepal, are you positive
She is the same woman
you saw in St, Cluv?
Yes, sir.
Come on.
Let me go. Please, let me go.
The general said to wait for him
at the usual place.
Wait! How do you like that?
The nerve of that Boynin.
Didn't he leave us a message?
Yes. He said he'd be back shortly.
Late. Always late.
Petrovin, the hour has arrived for me...
I know.
You only tell me
what you are going to tell Boynin.
Still, be happy now.
In one week, you shall be
telling it in prison.
Petrovin, I forbid that word.
I didn't hear it.
It's the logical end to what
was always a ridiculous scheme.
Ridiculous scheme, huh?
Well, your eyes lit up
like those of a mad monk
When you heard our tsar's daughter
might be alive.
That was ridiculous.
And yours lit up when you heard
he had a 1o million inheritance.
Equally ridiculous.
Not equally.
The 1o million lie waiting
in The Bank of England,
But the Grand Duchess Anastasia
Nikolayevna lies buried in Russia.
Vodka?
No, thank you.
My indigestion has been shocking
Ever since Boynin decided to
form our corporation.
Boynin decided? The idea was mine.
My years of banking experience
are for nothing?
I devised the method of
setting Shestu stockholders
To pay for the search for
their beloved grand duchess.
I worked out the ratio
of so many shares in her inheritance
To so many shares of our stock,
And I... I know, Boynin was nothing.
Boynin was nothing.
Good evening, comrades.
The term doesn't grate
on your white Russian ears.
Huh?
Excuse me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
The meeting is called to order.
Called to order? Just like that?
May we have the financial report,
please?
The financial...
Yes, the financial report.
There's another report, general.
All in due time, Petrovanch.
Go ahead, Chernov.
As of today,
our treasury shows assets...
Of... here... exactly 5,25o francs.
That new suit looks very well on you,
my dear Chernov.
Am I wrong, or were there not
Some 9,ooo-odd francs
at our last meeting?
My dear general, may I ask you...
May I ask you what paid
for this club of yours?
that's what.
We live in one room,
Petrovin and I. Two.
We share the bedroom.
This is not a meeting
on your housing problem.
Proceed with our accounts.
Housing problem. Hmmph!
Formerly dressmaker
of the imperial family,
Paid for the information I received
on clothes and measurements.
I see you've made good use
of the information.
I drew it myself.
Those are her exact measurements.
The crown is a nice touch.
Yeah. A face would be a better one.
It's all too late now.
We're facing disaster.
As a son of the former deacon
to His Majesty's court,
You should have more faith.
I wish my poor father,
bless his soul, had had less.
All right, Chernov. Please,
give him the news.
I would rather have his first.
Mine?
I know that smile.
I'll bet you have another
Of your brilliant surprises for us.
Never mind. What happened, Petrovin?
Chernov... I was summoned by
the stockholders' committee.
Oh? How kind of them.
Kind, eh?
The old General Anikin
came straight to the point.
"Years ago," he said,
"Rumors started that the Grand Duchess
Anastasia Nikolayevna,
"Daughter of His Imperial Majesty
Nicholas II,
"Had not been murdered
with the rest of the royal family,
"But had escaped miraculously.
A year ago," he went on,
"You and your friends
came to us with a claim
"You knew Her Highness
was somewhere in Berlin.
Then you said you found her,
but she ran away."
Was it then we thought
of using the redhead?
No. No. The one who was always giggling.
Ah, yes. The redhead came later.
Go ahead.
Then he said,
"you needed more money to find her.
"Again we subscribed.
"Then you said you found her,
but she was too sick.
More money."
Too sick? That was galena... too stupid.
"How long can she be sick, Chernov?
How much money can you drain
from our thin pockets, Chernov?"
How much have they got, Chernov?
The joke is on us, general.
They give us exactly eight days.
Eight days for what?
Eight days to produce Her Highness,
the Grand Duchess Anastasia.
Or we go to prison for fraud!
Well, it has taken them long enough.
Is that all you can say?
It sickens me how you
let him make you suffer.
How you like to suffer,
And you delight in making him suffer.
Not particularly.
I merely thought it
advisable to determine
Exactly what our situation was
Before suggesting how to deal with it.
What did I tell you? All right,
general, let's have your surprise.
Where is she?
Where is who?
The woman Stepal saw
in the asylum at St. Cluv.
Correct.
We have finally tracked her down.
Really?
Of course, she does not admit
that she was there.
Really?
Nor does she admit that
she told a nun there
That she was the tsar's daughter.
What does she admit?
Nothing.
Then why do you believe...
I think she may be lying,
But the important thing is that,
Properly used,
she may serve our purpose.
How?
She has certain surprising features.
Such as?
You will see. She also has
a rather intriguing strangeness
Of course, that may simply be
the result of amnesia.
Him and his surprises.
If he were looking for a grand duke,
he wouldn't find so many.
Stepal,
Bring her in.
Come over here.
Don't worry.
These two gentlemen are friends.
Here. Sit down.
How about a glass of vodka?
It will do you good.
Thank you.
There's nothing to fear.
They merely want to examine you.
Examine? Are they doctors?
Well, they don't help.
Doctors? No, they are not doctors.
No. No. We should have kept the redhead.
That tsar's daughter
drinks like a cossack.
May I have a cigarette?
Sure. Here.
Where am I?
I told you, with friends.
Strange.
What?
The resemblance to the other.
Yes, both female.
Have you gentlemen considered
what she went through?
The streets, probably.
I can imagine her walk.
Stand up.
What did you say?
Oh, ho ho! I said stand up.
We would like to see you
walk over to there,
If you please.
No. At least with the redhead,
We could have dyed her hair,
but a walk...
The grand duchesses learned
With books on their heads.
You could recognize them
by their carriage alone.
Stone walls.
What's she talking about?
Chernov, that bookkeeper
who nearly ruined you
Would you recognize his walk today?
Would you recognize the smile
of a girl you knew 1o years ago?
I didn't think of that.
You are both fools.
You are examining her
as if she was the real Anastasia.
There is no Anastasia.
She was shot to death
We are not looking for her, gentlemen.
We are seeking
only a reasonable facsimile.
Reasonable, yes,
but that is unreasonable.
Please, let's be constructive.
Besides, what will the committee say?
Most of them have seen the original.
How? At a court ball from a balcony?
In church by candlelight,
flickering shadows?
Yes, you saw her. Many saw her
From a distance or in the newspapers.
What about the servants?
Some of them are here in exile.
They saw her through devoted tears,
and they will again.
All right. Then the family?
The family?
If it was the immediate family,
I would not try,
But they are dead,
And do you have faith in the memories
of uncles, aunts, cousins?
I don't.
You have faith in nothing.
They will closet themselves
in their bedrooms
And secretly peer at yellow photographs
Which that woman will resemble.
That?
Yes, that.
Rouge will turn the mouth up a bit.
Some powder, a new coiffure,
Dresses to suggest the other period,
walk, manner, voice
Taught along with faces, names, places.
It would be easier
If I could present her to the committee
lying in her coffin.
Yes... no questions, no answers,
no mistakes.
No money, either.
I know. Now I know.
Know what?
It's a cellar.
You brought me down here to shoot me.
Are you mad?
It's a cellar!
This is absurd. Sit down!
No.
Sit down, I said!
Ha ha ha! Pretty good. Pretty good.
A little more rehearsal, perhaps.
What?
He told her how the real one
was shot in a cellar...
Don't be stupid. I told her nothing.
The woman can undoubtedly read,
And certainly enough has been written
Describing their death in the cellar.
Some say she did not die.
Where did you get that?
He just said so... from a book,
Or a story I was told
or a rumor, a whisper.
Or it... it happened.
It did not, and that woman
is too something...
Too crazy, too clever, too tricky.
I don't care what she is.
The important thing is that she fits.
Get up. Go over there.
What is it?
Just a drawing. Stand closer.
Turn around.
The correct height.
The correct height.
Yes. The crown might belong on her head.
A drawing of whom? Who is it?
A princess, a Russian grand duchess
who died in 1918.
A princess?
Ha ha ha ha!
Petrovin, a glass of water.
It's all right.
It's all right, Petrovin.
Her Highness is better.
Don't call me that!
How well you hear,
And how well you know how to use
what you hear, and when.
It was you who told the nun
That you were
the Grand Duchess Anastasia.
Sick people get sick ideas.
Then you were in that asylum
in St. Cluv.
And before that, in Berlin.
Let me out of here!
You know you were.
You were, and you weren't.
Why and why not...
Questions like that can only be
answered by lies! Let me go!
Stop it! Stop it!
No.
No.
Please. Please.
Don't! Don't!
Look at her hand.
What?
Go on. Look.
Well, he wants us to look. All right.
Come. Now, come under the light.
Sit down.
Open your hands.
I told you there were
surprising features.
On the palm of each hand, a scar.
As from bullets?
Now look at her head,
above the left temple...
A narrow depression extending
almost to the forehead.
Just as we were told.
Where did you get those scars?
A gift from an unknown admirer.
Where?
I don't remember.
Wounds like that,
and you don't remember?
Who are you?
No one.
Who are your parents?
None.
Where are you from?
The river.
Before that?
A madhouse.
And before that?
Another river and another madhouse.
Come on, now. Who are you?
You tell me.
You must be someone.
Why?
Nobody, nothing, no one.
Incredible.
But most convenient for us.
All right, gentlemen, come over here.
Add up the facts...
One, she has a certain resemblance,
which we can heighten.
Two, she's obviously smart enough
to learn what we teach.
Discrepancies in her memory
can be attributed to the head wound.
Three, she has no identity whatsoever,
Which means it will be
exceedingly difficult
For anyone to prove that
she's someone else.
Four...
We have eight days.
Precisely. All in favor of
the candidate...
Two to one. Elected.
Two to one. Elected.
Do you realize there are
Yes, my dear.
The inheritance of 1o million
Left by the tsar in The Bank of England,
And you want to risk it on a madwoman.
I must still be in the asylum
With the one who sat covered
and crouched on the floor
Because she wasn't born yet.
It's you who are mad!
I'll have no part of this!
Now, now, my dear.
The carriage of the head
not quite so high.
Grand duchesses are proud
But also modest.
They are to be killed, not to be sold!
There you are, mad as a hatter.
Now she really thinks she is Anastasia.
I do not. I am not.
But you can be.
I can make you Anastasia.
She's dead. You said so yourself.
That doesn't matter.
Please. Please. No one will believe it.
The family, they call the lie.
No matter what they think,
they will accept you.
For 1o million, gladly.
They would accept me
and pretend to love me for money?
Is that what they are like?
Isn't everyone?
No. I'm going.
Where? To the river or the madhouse?
You have no papers.
The police will pick you up soon enough.
If you don't die of starvation sooner.
Oh, come, come. Why, then,
Did you tell those stories
in the hospital?
To the little nun?
Her eyes grew big as a child's,
but then in the evening,
She brought me special things to eat...
An orange or some grapes.
We can bring you much more.
But in another hospital,
I told other stories,
And they believed them, too,
Especially the one
where the train blew up.
We were too close to
where the mine was planted,
So when the train hit it,
Pieces of metal fell
like a shower of fireworks
All about us.
The man beside me was killed,
and the man beside him, too,
But I was only wounded.
Oh, so that's how you got those scars.
Yes. So it would seem.
I thought you couldn't remember.
I can't always. Things come and go,
like waves of mist.
But, look, to be her is what you want,
what we want,
Even what the royal family wants.
So I've heard before. All of it...
"Say this. Remember that.
You are. You are not.
I know you, I don't know you."
Oh, I've heard it many times.
Where?
Bucharest, Berlin...
Berlin?
Or china! I don't remember,
but the enthusiasm and the promise,
It's those I remember,
and then when memory failed,
Disappointment, anger, dismissal.
Out in the street...
failure! Fake! Nobody!
There you are wrong.
There will not be failure this time,
not with me.
Now, listen, you want to know
who you are, don't you?
Oh, yes.
You want to find the family
to whom you belong, don't you?
Yes. Yes.
By yourself, you are lost,
but with me, you'll find yourself.
Oh, please. I'm tired.
You know I am right.
The album... take the chance.
It's the only one you have.
I'm too tired to argue.
You don't have to do anything.
I will do it all. Now, here, look.
It's you on the deck
of your father's yacht.
The Standart.
The Standart?
You know the name?
It's written on the lifeboat.
Oh, yes.
Now, here you are with your family...
Your father the tsar,
your mother, your sisters,
Your little brother.
My family.
And here...
Look.
of the house of Romanov...
There they are on the balcony
of the winter palace,
And that little girl there, that is you.
Thousands kneeling.
Singing god save the tsar.
The people. Your people.
Yes.
You can see it, can't you?
Yes, I can.
Now, may I present your staff?
Belis Andreis Chernov,
formerly of St. Petersburg,
Banker.
Petrovanch Petrovin, former student
of the theological seminary.
Sergei Pavlovich Boynin,
general of the Chekist regiment,
Former aide-de-camp
Attached to the person
of His Imperial Majesty Nicholas II,
Tsar of all Russia.
And I am...
I am Her Imperial Highness,
The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Now, once more.
Awakened in the middle of the night
And taken down to the cellar...
And then, without warning...
Guards appeared in the doorway
and began firing,
But one fainted, shielded
by the body of her sister...
Which sister?
Was it Olga?
Right.
Yes. Her white dress, then darkness.
One of the executioners
crashed down with his rifle.
Later two brothers were among the guards
That came into the cellar
to remove the dead.
One of the bodies moved.
Hers.
Hidden in a farm cart under straw,
Wrapped in sheets filled
with snow for her fever,
They fled across the country,
Bribed guards with jewels
sewn into her blouse.
Skirt.
Was it?
And they made their way to?
I don't know.
Balta.
Balta.
And from there across
the Romanian border to?
Bucharest.
And there?
There...
There she died of heartbreak
and was thrown into the sea
To the strains of an old Russian waltz.
It was all quite good up to the end.
This icon... you are supposed
to have seen it before.
Remember? Where was it?
In my mother's bedroom.
She was very religious,
and she placed holy pictures everywhere.
Right.
And books and albums just like these,
Scattered about, overflowing the tables,
And there was a sitting room
Between the bedroom
of my mother and my fa...
Oh, no. That was that little
reading room in the hospital.
Oh, how silly.
More coffee? She won't sleep.
She hasn't got time to sleep.
I don't very much anyway, but thank you.
All right, where were we?
Oh, yes. Your mother.
But I know what I am talking about.
We have exactly three days left.
Let us worry about one thing at a time.
"One thing at a time."
All right, Petrovanch, I'll take over.
I think she's very tired.
I've had my coffee.
Besides, it all helps to
bring my memory back,
And maybe one memory
will convince someone,
Even if it's only me.
Where did you live in the winter?
The winter palace, St. Petersburg.
Right. Spring?
Spring?
I don't remember.
Tsarskoe Selo.
Tsarskoe Selo.
Summer?
Peterhof, Livadia...
Preferred for the sea air.
Hunting season?
Spala.
Where?
In Poland.
Petrovanch.
And on the Baltic?
No luck, general. The committee...
In Moscow, you stayed...
At the Kremlin.
Sergei Pavlovich, no.
The committee will not
give us even one more day.
You think she's ready?
No. Of course, she thinks she is.
Listen, she thinks she's Anastasia,
And the great Stanislaviski once said,
"When an actor believes he is
The character he's playing, fire him."
It's a bit late for that.
Well, it's a bit late for anything.
The eight days are finished.
The play is finished.
We are finished.
The play is merely
replaced by a pantomime.
Our leading lady will be very weak,
exhausted, too sick to talk.
With careful staging,
the committee will be satisfied.
And careful casting.
Her Imperial Highness
will be too weak to see
Any more than, let us say, six members.
Why six?
Three stupid enough
to accept even you as Anastasia.
Three important enough to spread
the news that she is Anastasia.
Your Highness, may I present
a few members of our colony here,
Who, as I told you, are anxious
to see you for just a moment.
His Excellency
Count Ilia Feodorovich Bikhmetev
And his brother,
Count Andrei Feodorovich Bikhmetev,
His Excellency Count Assessor Shushken.
Shushken.
What?
Your Imperial Highness.
His Excellency Von Bridnetz.
It's very rude to stare.
Forgive me.
Difficult to say.
Madame Deresianskaia.
Come closer.
No. You, please.
I think I know you.
Were you not a lady-in-waiting
To my mother?
Many people know that, I'm afraid.
I'm trying to remember more.
When I was a child, I used to watch
The faces of the ladies- In-waiting
To see if they were wearing lip rouge.
My mother did not allow make-up, so I...
I was not mean, just mischievous
I used to report to her.
What was it my mother used to call you?
Sura, um... Zena...
I'm sorry. It escapes my...
Nini.
Yes, Nini.
Your Highness. Your Imperial Highness.
What's the matter?
Don't you like my borscht?
No.
Too bad.
The general says you have to eat it.
She won't eat!
All right, go.
This entire household,
Everything has been turned
upside down just for you,
To make you comfortable,
to help you get well.
I don't like borscht.
I don't care whether
you like it or not! Eat it!
I specifically warned you
not to say one word to that committee.
You could have ruined everything.
I told you about Nini, didn't I?
Maybe. I don't know.
Yes, I did or Petrovin did
or you overheard us,
But the important thing...
Are you angry because you're
beginning to wonder who I am
Or because you want me to do nothing
except what you tell me?
I know who you are not,
Just as I know that
unless you do as I tell you,
I'll have an extra cigarette girl
at my club.
We now have a breathing spell
we need badly.
You still have a great deal to learn
If you are to achieve
what we have agreed.
Do you understand?
Yes, I understand, Excellency.
Then finish your dinner and get to bed.
Work begins again in the morning.
And now, royal etiquette.
All right...
A queen.
Your Majesty.
A prince of royal blood.
Your Highness.
A prince of ordinary station
Outside of the royal family.
Prince, I suppose, or your Excellency.
This is absurd!
Even Anna Corev wouldn't know all of it!
Pick up the book.
But why do I need it?
Pick up the book.
Put it on your head and walk over there.
You don't seem to realize
that the gesture,
The grace, the carriage
of a true daughter of a tsar...
Cannot be taught.
Either she learns
as a child how to hold herself,
Or it's too late, Excellency.
Did she like to play as a child?
No, but your mother wanted you to.
I still don't like it.
My hands don't have
the strength anymore.
All right. We can use that
as an explanation,
But listen to this.
Now, this is important.
Your tutor wanted you to learn this
To prove to your mother
That the lessons were not in vain.
Did I ever learn it?
Yes, but you hated it.
I like it now.
It's quite pretty.
Now around.
That's it.
Once more.
All right. Now the polonaise.
Can't I rest?
Yes. After dinner. Here we go.
I can't.
You will. Head up. Back straight.
Please.
Please concentrate.
And 1, 2, 3.
My feet hurt. I can't anymore.
A little rest, perhaps...
There is no time.
New waltz, Petrovanch. Come on.
I'm sure you won't mind doing this.
This is the waltz you like so much.
The back. The back.
With ease, with style.
Didn't you say the other day
it reminded you of something?
Yes. Of my first ball.
And your first love, no doubt.
Yes.
Who was he?
I can't remember.
Was he fair,
Or was he dark with a moustache?
I don't know.
One day he's fair, the next he's dark.
I don't know.
Aah!
What are you doing here?
I can't anymore.
I don't know who I am anymore!
I don't know what I remember
or what I've been told I remember!
What is real? Am I?
Anna.
Anna. Am I Anna?
Why not Tamara? Why not Liza?
Why not Tatiana?
Yes. Why not Tatiana?
Oh, I can't anymore.
I don't want this.
I want to be me, whoever I am.
I want to be me.
I want someone to tell me,
someone to accept me.
Look, you have been working very hard,
and you are overtired,
But we're almost finished now.
Are you? Oh, then you know who I am.
A good night's sleep...
You must know! You must!
Just go to bed.
No! I'm leaving! I'm leaving!
Stop it!
Go to bed at once!
My father was very strict.
I did not like to obey,
but he was ringmaster in the circus.
General Boynin.
Yes?
Who am I?
I don't know.
Their Excellencies
Countess Uradif and daughter
And Prince Tergancev.
My dear Madame, her Highness
and the general will be here shortly.
May I thank you again for all of us
for what you're doing.
I should not be thanked.
It makes me happy to do anything
That will help restore
what is rightfully...
Yes.
Oh, Excellency.
His Excellency General Cavelefsky.
I cannot tell you how important
your presence is here today.
My dear Vivina,
I promised your late father
I'd keep an eye on you.
On occasion, it's a little trying.
I promise you will not regret coming.
That's a promise you may have
some difficulty in keeping.
May I sit down?
Do, please.
This abominable gout.
This way.
Albert, a chair for his Excellency.
Take care of his Excellency.
You know how he is.
Baron and baroness Ryobi.
The old fox himself.
I never thought he would come.
Well, we may wish he hadn't.
How many are you taking?
People will think you're hungry.
Hungry? Well, I'm not hungry.
I'm nervous. No, thank you.
His Excellency Count Razumov.
Xenia!
Misha!
I must say, a truly wonderful occasion.
Yes.
What?
Red caviar.
You mean...
Yes.
If the caviar were real...
She would be real.
Your Excellency, remain here, please.
Remain here, your Excellency.
Remain here!
We will see that they come to you.
I understand.
So many old faces.
Yes. And it is their dear
old names we want...
Huh?
We want their names on signed statements
That will convince the bank...
Yes.
Her Imperial Highness,
the Grand Duchess Anastasia.
This way, your Highness.
Francois, the Alcove.
My dear general,
this is all so exciting.
Your Imperial Highness, please.
Well, Petrovanch.
Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dear friends,
Oh, I would like to say a few words...
Too much. She's doing too much.
It's very difficult for me to speak today.
General Boynin, would you please?
As you all know, I am the last one
To believe in miracles or resurrections.
But reality cannot be
established without help,
Legal help... witnessed
and signed statements.
It is, frankly, our hope, our need,
That those among you who believe
Will come forward after the reception
And sign these testimonials voluntarily.
Now, I'm quite sure that some of you
have come here to obstruct.
The reasons... political, monetary,
we all know.
There are some who have been made
Understandably cynical
by the revolution,
And there are some
Who will testify to anyone
and anything... and have.
To none of you do we bring any pressure.
To all of you, we bring someone
Who has literally suffered wors
than death for 1o lost years.
It is our duty to restore
this extraordinary person
To the world of the living.
If you are sentimental, say it is
because she has suffered enough.
If you are humane,
say justice must be done.
If you are Russian,
a loyal subject of his late Majesty,
Then say with me,
"our only hope is his daughter,
Her Imperial Highness,
Anastasia Nikolayevna."
Her Excellency Countess Voronova.
Your Highness, when Irina...
when Madame Deresianskaia told me,
I confess I really had doubts.
You can understand.
It really is a miracle.
Is it?
Yes, your Highness.
We met only once...
I remember.
Near the tennis courts at Livaldia.
Yes.
I also remember that my uncle Alex
Got you the title
because he liked dancing.
But from then on,
you made a fool of him.
My mother never liked you,
My father never liked you,
And I never liked you. Please go.
Now, just a moment.
You're not Anastasia yet,
And if I have...
I said please go!
You are mad.
Don't answer.
But I warn you for the last time.
Your Excellency, you're not leaving
without seeing her Highness.
I have seen her.
Oh, but she will be so disappointed
at not having seen you again.
And how do you know that?
Huh? You mean how do I...
Truthfully, Excellency, we don't,
but we're sure she will.
We're sure, Excellency.
And I. Dear Ivan Vaselevich,
you stayed this long,
And after all, you did promise me...
Now, don't wheedle, Irina.
Oh, all right.
But don't try to keep me there too long.
My foot hurts.
I think you are due for a surprise.
His Excellency...
I'm so glad to see you, Ivan Vaselevich.
They told you my name. How kind.
Won't you sit down?
No, thank you. I don't expect to stay.
My father's chamberlain
was a man of great courtesy.
His Majesty complimented me
on many things.
I don't recall his mentioning courtesy.
My father's chamberlain
was also a temperate man
Who did not judge before...
Madame, forgive me.
I've a miserable attack of gout
Undoubtedly a punishment
for being intemperate,
And I'm eager to return to
my tub of hot water.
There are many characteristics
which you could recall,
Many details,
but so could dozens of others.
My relations with His Majesty's
children were impersonal, public.
So in the end,
My judgment can only be
a matter of opinion,
And that opinion can only be determined
by resemblance and manner.
Your Excellency,
No. I've already noted the resemblance.
As for the manner, I've been watching,
And you give me pleasure.
You've taken me back to my seat
In the imperial theater
at St. Petersburg.
Second row on the aisle
every Tuesday night.
For the purpose of acting
is not only to imitate reality,
But to create illusion.
I'm not being sarcastic
when I say that you are
An excellent actress, Madame...
extremely well-trained.
My compliments.
I do not accept them.
Madame, my foot is troubling me.
My life is troubling me,
and it has yet to be lived.
You do not believe
because you do not wish to believe.
You say my words will not convince
Because you're afraid
I know the right words.
You misquote, Madame.
I also said that the manner,
the deportment of a grand duchess
Would convince me,
but I don't see it in you,
Not a gesture,
Though one would be worth
more than all the words
You undoubtedly can produce.
Good day, Madame.
How dare you smoke in my presence
without my permission?
Who are you?
And you were so sure
it would be almost a clean sweep.
Didn't the old fox himself
say her performance was great art?
We're not doing this for art.
We're doing it for money.
Now, listen, this can go on forever...
Some saying she is,
some saying she isn't.
Precisely. My mind is made up.
Oh, to what?
There's only one way...
To go straight to the top.
You mean the old icon?
Yes. The dowager empress.
Oh, sure. The old ramrod
Sitting in her castle
in Copenhagen biting her nails
Because she's waiting for
Sarah Bernhardt here
To give her performance.
She's the one chance.
As head of the family,
no one would dare dispute her word.
Dispute her word.
Excellency,
Her Highness would like to see you.
Her what?
Isn't she?
She can wait.
Not too long. She's packing up.
Packing up?
And where's Her Highness going?
I don't know, and it doesn't matter.
So, did you enjoy yourself today?
Yes. Until I became ashamed,
Ashamed of allowing myself
to be put on display,
Ashamed of conjuring up
tricks like a circus freak,
Ashamed of asking people
to sign papers that I am real!
I am real!
And I will not stoop
to prove it to them!
Who are they?
Who are you?
I think I know.
Today? And tomorrow?
Will you be so sure tomorrow
and the day after?
Why? Why can't you let me believe?
I will even help you believe
When I am sure of the truth myself.
No one will ever be sure,
and you least of all.
I know that today, too.
Wrong.
Those people today
were not worth your efforts,
But there is someone who is.
One word from her,
and they will all grovel.
The dowager empress, maria feodorovna.
Grandmama.
Grandmama.
Grandmama.
She'll never see me.
She will.
How do you know?
I know she will.
Words.
Call me Schemer, Plotter.
Call me what you will,
But deep down, you know that if anyone
Can get you to see that old woman,
it is I.
I'll get you there for your sake.
For my sake?
You never did anything
for the sake of anybody but yourself.
You enjoy playing with people,
making fools of them!
That's why you're doing it... as a joke!
To prove that you are great and alive
And the others are small and dead!
Yes, and for money!
Go ahead. It won't hurt.
Sit down.
If you want to leave after I am through,
I won't force you to stay.
Let us say you are right.
As a matter of fact, you are.
But that's all the more reason
for you to go with me
To the empress in Copenhagen.
Never trust anyone who functions
from noble motives.
The good are never sure,
And in the end, they'll let you down.
Our motives are different, agreed.
But our goal is the same,
And that's the only thing that counts.
Well, we'll go to Copenhagen?
I had a dream the other night.
Yes. About your father
being a ringmaster.
No. This time he was a dollmaker.
My mother, his assistant
Who painted the faces.
A correct ancestry for a puppet.
You know I'll go.
You always know.
She always wore black...
the empress... didn't she?
Yes.
For 10 years, I've wanted to see her.
She was never very easy
even before the end.
Yes, I know.
You know or you remember?
"Prince Paul." let's see...
Nephew to the empress,
second cousin to me,
Engaged to me when I was... how old?
Quite attractive.
Do you remember him?
No.
Well, you should.
I'll tell you a secret.
That first waltz you always remember...
It was with him.
Danish customs.
Have you anything to declare?
No.
Madame? Thank you.
Madame Anderson.
Madame Anderson!
Oh, yes!
Boynin. Everything in order?
Yes. It seems to be.
Welcome to Denmark.
I hope you enjoy your visit.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
I've had so many names.
It was a struggle to get you that one.
Why Aanderson?
Oh, well, you needed some name,
And once, I was in a situation with...
With a lady?
Well, as an alias,
it is innocuous enough.
"Madame A. Anderson."
The least real thing about me
Is my legal reality.
What happened to
the other Madame Anderson?
Oh, nothing very important.
You just got tired of her?
This visa is good for only 14 days.
Two weeks.
Most people have a lifetime
in which to be accepted.
Suppose two weeks are not enough?
They must be.
What's that for?
In the Calvary, we used to do it
The infantry marchin
Driver...
What is this parade?
Nothing special.
We have it every day
the king is here in Copenhagen.
Thank you.
The king?
Uncle Chris, cousin to grandmama,
the Empress.
Good. Very good.
Excuse me, sir.
Will you see Mrs. Anderson
to her rooms, please?
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, please.
Where is the bar?
That way, sir.
Well?
Not good.
Uh-uh.
The empress absolutely
refuses to see you,
Let alone her.
And him?
No. Uh-uh.
Our Prince Paul lives
on the old lady's allowance.
He was always rather courageous.
One possibility...
Remember Baroness Von Lievenbaum,
That crazy lady-in-waiting
to the empress?
Vaguely.
She remembers you clearly.
Just a moment.
You have a rendezvous
with her tomorrow at 4:oo.
Rendezvous?
Yes, at the Tivoli gardens.
It isn't! It can't be!
It is!
Elena Von Lievenbaum.
Sergei Boynin.
Do sit down.
Thank you.
No. It's too dangerous, but I will.
Dangerous? Come.
Whom could we possibly
run into here at Tivoli except
That's exactly why I chose it.
How fit you look. Superb.
But this is a stiflingly
small town... a village.
A hundred chattering tongues
Will go gossiping to Her Majesty,
"Your lady-in waiting
was seen with that man."
That man, ha.
A flagon of your delicious beer.
I always drink what the natives drink.
Oh, this is madness without the moon.
My dear baroness, you will never change.
Now you are trying to bribe me,
Just as the empress said you would.
Where is she?
The empress?
She's playing solitaire
with her memories.
No, dear general, Anastasia...
Or should I say Her Highness?
Is it really she? I long to meet her!
And so you shall,
As soon as she is properly
introduced to Copenhagen.
What a look you have.
How inevitable that I'm useless to you.
Why?
The empress will never
receive you or that woman.
You know her, an unmeltable icicle.
Thank you.
And you won't get at her
through Paul, either.
He sends her his bills
As though they were invitations.
He behaves as though
we were still in Russia.
Russia. I am all of
Chekhov's three sisters
Rolled into one.
I shall never get back there.
Surely you must have a pleasant life
with the empress
With Her Majesty,
life is one eternal glass of milk.
Oh, come. There must be some court life.
Not a crumb.
She never entertains?
Her phantoms,
the ghosts of her dead family.
But she must go out for a drive
or shopping or a muse
If you ever speak, whisper,
breathe one word...
Well, she does go out occasionally,
if there's anythi
An opera or a ballet.
Let me see.
They're performing
a ballet of Tchaikovsky's
This week at the royal theater.
Thursday, I believe.
Come over here for a moment.
I want you to look as beautiful
as possible tonight.
Oh.
He's quite a simple soul,
really... Prince Paul.
His vocation and avocation
are one in the same...
The pursuit of beautiful women.
If you thought it necessary,
I suppose you would even
To a plastic surgeon.
Take your seat.
Do you know how long it is
since I've been to a theat
Don't display too much excitement.
Sit down.
General, they just arrived.
She, too?
Yes.
Program.
Your Majesty.
The box nearest the stage.
The man you want me
to look beautiful for?
Yes.
My fiance?
The lady next to him
is Baroness Von Lievenbaum,
Lady-in-waiting to the empress.
And where's the empress?
In the back of the box,
behind the curtain.
So close after so many years.
Oh, I am suddenly frightened.
Go with them to the buffet,
and stand facing this way
Tonight can mean...
I know what tonight can mean.
Go ahead.
Uh, please, three coffees.
Have you ever seen her before?
The one with Boynin?
No.
Good evening, your Highness.
Good to see you again.
Thank you. When did you return?
Where from?
The hunting trip I was told
you were on all week.
Oh. My relations with my aunt
Forces me to be on far too many trips.
I apologize.
I understand.
Who's the lovely lady with you?
Mrs. Anderson.
Extremely lovely.
Yes, she's rather pretty.
Anderson? Is she Danish, En
Well, she's many things.
Would you like to meet her?
You know very well I woul
May I present his Highness
Prince Paul Von Herelburg.
Her Imperial Highness
Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolay
I should have known.
Traveling under the name
of Mrs. Anderson.
Surprised?
I wasn't sure I recognized you either.
But you are sure now?
Yes. I shall not
ask yet whether you are.
You're either very kind or very tactful.
My compliments.
Will you both excuse me?
You are afraid.
As a little boy, you always were.
Is it, after all, such a terrible risk
To have a drin
It seems that anything
with the general is a risk.
Even a drink.
Then have it with me.
Now it is my turn.
Will you both excuse me?
Of course.
You have changed.
So have you.
Then you do remember?
I remember a little girl
Who used to delight
backing me into a corner.
I remember a little boy
Who always took time
to make up his mind.
For example?
Ah, you're testing me?
No, prodding you to talk
so I can enjoy looking at yo
Champagne?
Why not?
Uh, the Baroness Von Lievenbaum, please.
General Boynin, Quelle surprise!
Vasili, Her Majesty would like
a glass of mineral wat
You are a monster.
Well, I've survived a revolution.
I suppose I can survive this.
Will you forgive me if
That Vasili gets
the right kind of water?
Her Majesty is madly particular.
Certainly.
Your Majesty.
Who is it?
Oh.
Your Majesty, forgive me.
I did once when I heard you'd been shot.
I was sentenced twice.
By whom? The whites or the reds?
As I recall, by both
Good for them, but you're still here.
I have asked Your Majesty's pardon.
For what? For this intrusion?
For the effrontery of
using the name of Romanov
To launch a commercial enterprise?
For hammering at my gate for days?
Your Majesty...
Boynin, I have already been
shown two Tatianas,
An Alexei, and a Maria
As well as an Anastasia.
I will not see your client.
I am as weary of
these spectral grandchildren
As I am of false hope.
I have lost everything I have loved...
My husband, my family,
my position, my country.
I have nothing but memories.
I want to be left alone
Perhaps one memory may be a reality.
The only reality for you
is an investment.
Your Majesty,
only a fool would bring you#A mere inve
Whatever you may think of me,
You must know that I am not a fool.
I, too, have gone through
the revolution into the wor
The effects of your journey
are not visible.
You know perfectly well
this woman is not my granddau
Quite honestly, I don't know who she is.
But there is so much
that cannot be explained
Unless she is the woman
she believes she is.
I see now that it mattered
more to you than I thought
I beg your pardon.
You really wanted
that title you never got.
You're not doing this simply for money.
You have never forgiven my family,
have you?
Your Majesty,
I am here simply to tell you
That whoever this woman is,
she asks only one thing...
To see you.
Unfortunately,
there are not enough years remaining
For me to see every madwoman
with a royal obsession.
If she must see me,
show her my photographs again.
Your Majesty...
Go back to Paris, Boynin.
You're wasting your time.
General!
Good evening.
Your Majesty, I thought perhaps...
Save your nonsense
So Boynin is still attractive.
Ha ha! Yes, Your Majesty.
Madly attractive!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Lievenbaum, your voluptuous
fancies are disgusting.
To a woman of your age,
sex should mean nothing but g
Yes, Your Majesty.
You saw her?
What did she say? Did she...
I did not see her. What did he say?
He was very charming.
I like him much more
Than I thought I would
from your description.
Do you?
Don't you want me to?
I want you to make him like you
more than he thought
Forgive me, Aunt Maria.
I just ran into somebody else
I forgive you.
You ran into a blonde.
Very pretty. Is she married?
Well, who is she?
I don't know yet.
Go on, you can tell me.
Lievenbaum,
I came for the other performance.
Your Majesty.
The jewels, please.
Jewels?
Yes, the jewels.
Would you put these
in the safe downstairs?
Why? They're fake.
You know that, but the manager won't.
Ah! Public relations.
Anything else?
No. See you in the morning. Good night
Good night.
You did very well tonight.
Thank you. Am I dismissed now, too?
Yes. You had better get some rest.
Prince Paul will be calling
for you tomorrow evening.
Thank you for achieving the invitation.
You achieved it. I merely accepted.
The empress doesn't want
to see me, does she?
She will see you.
I'm sure she said no tonight.
So now the route is through Paul via me.
You don't hesitate
to use anybody for anything,
Do you?
Oh, I hesitate.
I hesitate until I'm sure of
the desires of those con
Good night.
To begin with,
a nice clear champagne soup,
And then I think
a fricassee of champagne.
No vegetables.
But a crisp champagne salad.
Excellent.
And for dessert?
A small champagne souffle.
I really don't like champagne.
I only like what it do
You won't like it in the morning.
I'll adore it in the morning.
I'll have a fantastically
enormous hangover,
And your friend Boynin will be furious!
Do you know what he is?
Vodka... quick, hard, sharp. A
Champagne, I hope.
Don't be greedy.
As a little girl, you used to say that.
Oh, no. Not t
How many times have we been together?
Four, five...
Three.
Well, every time, I've heard
your mind click, click,
"is she? Isn't she? Is she?"
It's very, very unattractive of you
and very noisy.
Tonight I just want to have a good time.
Do you know who I am?
No. A woman.
An extremely attractive one.
Then behave accordingly.
Well, let's... That's difficult.
And no click, click, click.
Not a one.
Definitely.
Excuse me, your Highness.
I apologize for the intrusi

Vodka! Pure vodka!
Poor Cinderella.
The coach turned back into a pumpkin
And the footman into a big, white rat.
Your Highness.
Don't you think
the glass slipper cut her foot?
Good night, your Highness.
Oh, that ugly stepsister.
Good night. Thank you.
And thank you!
Thank you.
Pleasant dreams.
Good evening.
Ah... ah... I forgot.
My compliments to the chef.
Ha ha ha ha!
Well, good night, Boynin.
May I speak to you for a mo
It's very late.
It's very important.
All right, I enjoy her company,
And I agree she's a beautiful woman.
But the possibility
of inheriting 10 million?
Boynin, everyone is boringly
aware of my weakness and
For beauty and money.
Personally, I don't think
it's so inhuman of us.
They're the two most
desirable items in the world.
All right. What do you propose to do?
At times you push too hard.
Her visa expires in four days.
If she hasn't seen
the empress by that time...
You've been knocking
too loudly on the door, Boynin.
It is precisely when my aunt thinks
That somebody is trying to
force her to do something
That she does nothing.
When do you do something?
That depends.
On the odds?
You're pushing again.
They're high this time, my dear prince.
Very high.
Good night.
One, two...
Three, four!
General?
General, I'm hungry.
You just came from a restaurant,
didn't you?
Ha ha! That's such a funny restaurant!
No food!
Why don't you take me there tomorrow?
You had too much to drink.
No. Not quite enough.
Shall I call for some more?
No!
"No!"
It must be very dreary in your room.
Everyone in mine
Is having a wonderful time.
Would you care to join us?
Would you please stop
the nonsense and go to sleep?
Go to sleep
Plea... plea... Plea... please
General, I have a confes
I was lying.
There's no one here but me.
Can you hear me?
General!
Why don't you make a concession?
Ah... a...
I... I mean confession.
Well, it's the same thing.
Come on, general.
One little confession.
One sweet, tiny confession.
Prince Paul was asking for you twice,
Your Majesty.
Thank you, Fedev.
Good afternoon, Your Majesty.
Did Her Majesty enjoy t
Yes. It was quiet for a change.
Prince Paul...
I heard he called twice.
He's still waiting, Your Majesty.
Sorry, Your Majesty,
to be so persistent, but it is,
Money?
Much more important.
Oh. A woman.
Very well. Come in.
Well.
Who is she?
I'll come straight to the point,
your Highness.
You usually do.
Is Her Majesty back?
Yes.
Late, dear countess. Late.
Lievenbaum, I'm in no mood for you.
I had to go all the way
to town on the trolley,
On the trolley, my dear, while you...
Oh, your bursitis again.
I do not have bursitis. I ha
In the shoulder?
Another area wouldn't
surprise me as much.
Lievenbaum, enough is...
Shh!
Is there someone in there with her?
Paul.
Paul?
You know he's been seen
publicly with that woman?
Which woman?
The impostor!
Prenez Garde, Comtesse.
Perhaps the empress will acce
You mean he's going to talk her into it?
She's getting old.
Never!
Never! And lonely
And she...
Never!
Lievenbaum!
Your Majesty?
Do you know what he wanted?
I can imagine, Your Majesty.
To receive that woman!
How easily he swallows
the tricks she performs.
And what do they prove?
That she can memorize
the teachings of Boynin.
What if there is a resemblance?
What if she does think she is Anastasia?
Wanting a dream does not make it true.
She's a fraud. She must be.
Well, isn't she?
I...
Don't know, Your Majesty.
You all think I'm stubborn, don't you?
I am.
Very stubborn.
Perhaps too stubborn.
At what hotel is she staying?
"Believe me, I really tried.
My sincere regrets."
Sincere! Signed, "Paul."
Miserable handwriting.
You think he really saw the empress?
What's the difference whether he did
And she refused, or whether he didn't?
The answer is the same for us... no.
Hello.
Yes.
And who?
Thank you.
Baroness Von Lievenbaum is
on her way up with a lady.
What lady?
I think you'd better go inside,
both of you.
Lady?
Do you think it is...
Yes, I do.
Petrovin, come!
Who is on the way up?
I think the empress.
She's coming here? Now?
I don't think I'll be able to face her.
Don't be a fo
No, I'm not well enough. Must it be now?
If I only could have some time...
Get ready.
Your Majesty.
Wait downstairs, Lievenbaum.
I am deeply grateful, Your Majesty.
I hope that you won't allow
your opinion of me to int
Bring her in!
Your Highness, Her Majesty's waiting.
Courage.
Yes.
The resemblance is quite good enough
For a waxworks gallery.
Don't you recognize me?
Should I?
Who are you? Where were you born?
My birth certificate says Tsarskoe Selo,
But I was really born in Peterhof.
Daughter, no doubt,
to Tsar Nicholas II and alexandra
And granddaughter to Maria Feodorovna,
Dowager Empres
I have received too many appeals
from resurrected Rom
The firings squads were such poor shots,
It's amazing the revolution succeeded.
Twice I started off to find you, but...
There were so many days,
weeks, even months
When I didn't know who I was.
And now you do?
I thought I did,
but if you don't know me...
Have I changed so much, Your Majesty?
One does not change, mademoiselle.
No.
Not if one is loved.
Perhaps if love had not been
cut off so abruptly,
I would not have changed so much.
You are making vulgar
and sentimental use
Of an episode which is for me
a great personal sorrow
Forgive me.
I forgot for a moment that
you would regard that trag
As more yours than mine.
Oh, I'm trying,
But you're making it
very difficult for me, grandmama
I did not give you permission
to call me that!
I'm sorry.
You think a lonely old woman
Should be eager to hear
someone call her grandmama?
My loneliness has been
as sharp as yours.
We are, most of us, lonely,
And it is mostly of our own making,
But no masquerade of any kind
can fill the emptiness.
You asked me for recognition.
You do it well.
Your eyes are moist,
your voice blurred with feeling.
I believe you are lonely
and you want love.
Who does not?
But the love you beg from me
belongs to one who is de
Are you so sure?
You have won the endorsement
of the sentimental,
The greedy... I am none of those.
So you shut me out
before you even opened that door.
I was told you would
ask me difficult questions,
And you are not even
interested enough to ask me one.
No, I am not interested in
a demonstration of the tri
Taught to you
by your business associates.
But I care nothing about their business.
I care nothing about the money!
Ah, but you know of the inheritance.
I know what they told me.
I don't want money.
Tell me to whom it should be given,
and I'll give it.
Easily said, but you cannot
give it away until you ha

without first obtaining my reco
It's useless to say that
that is not what I want.
You're so hard.
I remember hearing father say that

I thought at the time that
that was a very strong wor
Just because you
and my mother were quarreling
Over a necklace.
Some... some emeralds, yes.
You wanted to keep them though
They belonged to the imperial treasury.
Who told you that?
Oh, there were many
who could have known.
You wore them
with your last court dress,
Green and gold velvet and a long train.
The photograph was unflattering
but accurate.
My father took my mother's side
in the quarrel.
There they were,
all of them against you,
But you were stubborn.
You kept Figgy's emeralds.
How did you learn to call
Catherine the great Figgy?
We always called her that.
Sometimes we gave the nickname to Maria
Because she had such an eye for the men,
And Olga used to say...
Stop!
I forbid you to bandy those names!
I can speak of them if I choose.
They are my sisters.
Impostor!
You call me that?
If you have any decency,
end this charade at once!
I will pay you.
I will give you more than
whatever Boynin...
Go away!
I'm offering you money.
Please go.
So you are giving up.
So it wasn't enough
I suffered the asylum,
Some people trying me,
using me, rejecting me!
And before that
the cellar and the flight.
The rescue from the very edge
of the grave?
Years of lost memory in an asylum?
Excellent material for melodrama.
Long, empty days in which
the consciousness of living
Came only through pain.
Hardly melodrama.
And then slowly, finally struggling up
Out of the water into the light,
into the air, thinki
Yes, perhaps, yes...
I may be...
I must be...
I am.
I am and my grandmother is still
alive to tell me so!
My grandmother is alive
to hold out her hand full of
The tragic scene of despair.
Well done.
You're forgetting nothing, are you?
I am sorry, mademoiselle,
that your failure to win me
Is such a cruel disappointment.
Good-bye.
Oh, don't go!
But you just told me to.
I promise I will not say anything more
to try and con
Then what do you want of me?
A moment or two longer.
a moment more to be with you,
To pretend you do not think what you do,
To close my eyes
and pretend it is years ago...
A terrace in the summer sun.
No... no, no! I promise.
I promise I will not
say names or places.
The smell of the sea air,
the sound of a tennis ball,
The laughter from the courts
behind the trees
And your voice calling me Malenkaya.
And then the sudden...
Lightning in the summer sk... sky.
Are you ill?
I was, but I'm not now.
Have you seen a doctor? A good one?
I'm well acquainted with doctors,
but it is kind of y
I'd better go.
I'm really not surprised that
you do not recognize me
I have changed very much, indeed.
You asked for just one moment.
What is strange is that
you have changed so little.
It is as though the horror
of all these last years
Has only made you stronger.
I am not strong, mademoiselle.
Let me go.
You are too clever for me.
I'm an old woman.
My strength is only outward now.
At least we met again.
And we will another time
when my mind is clearer.
But now...
No, we better not meet again.
You have softened towards me,
But later you'll regret
You'll say it was all acting.
She was some cheap little actress
they hired for mone
And... in a way, they did hire me.
I was starving
after I ran from the last asylum.
I had nowhere to go.
Boynin found me
on the bank of the seine.
Maybe there is more good
to him than we think,
Or maybe I should have
run away from him, too,
But I was so tired of running.
Are you all right?
Yes. And if it is better
for you not to believe...
You are ill.
No. I cough only
because I'm a little frightened.
It doesn't mean...
Say that again.
That I cough when I'm frightened?
When you were a little girl,
you coughed when you wer
Malenkaya.
Malenkaya.
You have come from so far away,
and I've waited so lo
No, no, no. Don't cry.
There's no need to be frightened.
Don't speak. You are safe, Anastasia.
You are with me. You're home.
The phantoms can go.
The closed rooms can be opened.
You know, I have a footman
who is a very old man,
And each night,
he goes from one room to the other,
Lighting the empty lamps
until the great, dark rooms
Are a blaze of light.
Perhaps that is true of all of us.
We are lighting dead lamps
To illumine a past that is gone.
I thought you were gone,
but you have come back, Anas
You have come back.
But, oh, please...
If it should not be you,
don't ever tell me.
Many beautiful shops and restaurants.
Yes.
Also, we might make
a small trip to America.
After all, it's the only country left
With proper respect for wealth.
I hate trips.
I would like to go to Uruguay.
Yes? Why?
I like the name... Uruguay.
I hate it.
And Guatemala. They sound so far away.
Yes, very.
Why don't you charter a boat
And sail the high seas?
I hate the sea.
My dear maxim, you are here to eat,
Drink, enjoy the show,
and have a good time.
I hate Russian food.
I hate bad champagne.
I'm sick of those gypsies,
and I'm having a terrible
Then why don't you go home?
I hate my room even more.
So soon?
Hey, he's back from the station.
Maybe she's not on the train.
Maybe.
Anything wrong? Did you meet the train?
She was on it?
The Empress? Paul?
Well?
Everything is up...
Go powder your nose.
How long should I take?
We'll call you. Go on. Go on.
Well, Petrovanch,
They all arrived.
Then why isn't he at the hotel with her?
Yes. Probably it is Copenhagen
all over again.
I said he should have stayed there.
"Stayed there." but the empress
Would not let him see Her Highness,
Or at least that's what Paul said.
No. It was wasting money to stay.
Von Lievenbaum is expecting you
at 10:00 in the morni
You mean they agreed
To the presentation ceremony
tomorrow night? Wonderfu
Then we can have
the press conference at 7:3o.
In the grand ballroom of their hotel.
Good.
What about the marriage rumors?
Yes. You will announce
her engagement to Paul?
You know, every time Paul is mentioned,
He gets peculiar.
You don't think he's getting jealous?
Yes. I began to think back
in Copenhagen.
You're eating like a pig again.
I'm nervous again.
Where the devil did that come from?
The opera warehouse.
I think it is very impressive.
Fran, get rid of those lights.
What time is it?
The press has already been
waiting for her.
Too late to do anything
about that throne.
For heaven's sakes,
stop that nonsense. Petrovin.
But they are rehearsing.
They rehearse later.
Please, gentlemen. Please.
After the press conference
I am confused. Confused!
When we originally discussed the pres...
Stepal, tell Her Highness we're ready.
Petrovin, let the press in.
Did you see her? Did you talk to her?
Chernov, I told you 5o times,
I have not seen her
nor him nor the empress.
Perhaps if I write it
very carefully in very big lett
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm bored with the whole business.
The sooner it's over with, the better.
You certainly have changed, Excellency,
But don't get too bored.
It is a little too late.
This way, please.
You'll find copies of the guest lis
And other information on this table.
Yes. This is the very room
In which the presentation
ceremony will take place
Later this evening.
Ladies and gentlemen, I regret
you cannot be present
But such is the wish
of Her Imperial Majesty,
The dowager empress.
However, Her Imperial Highness,
The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna,
Has most graciously consented
to see you for just a f
At 9:30, the ball will be opened
by the grand duchess
And his Highness
Prince Paul Von Herelburg.
At 10: 15...
Is it true they're going to be married?
Will the engagement
be announced tonight?
Well, unofficially and off the record...
At the present time,
there's no information
On that subject. Proceed.
At 10: 15, the dowager empress
will make her appearanc
At 10:20,
The Russian national anthem
will be played,
And Her Majesty
will formally present her...
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my humble pleasure
To present Her Imperial Highness,
The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna.
What a beautiful dress.
Get a picture of
her coming down the stairs.
Peter, the flash.
We'll get some more in a minute.
What is it?
Extraordinary taste.
Can we get a picture on the thro
Her Highness has not fully
recovered from her long il
So I must request that you be
As brief as possible
with your questions.
Your Highness, is it true that it is
Very difficult for you
to get to see the empress?
I was three weeks in Copenhagen,
Almost all of which
I spent with Her Majesty.
Are you going to marry Prince Paul?
I found the city extremely
charming and hospitable.
What about the inheritance,
Your Highness?
How do you plan to spend it?
Will you get the whole 1
If I should receive an inheritance,
It will be more of a surprise
to me than to you.
Did you go to Romania
After you escaped from Russia?
Yes.
Where you in a hospital in Bucharest
in December 1920
Yes, I was in a hospital in Bucharest.
When, I do not remember precisely.
Don't you? I do.
I was convalescing in the next ward
when they brought
It is possible.
Possible, but you don't remember?
Well, when they discharged you,
A man was waiting for you
and took you home...
Me.
General, I beg you. We cannot...
Quiet.
What is your name?
Mikhail Vladoss.
Vladoss.
And yours is Anna Corev.
Corev? Is that true?
Yes. I have used that name.
Her Highness has used many names.
As you all know,
she has been forced to hide.
Also, she has suffered amnesia.
Please. Mikhail Vlado
Yes. We were in the same hospital
in Bucharest.
They treated you for head wounds.
They did.
Which you got in a train explosion
outside Bucharest.
Were you in a train wreck?
Are you Anna Corev?
Please, I would like to answer.
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
Please.
Her Highness cannot hear your questions,
Let alone an
What is it you wish to know?
Whether I was wounded in a train
explosion on the way
Were you?
I remember being in a train explosion.
Whether or not I was wounded,
I do not know.
Where did you get the wounds?
In Russia or in Buchare
Is it not possible to
have been wounded twice?
In a war, maybe.
What else is a revolution?
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
The interview is ove
Oh. Oh.
Stepal, make sure that there are men
posted at every
To keep the reporters from the guests,
And check every invitation at the door.
Yes, sir.
I don't make things
easier for you, do I?
Was it a disaster?
No matter what the papers print,
Before they can be o
The guests will be here
And the empress will have
made the presentation.
Oh, forgive me. May I?
You may even give me one.
Thank you.
The stairs aren't doing
that dress any good.
It doesn't matter.
It will in an hour.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
And you missed me terribly.
I missed you, yes.
Whose orders kept you from seeing me...
The Empress'
Apparently, it has never occurred to you
That I can function
without orders from anyone.
Then you didn't want to see me. Why?
I thought it better not to.
Then the marriage rumors are true.
You yourself told me that Paul and I
were engaged yea
Aren't you taking your royal duties
a bit too serious
Independently, you mean.
The puppet has pulled
the strings herself.
This is childish.
You've always had an obsession
That people want you to do
only what they tell you.
No, not people. You.
Nonsense.
Is it?
You pushed me at Paul,
And now you're against him. Wh
Are you afraid that
he's going to be in control?
Over what?
Over me. Over the money.
I don't give a hang about the money.
Then what is bothering you?
That I might be Anna Core
I don't care what your name is.
I care what you are.
What bothers me
is the way you've changed.
I'm the one who has changed.
Yes. When we began, you merely
wanted to find out who
You said that was all you wanted.
But is it?
No.
Now you must be
the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayev
Now you must be placed upon a throne
Before a morgue of royal corpses.
Must you always hate?
Must you always ridicule?
Ridicule who?
Your loyal, loving subjects?
Those embalmed skeletons?
They don't care about you.
They don't care who is Anastasia
So long as they can get some money
and a better posit
In a world that is dead
and buried and should be!
You didn't say that a month ago.
Then you wanted it f
Well, now I like it.
Go on. Like it. Be a grand duchess,
and make it reall
And marry a man who wouldn't
come within 1o feet of t
If you were not an heiress.
Oh, the truth is insulting.
You told me once that
I was selfish and ambitious,
And I admitted that you were right.
Why don't you now have the courage
To admit that I am
Remember?
What?
The music. This waltz.
Yes, of course.
No. You don't really.
Sorry. Should I?
No. It was a long time ago.
My first waltz. My first ball.
My first...
What?
Partner.
I thought it was you.
It must have been somebody else.
It might have been me.
It really doesn't matter.
It might not have even been at the ball.
Frankly, I don't understand you.
Why? Because I didn't
deny what Vladoss said?
How do you know that
I am not Anna Corev?
Be serious.
I am.
You're deliberately behaving
very strangely tonight.
How do you know how Anna Corev behaves?
I know how you behave,
And all I care about is you.
Do you mean that?
Of course.
Then let's announce
our engagement tonight.
I want to very much.
Prince Paul Von Herelburg
to Miss Anna Corev.
Will you announce that?
Certainly not, because it's n
No? Suppose I have no title,
no inheritance, nothing.
I can't suppose that
When I know perfectly well who y
Still, what if I can't get the money,
Or if I make no claim to it?
You can, and you will.
Why be poor when you can
so easily be very rich?
The poor have only one advantage...
They know when they are loved
for themselves.
Sorry, but I refuse to take
that remark seriously.
The empress is ready.
She's upstairs in the green roo
Good.
It's almost time.
All right.
Oh, Petrovanch,
should I not be back in time...
Why not?
Just go ahead without me.
Sergei Pavlovich, isn't this all superb?
I have never seen you look so well.
In this? Oh, ha ha ha.
They don't know
how to make baggage nowadays.
Imagine trying to fit this
Into a nasty little modern
The times aren't suited for elegance,
But you have brought it back ce soir.
What's the matter? You look upset.
No. Just tired.
Would you ask Her Majesty
If she would receive me
for just a moment?
You know I will.
General.
General.
You may go in.
That's very kind of you.
But just in case,
she's heard about the reporters.
Thank you.
Vasili, Her Majesty
is expecting the general.
I was going to send for you, Boynin.
My granddaughter tells me to expect
Some unpleasantness in the newspapers.
I'm afraid so, Your Majesty.
Thank you. The man
was probably a hired troublemaker.
Well, Her Highness says that actually...
I am aware w
Unfortunately, she is not aware
That truth serves
only a world that lives by it.
I have prepared
a statement for the press
That I want you to give to them
before you leave toni
I am leaving now, Your Majesty.
Why?
I feel that my work is finished...
Satisfactorily, I trust.
Since this is your evening,
I felt it my duty...
No. That isn't quite true.
I simply wanted to say good-bye to you.
Extraordinary.
You want to leave before the spectacle.
I should have thought
no one would watch it
With more triumph than you.
If the evening belongs to anyone,
it is to you.
We are all grateful.
Thank you, Your Majesty,
but I want no further part i
Come. After all,
you've performed an enormous task.
You've restored my granddaughter
to her rightful posi
And unless I have been misinformed,
You even effected her reunion
with her childhood swee
Yes. To a degree, I suppose I did.
But you're not particularly
pleased with it, are you?
Your Majesty...
You're not pleased. Why not?
But I am not in a position...
Oh, come. After all,
it's extremely unlike you
To speak of position, Boynin.
When I am with Your Majesty,
I'm deeply aware of it.
Thank you. Then I request you answer.
If it is what Her Highness
the grand duchess really d
Why, then, I must be pleased,
but for myself, no, I a
We should not only
have given you that title,
We should have made you an ambassador.
How deviously you have arrived
at what you wanted to
And even now, you don't say it.
You have not given me
even a piece of string
To hang you with.
Sergei Pavlovich,
what do you wish to ask?
Why do you try to ask me?
Why have you not asked her?
Often what is difficult for others
is simple for me,
But what has always been
the simplest for others
Is impossible for me.
I made the attempt, Your Majesty,
But it became translated into anger.
You are less of a knave than I thought,
But very much more of a fool.
Yes?
Excuse me, Your Majesty. It's time.
So soon?
Boynin, I want you to wait for me here.
This time, it is a command.
Will you?
Yes, Your Majesty, I will.
Your Majesty, I cannot wait for you
to look down into
You'll weep absolute tears.
Everyone's there,
and the gowns and the uniforms.
It's incredibly like it used to be.
Yes. I can smell the mothballs.
Your Imperial Majesty, I beg you...
Mmm... Excuse me.
If Your Majesty will permit me
to explain the ceremon
Lievenbaum.
We discussed the ceremony this morning.
Yes, but...
The "but" we'll discuss later.
Yes, baroness.
How lovely you are.
Are you having a good time?
Yes, grandmama.
Where is Paul?
He's dancing with
the princess of Falkanburg.
He dances very well.
Yes, very well.
And he's very handsome.
Yes, he's handsome.
Your Majesty, a thousand apologies...
If they have waited 10 years,
They should not mind
waiting 10 minutes more.
Lievenbaum, I want to speak to
my granddaughter alone
Out, gentlemen. Out.
Where is Boynin?
It's just like him to disappear
When he is really needed.
All right, ladies, count.
Lievenbaum, that gentleman
you are so fond of,
See that he does not
leave the green room.
Yes, Your Majesty.
They're whirling in delight down there.
Yes.
Come here.
Let me put it on for you.
Are you that tired of it already?
It's just that I'm not used to one.
It takes time.
Are you sure about Paul?
Why...
I-I like him very much.
Why do you stammer?
I was surprised
by the suddenness of the question.
If you love, the answer is always ready.
I've been asked to announce
your engagement tonight.
Are you sure you want me to?
I want to marry.
Why?
I suppose I want the belonging,
the closeness.
Am I selfish?
No. Do you want all this with Paul?
I think it would please you, grandmama,
And anything that would please
you would please me.
Do you know you're talking
exactly like Boynin?
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Anastasia Nikolayevna,
you don't really want to marry
I don't know.
You do know,
Because you really want someone else.
Do I?
Maybe.
Except that all this time,
The only thing I thought
I really wanted was you.
That you already have,
and it's not enough,
Nor should it be.
No one can blame me for living
with my dear phantoms,
But you, you must find the things
From which other women
make their happiness.
Sit here for just one moment longer.
Lievenbaum says things
are just as they used to be
Down in the ballroom.
She's foolish.
The world moves on, Malenkaya,
and we must move on wi
Or be left to molder with the past.
I am the past. I like it.
It's sweet and familiar,
and the present is cold and
And the future...
Unfortunately, I don't need to concern
Myself with that, but you do.
It's yours.
Unfasten this for me, will you, please?
Figgy's emeralds?
Yes. I want to give them to you.
Grandmama, you have given me
What no one else in the world could...
Myself.
Thank you.
Here. Here.
You'd better fix it yourself.
Go into the green room.
Lievenbaum will help you.
Yes, grandmama.
Hurry. There's not much time.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
Yes? What is it?
I thought you'd like to know
That the gentleman
no longer waits alone.
Good.
I suppose we shall have to
go on with the performance
Bring in the jesters.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Baroness.
Oh, Your Majesty, I beg you.
We cannot keep them waiting any longer.
May we proceed now?
Yes, yes, proceed.
Oh, uhh... The musicians?
All arranged, sir.
Good.
Take your position by the curtains.
Yes, sir.
And straighten your tie.
And, your Excellency,
please, don't forget,
All the names loud, strong, clear.
Don't worry.
Oh, thank you, your Excellency.
Ladies, get ready.
Where is, uhh...
Where is Prince Paul?
I've told you twice. He's comin
And three times you've told me
You cannot find Boynin
I also told you that he said...
To go ahead without h
I say there is something
unbalanced with him tonight,
And the sooner we...
Oh, your Highness.
Your Majesty.
I've never seen
you look like this before.
I have never felt like this before.
It is time.
Petrovin, would you be so kind
As to inform Her Imperial Highness,
the Grand Duchess
That we are ready?
Right away.
Hurry.
Baroness, the procedure,
Just to refresh your memory
As to what we discussed this morning.
You think my mind is failing?
Ha ha ha! Baron...
Ladies and gentlemen,
there will be a... drum roll.
After that, Her Imperial Majesty,
The Dowager Empress, will come forward,
And when she passes
through the curtains...
The orchestra will strike up
our national anthem.
After that, the grand duchess is...
She has gone!
Gone where? What is he talking about?
She's not there. I looked all over.
That is impossible.
I mean, she must be...
Silence.
You have looked in the green room?
Yes, Your Majesty.
There is no one there.
No one.
Perhaps she went to her room.
You won't find her.
It's a waste of time.
They've both gone.
Both?
She and your friend Boynin.
But why? I don't understand.
You never did.
You mean the others were right?
She was not Anastasia after all.
Wasn't she?
Your Majesty, I beg you.
They're all waiting down there.
What can we say to them?
Nothing.
Paul, your arm.
I will speak to them.
Oh, thank you, Your Majesty.
Everybody, please.
Forgive me, Aunt Maria,
but what will you say?
Say?
Oh, I will say, "the play is over.
Go home."
