- Did you contact Miss Alden?
- Not yet.
- Any appointments?
- Doctor Alezais at 4.
He' s called three times to confirm.
He sounds like he' s over 100.
If you want to cancel,
you' ll have to do it yourself.
I was just boiling water for tea.
Perhaps you will join me. Come.
- I won' t take much of your time.
- Take. I am not a busy man.
You were bitten by a wolf
in Vermont on March 8th.
Very auspicious.
- Very suspicious?
- Auspicious. Very auspicious.
March 8th. The moon was the closest
it' s been to earth in 100 years.
Well... that is auspicious.
What I' m curious about is...
Could my symptoms be caused by
chemicals released from a wolf bite?
Something that medical science
has overlooked.
Among my people there is only
one explanation for your symptoms.
That you are becoming a wolf.
But... you don' t believe that...
Why not?
Remember, man has only been
out of the jungle for 25,000 years.
Please, sit down.
Life is mystical.
lt' s just that we are used to it.
Catholicism itself.
A religion so mystical -
- that even primitive tribes
can be converted to it.
The return after death.
Judgement Day, Heaven and Hell.
All so incredible and so ordinary.
But we are used to it.
- Honey, sugar, Sweet N'  Low?
- Anything. Honey.
I don' t have honey.
Visit a shaman.
He' ll tell you the rules.
I can only tell you the theory.
- Do you know any of the rules?
- Very few.
The wolf rests by day
and prowls by night.
But he' s always present.
He grows inside a man he' s entered
until the first full moon.
Then he consumes him. Killing
all but his nature and his heart.
Not a great prognosis.
Of course.
not all who are bitten change.
There must be something wild within.
An analogue of the wolf.
Among my people, l' m not known
for having an analogue of a wolf.
Your people are wrong. Sometimes
one doesn' t even need to be bitten.
Only the passion of the wolf
is enough.
Dr. Alezais...
I' d like to know...
Not that I subscribe to this...
Neither do I.
Only to the possibility.
But out of curiosity...
Is there supposed to be any way
to stop this metamorphosis?
Supposedly there are herbs
and rites and amulets.
I don' t know the rites.
I don' t have the herbs.
But I did find something
for you when you called.
This is one
of the most powerful amulets.
It must be worn next to the skin
and never taken off.
If it works, there is said to be
great pain and weakness.
The wolf struggles to emerge,
and the charm holds him at bay.
I have no idea if any of it is true,
but it' s yours.
It' s a gift.
And in return
I would like a favour from you.
If it' s in my power.
I was recently told that I am dying.
Speaking of mystical
and terrifying experiences.
I would like you to bite me.
- What?
- I would like you to bite me.
I can' t ask you to transform me
with your passions.
But I ask you to honour me
with your bite.
I, too, will become a demon wolf.
You' d rather be damned than die?
Damnation is not a part
of my system of beliefs.
The demon wolf is not evil
unless the man he' s bitten is evil.
And it feels good to be a wolf,
doesn' t it?
Power without guilt.
Love without doubt.
Excuse me, I just can' t.
I understand.
Keep the amulet.
If you decide to believe, -
- perhaps
you will give me your gift.
It has been a privilege.
I' ve never seen one like you.
- Hello?
- I' ve been trying to call...
Don' t hang up.
Let me explain.
I' m not a fan of men
who mysteriously disappear.
I had an accident.
I sleepwalked last night.
I hit my head. I drove
to the doctor' s at 6 o' clock.
But you didn' t come and tell me?
No, it was 6 o' clock in the morning
and I had a scalp wound.
I didn' t want you
to take care of me again.
Finish drying yourself.
The towel' s driving me crazy.
Can you hear that?
Yes, it' s one of my new gifts.
Laura, please... can I see you?
Can we have dinner tomorrow?.
I' m at the Mayflower.
Laura?
I' ll be there tomorrow at six.
You' d better look like you fell.
I do!
Room 825. What did you...
... make me for breakfast?
I' m not only the president
of the Hair Club for Men. -
- I' m also a member.
Hold it right there.
Put your hands on the cage.
Spread your legs.
He' s clean.
Put your hands behind your back.
- Did you see that?
- He got my cuffs.
- Wait up!
- Have you got any money?
- Loan us some money.
- All of you?
Yeah...
I' ve got about $1,000 in my wallet.
How much would you like to borrow?
Give me the wallet.
Morning, this is Alice
with your 8 o' clock wake up.
You must have been bad last night
I' ve been ringing you forever.
As a matter of fact, Alice,
I was a very good boy last night.
I went to bed...
... so early,
I don' t even remember.
- Big boys here yet?
- Conference room. Deal in hand.
Don' t even pretend
to have any doubts.
It' s a pleasure
doing business with you, sir.
Will... I talked to Mr. Alden
about your consultant position.
It' s less pay of course,
but so is Eastern Europe.
Thanks, but I' ve had a better offer.
- Really? What house?
- This one.
- I don' t understand...
- I did the same thing you did.
I nagged Alden
until he gave me your job.
- When? I don' t understand.
- In my spare time.
I guess I owe you
some congratulations.
I guess the best man won.
I' m glad in a way.
I couldn' t have given it up.
And I didn' t like the way I got it.
I hope we can work together
without rancour.
You' re fired. Stewart.
Don' t, Will. lt' ll ruin me.
I know, but it' s best for the firm.
Give me a few months.
Let me say I quit.
No.
It wouldn' t be best for the firm.
You vindictive son of a bitch!
The best thing for the firm is me.
I' m the best thing this firm has,
and you fucking know it!
- Are you crazy?
- No.
I' m just marking my territory,
and you got in the way.
Nice.
Real nice.
- Suede shoes.
- Asparagus.
Will...
Please, can I talk to you
for a moment?
A moment of your time for 16 years.
That' s pretty cheap.
- What do you want?
- I want to come back.
I have no excuse. I deserve
anything you do to me.
I' m just begging you to be kind.
Has Stewart become unlovable
now that he' s out of my job?
I never loved Stewart.
It was a mistake. Will.
I' m going to talk to him.
Stewart never for one moment
meant anything to me.
And you think that makes it better?
You betrayed me with a man -
- that meant nothing to you?
You betrayed me for nothing.
- Don' t be so smug.
- Don' t touch me.
Keep away.
Hi, I thought I' d just come on up.
Have you been waiting for me?
I can' t see you.
Open the door.
You can' t do this to me twice.
Open it!
I wonder
if you could do me a favour...
- Please go.
- Why? What happened?
What have you done?
Where did you get those?
I want you to go.
No.
- Tell me why you' ve done this.
- lt' s getting late.
I think I' m dangerous,
especially at night.
You' re afraid that
when it gets dark, you' ll attack me?
Yeah.
I think I' m turning into...
something else.
Into the thing that bit you?
Into the wolf?
- Tell me where the key is.
- I don' t have a key.
I don' t even know
where l got the handcuffs.
You don' t have a key?
What was your plan? To sit chained
to the radiator until you grew paws?
God... you almost make this seem
like it isn' t happening.
I don' t have a plan.
I didn' t think past
not hurting anyone.
- I don' t think I can open these.
- You don' t know about me.
When you' re a druggie
and a delinquent, -
- and you want to get Daddy,
you get arrested.
You come into contact with
the criminal element of society.
You pick up shit you think
you' re never going to need.
Then one day you meet a guy
who chains himself to the radiator.
Why do you want
any of this nightmare?
You mean instead of the gaiety
of my normal life?
I don' t know.
Because I like you.
Because you' re a good man.
And that' s very exotic to me.
I never thought I' d meet a good man
who looked at me the way you do.
- You don' t know I' m a good man.
- Yes. I do.
Then why is this happening?
I thought only the evil were cursed.
No, not at all.
I could' ve told you that.
The worst things
happen to the best people.
I almost had it.
You might consider -
- that you' re not cursed at all,
that you' re sick.
There are brain tumours
that can cause all of your symptoms.
Tumours? What are you saying?
Are you serious?
- Yeah.
- God, if only that could be true.
How we lower our sights.
I say we get you examined
for physical causes, -
- before we take for granted
that you' re becoming...
There we go. On your feet.
Let' s get you re-handcuffed.
- Maybe it isn' t necessary.
- Hands behind your back.
There.
You seem pretty helpless now.
- Yes.
- Great.
Interesting. What is it?
- It' s a good luck charm.
- Really?
Does it work?
Well.
today isn' t turning out too bad.
- Laura...
- Yes?
Nothing... not a thing.
- Who is it?
- Police.
Detective Sergeant Bridger, NYPD.
- Is William Randall here?
- Why? What' s wrong?
- I' d rather tell Mr. Randall.
- He' s in the shower.
Is it okay if I come in and wait?
There' s... some kind of a problem.
I understand. I' m Will Randall.
I' m renting the apartment.
About the noise last night...
He' s not the hotel manager.
He' s a police detective.
Could we talk in private?
That won' t be necessary.
This is Miss Smith, my fiancee.
She can hear anything
that you have to say.
Your wife
was found dead this morning.
I' m sorry.
She was murdered last night.
Her body was found in the park.
- How was she killed?
- Her throat was torn out.
- Sit down.
- No... I want to stand up.
Would you mind telling me
when you saw your wife last?
Last night, here in the lobby.
- About six.
- Did you argue?
- Don' t answer anything else, Will.
- I' m trying to get the facts.
The clerk said
Mr. Randall and his wife had argued.
So you already know they argued.
These are not straight questions.
Could I ask about Mr. Randall' s
whereabouts last night?
Mr. Randall was with me last night.
I arrived at 6:30 and didn' t leave.
Check that with the desk.
I will.
We' ve taken some blood and tissue
samples from your... the victim.
It would really help if you
would submit some samples...
- Not without a court order.
- Just a request.
Here' s my number.
In case you want to reach me.
I' d like you to come down
to the station and give a statement.
- Both of you.
- All right.
Thank you for your cooperation.
He' s got an alibi.
The girl says she was with him.
- Airtight?
- It depends on who the girl is.
Charlotte Randall was wife of the
senior editor of MacLeish House, -
- recently purchased
by Raymond Alden.
Police have no suspects in custody
at this time.
- My God!
- I hope they don' t go after Will.
Why should they?
He' s the husband
and they were separated.
It wouldn' t be great for the stock.
It could be a bonanza for the stock.
The heat, the gossip.
- That' s what publishing' s about.
- Well, you handle it.
You' re back in marketing.
Thank you, sir.
If they do go after Will, -
- and I hope that they don' t,
I' d like to bid again for the job.
Randall has the right
to name his own replacement.
He' s named Roy Macallister.
I see.
Would that contract hold
if Will was arrested?
Yes, unless he' s convicted. You' ll
have to keep your fingers crossed.
- I didn' t mean...
- Really? What did you mean?
I hope to God Will is innocent.
And if he is. screw the job.
But if he' s guilty...
screw Roy Macallister.
It' s not much farther now.
- What if I killed her?
- What if you killed her?
Are you the guy I spent the night
with? You look so much like him.
I could have gone out
after you fell asleep.
Why does it always
have to be the worst news?
The worst pain?
The worst defeat?
- Because... what if it is?
- It' s not!
It' s not.
They' ve left the hotel.
The night clerk identified the girl.
She' s Laura Alden.
How' s that for an alibi?
- Where are we?
- We' re almost home.
Jesus! Where did the day go?
You' d better duck down.
- Hi. Miss Alden.
- Hi, George.
Stay down.
Hi. Tom.
Be careful of the woods.
There are some wild dogs.
- What do you mean?
- We found a deer they killed.
Thanks. I' ll be careful.
Goodnight.
I want you to lock me up
before it gets dark.
- Then what?
- Then maybe it won' t happen.
I don' t know where else to put you
but the barn.
- Everything else has windows.
- The barn sounds good.
The barn sounds great.
I' m gonna beat this, Laura.
I' m gonna beat this.
Your phone is ringing.
- How do you know?
- I can hear it.
I' ll be right back.
- Hello?
- Laura Alden?
- This is Detective Bridger.
- I know who you are.
- And we now know who you are.
- How long have you been ringing?
About two minutes, but l' ve been
trying to reach you all day.
Tomorrow you' ll give me
the statement I asked for.
All right. Do you still want blood
and tissue samples from Mr. Randall?
They' d be useless.
We' ve messed up the samples
we took from the body.
What happened?
There was canine DNA
in all the tissue samples.
The victim could have been mauled
after she was killed.
Or maybe one of the lab assistants
had been petting her dog.
You scared me.
You were right.
The phone was ringing.
It was that detective. Bridger.
He traced me and now
he' s threatening to subpoena me -
- if I don' t give him
a statement tonight.
Will you be all right if I go in?
Yes.
Don' t look so scared.
Maybe there' s happy endings even for
people who don' t believe in them.
I want you to know something.
I' ve never loved anybody this way.
I' ve never looked at a woman
and thought:
If the world ends, I' ll still
understand what God meant -
- if I' m with her.
Laura Alden' s coming in tonight.
It sounds like she' s been crying.
I just got a call from
Randall' s best friend.
- He wants to see me tonight.
- We' ve got a busy night.
The the family of a kid who got
his fingers torn off is out there.
- What is there about a full moon?
- More light.
If a rich, white boy had his fingers
torn off, they' d do something.
- Laura Alden for Mr. Bridger.
- He' s running behind.
- Miss Alden, take my seat.
- No.
- Please.
- No. I want to stand.
You don' t know me. Stewart Swinton.
I' m a friend of Will Randall' s.
I know who he is...
Well, I know his name.
This is a terrible thing.
I' m in shock over it.
Will was more than a friend,
he was my mentor.
- And you were his protege?
- Yes. a better word.
It' s a true pleasure.
A very interesting scent you have.
At once new, and familiar.
Very familiar.
Thank you.
- Were you bitten?
- What?
What a very odd question.
What made you ask such a question?
I don' t know... When people
are bitten,  it' s often on the hand.
Why are you here?
They want some information
about the publishing house.
Stewart Swinton!
Come on in.
Will you have a drink with me?
I' ll tell you all about Will.
Thank you, that' s very sweet.
I' d love to.
Wonderful.
- Don' t break our date now.
- I won' t.
This is not easy. Will Randall
was a very dear friend of mine.
I' m not proud of what
I' m going to say.
Charlotte Randall and I...
This is hard.
Charlotte Randall and I were
having an affair. It just happened.
And Will found out.
- Yes.
- Will there be anyone else?
There will only be the two of us.
I' ll be flying with a sick friend.
Could you please have it
as near the gate as possible?
In about an hour.
He was like a madman.
He was a madman. He bit me.
- He urinated on my shoe.
- Urinated...
He told me he would kill her.
I didn' t believe him.
I blame myself.
If you' re gonna hang a first-degree
murder rap on Will, forget it.
This was true temporary insanity.
If Will is arrested.
I' ll testify to that in his defence.
I understand.
He' s staying at the Alden place
with Miss Alden, isn' t he?
- I really must find him.
- Ask her. She' s outside.
Laura Alden?
She' s gone. She left right after
Mr. Swinton went in.
We don' t need her.
Get a warrant for Randall.
Did he say
"on his shoe"  or "in his shoe" ?
No one gets through without a call!
No one!
The horses were restless tonight.
It' s all right.
Steer clear of the barn tonight.
- Will you tell the others?
- Yes, ma' am.
Can I help you?
- Mr. Swinton...
- I' m here to see Miss Alden.
I' m afraid I' ll have to call.
May I ask your business?
Pleasure.
She' d be the fuck of the decade.
- Back up.
- All right.
Excuse me!
- Can I help you?
- I' m here to see Miss Alden.
You' re not expected.
Really? I have a card...
... and an appointment. Here.
Hello. Miss Alden.
If you scream, I' ll kill you.
Il' ll just break your neck, okay?
This is a surprise.
- How did you get in?
- I smooth-talked the guard.
If anyone could do it...
Don' t play any more games.
You know, don' t you?
- What?
- What' s happening to me.
You' re playing games with me.
You pretended not to know Will.
You know what happened
to Charlotte.
All right, I do know Will and
I do know what' s happening to you.
Will told me, when I asked him
if there were any more like him.
- I' m not a fool. Laura.
- I know that.
If you find me so attractive,
how about me fucking you right now?
- How would that be?
- I' d have to try it first.
Hello. Will.
Locked you up, did she?
- Is my daughter all right?
- I thought she was with you.
Laura!
I heard gun shots.
I was afraid to come out.
- Are you with Randall?
- Where' s Randall?
As far as I know, he' s on his way
to Teterboro airport.
I told him I wasn' t going with him.
He hung up on me.
We' d like to check the cottage.
- What' s happening?
- They think Tom shot Swinton.
Laura. Tom is dead.
George, too, he was run down.
- With Stewart Swinton' s car.
- He was after Will.
At the police station,
he kept asking where Will was.
Laura Alden chartered a plane.
Swinton was looking for Randall.
He asked us if Randall was here.
When he found out that Laura Alden
was gone, he took off.
All this might not have happened, -
- but I was against Randall,
because he was after my daughter.
You were just trying to save me
from a disastrous relationship.
It would only have lasted a week.
He was too tame for me.
That' s what I thought when I saw
you together at the Mayflower.
I hope this time
you will give us a statement.
It would be my pleasure.
Could I get you
something to drink, detective?
- Another vodka-tonic?
- Another... no. thanks.
Let me know if you change your mind.
How did she know I' d been drinking?
I can smell it.
I can smell it a mile away.
