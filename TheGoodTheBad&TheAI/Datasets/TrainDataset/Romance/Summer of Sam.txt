Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.
My name is Jimmy Breslin.
I'm a writer.
I write about New York,
the city of my birth,
where I've lived
and worked all my life--
the city that I love
and hate both equally.
Today things
are much different.
Business is booming
up, up and up.
Crime is down, down, down.
Homicides are the lowest
it's been since 1 961 .
Well, it wasn't
always like this.
This film is about a different time,
a different place--
the good old days, the hot,
blistering summer of 1 97 7.
There are 8,000,000 stories
in the naked city,
and this was one of them.

Let's just go. Let's go.

- Let's go to the diner
and have some breakfast.
- Some eggs or something, you know?
And then we go home.
- All right.
- You don't wanna dance some more?
- I'll dance on the way out.
You follow me.
I want my breakfast.
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you, but I want my breakfast.
You danced so great
tonight, baby.
Ah, 'cause you're beautiful.
That's why.
Ah, don't stop.
It feels so good.
What--
What took you so long?
- I just stopped to take a leak.
-
I drank too much tonight,
you know?
Where?
At the house?
Come on! What, are you writin'
a book or somethin'?
No, I'm just asking.
Yeah. Yeah,
you're asking. Sure.
I just asked you
what took you so long.
- I didn't accuse you of anything.
- I know, sweetie pie.
You danced beautifully
tonight too, you know?
- It was a lot of fun.
-
Hey, officer, what the hell
happened over here? What's going on?
Come on.
To your right, now.
- Cruz, baby, que pasa?
- Double homicide.
- Yeah? .44-Caliber Killer?
- Looks like that.
I'm gonna see what's going on, okay?
You stay right here.
- Aw, geez, what a mess.
- Looks like somebody died
out here tonight.
- Hey, guy, what's up?
- I live over here, okay?
Oh.
These are victims six and seven.
The shit's gonna hit the fan.
Petrocelli, you're gonna like
this part. He left a note.
No shit?
He left a note?
Who is this guy?
Fuckin' William Shakespeare?
Yes, Lou,
this could be the break.
Somebody bag this.
Get one of our boys
to take it down to forensics.
Eddie, let's get a shot.
Hey! Hey, Vinny! You can't be there!
Come on, get outta there!
Get away from there!
Come on, get behind the line!
Come on!
- Come on, let's go.
- Get behind the yellow tape.
Come on, come on, come on.
-Let's go.
-Get him outta here. Get him outta here.
Come on.
Six and seven, Lou,
like you said.
There's nothing more to see here, folks.
- What time they find 'em?
- 1 0:20.
Who found 'em?
-
- Oh, my God!
Vincent, what's--
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
Baby, move over.
Move over.
I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to drive, okay?
All right. Wh-What happened?
What's wrong?
I just saw the bodies.
- The bodies?
-  He's back.
- Somebody got killed?
- The .44-Caliber Killer is back.
- Baby, please take me home.
Come on, I gotta get outta here.
-
Victims six...
seven.
All news, all the time.
You give us 22 minutes,:
we'll give you the world.
- WINS news time at the tone, 3:00.
-
It happened again last night.
More terror, more bloodshed.
The.44-Caliber Killer striking
again, leaving two more dead.
The police have recovered a note left
by the killer at the murder scene,
but have not released
its contents to the press.
And so parents continue their vigil,
warning their children not to go out,:
keeping their daughters home, afraid
to have them park in Lover's Lane...
-
- for fear they'll be another
victim of the mad killer.
It's hot and hazy and humid.
People trying to out at night,
but they're afraid to.
They're afraid
to walk the streets, afraid this
mad killer will strike again,
shooting them down
in cold blood.
-
- Good morning, Ma.
- Ritchie!
- Not a good morning for me. I'm losing.
Couldn't you put
some clothes on?
- Morning? It's 3:30 in the afternoon.
- Nice. Nice tux, Ed.
It's your mother's idea.
She got me a gig with a wedding band.
-That's what my career's boiled down to.
-Can I borrow 50 bucks, Ma?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- I gotta get my car fixed.
- Sure. Take it from the kitty.
- That kitty's for our food!
This is what I'm talking
about with this kid.
Hey, Ritchie, how about
working for a living?
- Only the colored and Spanish
live off of welfare.
- Mind your own business.
What, I gotta sing for $7 5 tonight, and
he get's 50? No, no, no, no, no, no.
Twenty dollars, and you should make him
work the game.
All right, but he's not gonna
work the game. Ritchie, take $20.
- I'm out.
-
Do you have anything cold to drink?
- Thanks, Ma.
- Shitty hand, as usual.
- Hey, Ritchie.
- What?
You hear about them kids
that got shot last night?
- What kids?
- Bad thing. Real bad thing.
Barracuda!
Get out of the water.
-Just a minute, Mommy.
- You've had enough.
Come on, come on!
What the hell?
Hey, guys, I've been buying
the Post and the Daily News all week.
It would be nice
to get some money back.
Boy, you got some set of balls.
You should be payin' us money
just to be standin' here.
- I been spendin'a lot of money.
- Oh, come on, will ya?
Shut the fuck up, all right?
Just listen to this.
''Although police officials declined
to discuss the contents of the note,
our unofficial source said
it was written by a homicidal maniac,
a real sicko who lives
in a nightmare world.''
-Joey, do I look pale to you?
- You look all right, Vin.
Hey, Anthony,
do I look pale to you?
Yeah, you look like
a piece of mozzarella.
- You guys are fuckin' funny.
- Holy shit! Look at this.
They got a map of all the killings.
This is our neighborhood.
- There's Layton Avenue.
-Joe, look. We're famous.
Let me see that.
You know, I'd lay five-to-one
the killer's from right here.
You think the killer's
from around here?
Don't you think we'd notice
a sicko like that? Come on,Joey.
What do you think makes them sickos,
you idiot? You don't notice 'em.
You think this was
some random killing?
You think he just
pulled off the highway?
You don't think he knew
where he was going?
-Joey, I need another 'lude.
- You just popped it.
- Give it a couple minutes.
- It's not working for me.
Give me another one. Come on.
- Don't be fuckin' cheap.
- Hey, Vinny, man, that was
some heavy shit you saw.
- I'd be freaking out if I was you.
- Yeah, I am.
Yo, Vinny, man, I'd be freaked out too,
since the killer knows you saw him.
- What do you mean the killer saw me?
- He might think you're a witness.
- You could be number eight.
- I'm serious, man.
I saw this on a news show.
- If he caught your license plate,
he knows where you live.
- They hang around.
- You think I'm number eight?
- I'm serious.
- Yeah, 'cause the guy--
they hang around.
- They stick around.
Oh, shut the fuck up!
I only saw victims.
- They look--
- Fuck you. I didn't see nobody.
Don't start spreadin'
that shit, fuckin' asshole!
Hey, what's the matter?
Will you leave him alone?
Oh, that's real funny,
right? Ha-ha!
- What's the matter?
You can't take a joke?
- No, I can't!
- Vinny, Vinny, relax.
- Come on. We're playin' with you.
Here, here, come on.
Take a half a 'lude.
- You fuckin'asshole.
- Go home and get some sleep, all right?
- Fuckin'guy can't take a joke.
- Leave him alone.
One fuckin' 'lude ain't gonna work
on this guy. Look at his face.
Why don't you guys go
fuckin'take a walk?
We were just jokin'. Holy shit!
Look at this fuckin'creature!
Hey, guys, I got lobsters.
Live lobsters.
- What do you got there,
Woodstock? Lobsters?
- Live lobsters, two dollars each.
What, are you stealing lobster traps
now? Those guys are gonna shoot you.
- If they catch me.
- Where were you last night?
You shoot two people?
- I only shoot heroin.
- These lobsters are broke.
- And they're half dead.
What is this shit?
- They're two dollars each.
Get the fuck outta here
with your broke, half-dead lobsters!
Joey, these are good.
You can make a brisque.
- Brisque this, you junkie!
-Joey, I'm gonna go cold turkey.
- Yeah, cold turkey that!
- Aw, come on!
What do you gotta do that for?
You ain't Bruce Lee.
Stop kicking Woodstock.
- Is that Ritchie?
- Yeah.
What the hell happened to you?
Look at this freak.
Nice outfit.
You get it off the dead?
I thought vampires
only came out at night.
Yeah, 'cept on leap year.
What's happening, guys?
Don't give us that
''What's happening'' bullshit.
You come back to the neighborhood
lookin' like a fuckin' freak,
soundin'like a British fag,
we're supposed to be okay with that?
You're fuckin' right.
How's your wife and kid,J.T.?
I got divorced.
Moved back in with my mother.
Look,Joey.
A dollar each.
- Go home and O.D. Go fuck yourself!.
- Shut up!
I'll take five dollars
for the whole fuckin' bag.
All right, all right,
all right. Here, here.
- Here's your five dollars.
Now get the fuck outta here.
- Get outta here.
- Woodstock, I need some smoke.
-  No, I'm handling that now.
What do you want?
I got nickels.
Yeah? All right.
I'll take two then.
Hey, Ritchie,
you heard about the killer?
Yeah, yeah, I heard. What's the matter,
Vin? Not gonna say hello?
Hello. And where the fuck
were you last night, huh?
You drove right past me
outside the club.
Will you do me a favor
and just drop this stupid accent
and talk to me for real, huh?
- Huh?
- All right.
So why didn't you come in?
We could've talked or something.
I wasn't really dressed
for disco dancing.
-  Look at this jerk-off.
- Come on!
- He was dressed for Halloween,
this fuckin'goblin.
- Leave him alone.
Hey, porcupine, Vinny saw
the dead bodies last night.
- You saw the bodies?
-  Yeah, I saw the bodies.
I was on my way home.
But I didn't see him, all right?
I didn't see no fuckin' killer,
you numbnuts, so don't fuckin'
spread that word around.
Hey, here comes Ruby the skank. Ruby!
Yeah, but I thought you said
your parents were in Hawaii.
First Europe,
then Hawaii.
You know, Ron, we've been dating
for three weeks now,
and all you ever do
is take me to motels.
'Kay? You wanna
see me again?
You introduce me
to your parents.
Must you continually
bring up my parents?
- What? Are you getting out of the car?
- Yeah, I gotta go.
What about our weekend
in the Catskills?
I've already
paid for the room.
Yeah? Well, then you can go there
and you can jerk off.
- 'Cause that's what you are,
a real fuckin'jerk-off.
- Fuck you, you dago wop skank!
- Whoa!
- Hey, what did you say?
- ''Dago wop skank''?
What are you? Fuckin'nuts?
- This doesn't concern you.
- Shut your fuckin' mouth!
That's my fuckin' sister!
- Stay away from the car.
- Get the fuck out of the car!
Get out of the car!
-
-
-
You fucker!
- Move your ass!
- Come on!
-
- Go back home, pretty boy!
He ain't showin' his face
around here again, baby.
Hey, Ruby, come over here.
I'm horny. I mean lonely.
- I need a hug.
- Then go home to your mother.
Twat you say?
I cunt hear.
I have an in-fuck-tion
in my ear.
Don't you assholes
ever grow up?
What the fuck
is your problem? I mean--
- Ruby!
- Hey, is that Ritchie?
- That freak don't want you.
- Get the fuck out of here. Ugh!
Ritchie, hey!
How are you?
- Hey, Ruby.
- How ya doin'? You look good.
- Aw, you look great.
- Good enough to eat?
Hey, I like the new look.
What, it's punk?
Yeah. You should come
to the city sometime.
- Maybe check out my band.
-  Yeah, they really suck.
- Yeah, they suck really good.
Just like you, Ruby.
- Come on. Relax.
Yeah, I learned
from your mother, dick.
- You gonna let your sister
talk that way to me?
-  She's my half-sister.
- Come on, get lost.
-  Leave me the fuck alone.
- You live in Manhattan now?
- I did as of last night. I got evicted.
- Oh.
- Will you stop talking like that?
Hey, you've been
in London too?
No, but it's-- it's all in the attitude.
It's all in the attitude.
''In the attitude.''
Well, I-I gotta go. My father's
gonna kill me. I'll see you.
- It was great seeing you.
- Yeah, you too. You look good.
-
- You take care of yourself, Ruby.
- Yeah.
- Be careful. Ritchie, come here.
I wanna talk to you.
- Yo, see you later.
- Take it easy on the rebound.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Oh. You tryin' to knock me down?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.
Relax. It's okay.
Don't tell nobody.
It's between you and me.
Now, it's bad enough
that I balled her, right?
But then some sick side of me had
to drive Dionna right past the spot...
where I was just sticking it
up her cousin's ass, you know?
Shit. And that's where I saw
the dead bodies, right there.
You know what? God spared me.
He spared me, man.
-
- 'Cause it's a fuckin' omen.
No, I'm serious.
He fuckin'-- He let me go.
What the fuck could this mean?
It means something.
What do you think it means?
I don't know.
What do you think it means?
I think God's tellin' me that I'm gonna
burn in hell if I don't stop cheatin'.
- Didn't I tell you
you weren't ready to get married?
- Yeah.
Didn't I?
You don't fuckin' listen.
'Cause I fuckin' thought
I was gonna stop cheatin'
when I got married, you know?
I thought so. And now I'm just fuckin'
cheatin' a lot more than I ever did.
But I thought--you know, I thought
the man up there understood.
I thought He under--
would fuckin'understand.
- God has got nothing
to do with this, Vin.
- Oh, come on, Ritchie.
Yes, He does.
Yes, He does.
God is tellin' me, ''You shouldn't
be doing these things with your wife.''
- That's what He's tellin' me.
- What things?
- Don't be stupid. You know.
- What?
You know, butt-fucking,
And that's the message. God is saying,
''You gotta cut that shit out.
- Aw, come on!
- Otherwise, I'm not gonna
spare you the next time.''
That's what God's
telling me.
Now, Ritchie, I'm telling you, I swear,
I think the guy saw my license plate.
I think he's after me.
I'm telling you, I'm gonna be
number eight. My life is over.
- I'm gonna die.
- You don't gotta worry...
about anybody comin' after you
or any omen.
What the fuck
am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
What if I can't stop?
- What if I got some sort
of hang-up, you know?
- You don't got any hang-ups.
You know, once you're deviated,
you can't go back. You know that.
Why don't you just tell Dionna
you like these things, and,
you know, maybe she'll do it.
- Come on. You don't do
that shit with your wife.
- Why not?
- Nah, it's a fuckin' sin.
- Oh, please.
''Please, can I put it up your ass,
please? Just one time. ''
- Don't fuckin' make fun of me, man.
- Ow! Stop.
- '' Let me put it up your ass.''
- Shut up.
''Oh, Dionna--''
All right. What do you want me to
tell you? Get a fuckin' divorce then.
Divorce is fuckin' evil, Ritchie.
You got some fuckin' really bad advice.
'' Evil'' spelled backwards
is ''live.''
You're a corny fuck,
you know that?
Dionna? Dionna,
I gotta talk to you.
What are you doing here?
Vinny, what are you doing here?
- I just gotta talk to you
for a minute, okay?
- Now?
Honey, we're in trouble.
We're in the weeds. We got
Luigi here, and we're not ready.
-Just sit down here by me. Shhh.
- Vinny.
- What's wrong with you?
- I just need to talk to you
for a minute, please.
And listen to me
for once, okay?
Could you?
Could you do that for me?
- All right.
- All right?
Now, what I saw last night made me
think about a lot of things, okay?
It opened up my eyes
really wide to everything.
And those murders
made me realize...
how much I love you.
I love you, Dionna.
And I swear to God--
I swear, I promise--
I promise you and I promise God
that I'm gonna be the best husband...
that you ever had
in your entire life.
If I had eight tongues, it wouldn't be
enough to tell you how much I love you.
- Okay. You swear to God?
- I swear to God, I love you.
Okay.
I'm so sorry about everything.
I love you so dearly.
Baby, um, I'm
in the middle of work.
I got-- Dad's in trouble,
and I gotta get stuff out.
Oh, make up some excuse, and then
come with me. Let's go somewhere.
- Oh, baby, I can't.
- I'll take you out to dinner.
I'll take you anywhere.
Why don't you stay here?
I'll make you something really nice.
I'll be done here in 20 minutes.
Sit down. I'll get you a glass of wine.
- I don't want to wait 20 minutes.
- A glass of wine.
Daddy, Luigi's veal.
He's waiting.
He'll wait.
He'll wait.
How's that husband Vinny of yours?
He's all right?
Well, he was all shook up, but
he's-- he's a lot better now.
- Thank God.
- How about you, Daddy?
You don't seem so good today?
How am I doing?
I'm concerned, okay?
I'm very worried
about your safety.
Did you see those parents
on television crying for their kids?
I don't want to be on the news talking
about the daughter I used to have.
When's the food coming? Tomorrow?
Get rid
of this thing too. It's disgusting.
- Hi. Here's your order.
- Ahh, nice. Thank you, honey.
- Beautiful, beautiful.
- Thank you for waiting.
- Tell your father he's a great man.
- That looks great. Thank you.
- Thank you, honeybunch.
- So long, sweetie.
- Give me a little pasta.
- You want some over here, Luigi?
- Yeah.
-  Okay, enough.
Luigi, look who's here.
Starsky and Hutch.
What, are we double-parked
outside or somethin'?
You gonna invite us
to sit or what?
You both got asses.
Feel free to use 'em.
Mario? Mario!
Si, Signor Luigi?
Two setups
for New York's finest.
You're gonna invite us to a meal?
You know that's against regulations.
You sit at my table,
you eat.
Nobody's counting, huh?
Sit down.
Detective, you ever have
veal Sorrentino?
- Uh, no, I haven't.
- Well, you're gonna have it now.
- Sounds delicious.
- That's Italian for veal delight.
- Yeah? What is it?
- It's Italian food.
- Veal what?
- Italian food. Veal Sorrentino.
- Grazie.
- You need your energy to catch
the criminals of the world.
Really?
I like that.
That's good.
Sorrentino, here you go.
- Try and catch this one.
-
Mm-hmm. Compliments
to the chef. Yeah.
Your partner ever tell you he ran
errands for me when he was a kid?
- No.
- Yeah.
When he was a pipsqueak,
too small even to piss straight.
- No, he never told me that.
-
Never told you other things.
Luigi, my partner knows
I'm from the neighborhood.
Can we get down to business?
What business?
We need your help.
What do you want me to do?
Arrest myself?
You know, I wish this was a joking
matter, but it's not. It's very serious.
I want to talk to you about this
crazy son of a bitch killer.
We need your help.
You got a hundred cops
on the task force.
You need my help?
I'm only a plumber.
Luigi,you know I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have to be.
I'm asking you: This guy, how many
people did he kill?
Three, four, five?
And with no disrespect,
Detective, in Harlem last night,
your people, the coloreds,
how many of each other did they kill?
- Seven, eight?
- Eight, nine, at least.
And on Saturday,
-
- Okay, I'm out. I'm out.
- Take it easy. Sit, sit, sit.
- So... so!
So... why didn't you
ask me who killed them ?
Huh? Not enough, uh,
press in it for ya?
Not enough Post
or Daily News headlines?
Look, there's a homicidal maniac
runnin' around the neighborhood.
- You don't wanna do anything about it?
- Hmm.
You have been busting my balls
ever since you got promoted.
Now, why is that? Wasn't I good to you
when you were a kid?
Didn't I take you
to Yankee Stadium?
Didn't you meet
Mickey Mantle?
He signed a baseball,
''To Louie, from Mickey Mantle. ''
Motherfuck the Mick.
Willie Mays was the man.
- Get outta here. Mick was the guy.
- Oh, fuck you.
- He was the guy. Come on.
-  All right, enough, enough.
And then the family--your family--
Didn't I take care of them?
I treated you like a son.
And now you have the balls to come
here and ask me to do you a favor?
Never!
When you wanted to become a cop,
did you come and ask me?
Did you ask
for my blessing? No.
And you could've been
a great plumber, as good as me.
I'm gonna read you something,
but it can't leave this table.
Not even the newspapers
know about this.
Read it.
'' Dear sir, I am deeply hurt by the
newspaper calling me a woman hater.
I'm not. But I am a monster.
I'm a little brat.
- I am the Son of Sam.
- I am the Son of Sam.
- Sam loves to drink blood.
-Sam loves to drink blood.
''Go out and kill,''
commands Father Sam.
Behind our house some rest.
Mostly young, raped and slaughtered,
their blood drained.
-
- Papa Sam keeps me locked
in the attic too.
- Shut that dog up!
- I can't get out.
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
When I look out the attic window
and watch the world go by,
-
- I feel like an outsider.
I am on a different wavelength
than everybody else.
Do you know where--
- No!
-
However, to stop me
you must kill me.
- Beelzebub. Beelzebub.
- Beelzebub. The chubby behemoth.
Prowling the streets,
looking for fair game.
It must be the water
they drink.
Help me.
I live for the hunt. My life.
Sir, I don't want
to kill anymore.
No!
-
- I want to make love to the world.
I love people.
I don't belong on Earth.
I want to wish you all
a happy Easter.
May God bless you
in this life and the next.
And for now,
I say good-bye and good night.
- Somebody help me!
- Police, let me haunt you
with these words.
- I'll be back.
- I'll be back.
To be interpreted as
bang-bang-bang, bang-bang-bang.
Yours in murder,
Mr. Monster.''
- HolyJesus Christ.
- Holy shit.
Will you excuse me
for a minute, Atwater?
Luigi...

Hey, pally, that catch

There's a long drive
way back to center field.

I fell in love with you.

Goddamn it, Ritchie!
We don't see you for a month!

- You come back again! You come, you go!
- I'm sorry.
Look, look, look. Thing is, your mother
and I have been talking.
She packed your shit up.
We want you to stay in the garage now.
I'm not stayin'
in the fuckin' garage.
- This is not the fuckin'
Sherry-Netherland.
- Use the fuckin' bedroom!
- What are you doing here?
- It's your mother and I's house.
We can do whatever the fuck
we want! You're too old
to be staying here anyway.
You should be happy that we're
lettin' you stay in a fuckin' garage.
- Ma, this guy's kickin' me out!
- Helen!
- He's makin' me live in the garage!
- Talk to this fuckin' kid.
- Ma, I can't believe this.
- Helen, talk to him!
- He's kicking me
out of my own house, Ma!
- It won't be bad in the garage.
I'll give you money
to fix it up.
You can play your guitar
loud, whatever you want!
- I want to d--
- Your mother and I,
we need our fuckin'
privacy, okay?
Now, from now on, I want you to ring
the fuckin' front doorbell.
You got that? Ring the front doorbell.
Give me your keys.
- Give me the keys right now.
Come on, give me the keys.
- I ain't givin' you--
- What are you, fuckin' 1 2?
Helen, talk to this fuckin'--
- Ma! Ma!
- Helen!
- Ma? What are you doin', Ma?
- Please don't fuckin' do this to me.
- Oh, Ritchie, stop it.
- I fuckin' hate you,
you fuckin' fat piece of shit!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- Helen, it's him or me!
- Eddie, he is my son, goddamn it!
- Now I got a case of blue balls!
- You happy? Huh?
- Eddie!
The Son of Sam killer
who has been targeting...
young women
with shoulder-length hair...
has caused panic-stricken brunettes
to run to their hairdressers...
to dye their hair blonde as
protection against this madman.
But if you come in earlier,
I can't do your color.
Ruby, how come
you don't come around no more?
So you'll come in at 4:00
and we'll take care of you.
Be careful the way
your life's going, huh?
By the time you get to the altar you
might say ''I did''instead of''I do. ''
Shut up. You sound like my
fuckin' father. All right, Vinny?
- Yeah, but I'm not your
father, am I? Huh?
- No.
Hey, Vinny,
I heard you saw the killer.
- Who told you that shit?
-Just heard it around the neighborhood.
Well, I didn't see anybody,
okay? Just remember that.
Okay. Look,

-  Use it.
- * Come on a dance with me *
- See ya, Ruby.

- Yeah.
Fuckin', those guys are like
the godfathers of punk. You know that?
- You know that song ''Baba O'Riley''?
- Uh-huh.
That's my favorite song.
You know who wrote that?
- Englebert Humperdinck?
- Mm-mm.
What,you don't think I know?
Come on, I know. Pete Townsend.
- How'd you know that?
- I read the album credits.
I mean, the only thing
I don't get is...
why are those four guys
pissing on a big rock?
- Like in a photo shoot,
they were all drinking.
- Are you two getting married?
- Can I get to work?
- Are you jealous?
-  Please.
- I need a favor.
- What's goin' on?
- Fuckin' Eddie's got me

-And use it well, all right?
- Thank you.
Fifty bucks?
Fifty fuckin'bucks?
I can turn that place
into a palace with 50 bucks.
Hey, I'm not doin'
anything later.
You know, I'll come by,
and I'll help you decorate.
- You know what that means.
- Shut up!
Might as well use this
psycho killer as an excuse.
Go ahead... blonde me.
-
- You did a good job.
I could dig it, you know?
Maybe I can be
an interior decorator.
- Huh?
- You could be
whatever you want, I think.
Sure.
- Yeah.
- Well, you really mean that?
Of course I mean that.
Mmm. I don't know.
I figure, you're born into a slot,
you know, and that's life.
Ruby, come on. You gotta stop
with those negative vibes,you know?
You hang around with those spirit
snipers, they're gonna steal your light.
- You're too young for that.
- Uh-huh.
What are you doing?
Hey, come on. Come on, come on,
come on. You don't gotta do that.
- Hmm-hmm.
- Ruby, Ruby, stop, please.
You don't gotta do that.
Don't do it.
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm gonna go.
- I didn't say to go.
- Well, you didn't exactly say
you wanted me to stay.
Stay.
It's good.
Hi, baby. How ya doin'? I'm sorry. I-I--
Yeah, I'll be home.

Not now, all right? Okay.
Toni-- Bye.

Just--
I'm telling you, Vinny, she
can't give you what you want.
Yeah, let's not talk
about her, okay?
*Feel a strange
love and affection *
-
- Oh, my God.
*I like the way you make me
feel about you, baby *
*I want the whole
wide world to see *

- Now?
- Yeah, and I'm-- I'm thinking I--
- I'm just trying to be
a good husband right now.
- Aw, Geez.
- I just don't feel like we can do it.
- You know, Vinny,

back and forth, forth and back.
Let's do it, let's not do it. You know
what, Vinny? Let's just not do it.
- Okay? That's it.

You think you're the only one who's got

You're a selfish bastard.

Put your fuckin' clothes on.
Clothes I put on your back.

-
You know, with that
reward money, I'm gonna start
a college fund for my daughter.
Yeah? I'd by a yacht. Like Hugh Hefner,
I'd get Playboy bunnies walking around.
-
- You can't get a yacht with ten grand.
You're gonna wind up with a row boat
with two Puerto Rican skanks.
- What are you talkin' about?
- When I get that money,
I'm gonna take my parents home to
Sicily for a whole fuckin' month.
Hey, what did I tell you about your
filthy mouth in front of my daughter?
- I apologize.
- That's your daughter?
- Yeah, she's Daddy's little sweetheart.
- Hey, there.
- Daddy!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't touch her!
- What's the matter with you?
Come here, sweetheart.
- I didn't do nothin'.
What'd you do, man?
It's all right. Daddy's here.
What, you dress like that,
you don't think it's gonna
have an effect on a baby?
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, sweetheart.
It's okay. You okay?
Ooh, don't look
at that scary guy. Come here.
Go over-- Go play with your friends,
okay? Get away from him.
Give me more reasons
to hate your ass.
I'm back!
Give me back the 1 5
I lent you last week.
What are you talk-- I gave you the $ 1 5.
- What do you want?
- Two nicks.
- Hello, Brian.
- He-Hey! Bobby the fairy!
How's it hangin', huh?
That's Mrs. Del Fiore to you,
sweetheart. And don't wear it out.
Is that Ritchie?
Well, hello, stranger.
Long time no see.
Very Lower East Side.
I like it.
- I'll take two,Joey.
- Two what? Two dicks?
I'll take yours and Ritchie's.
Double the pleasure, double the fun.
Here, suck on these two nickels.
Just give me the money.
Let's go. Come on,
come on, come on. Come on.
- This money better not
be sticky, either.
- There-There you go.
Thank you.
It said in the Post
the killer's a woman hater.
That's you, Bobby.
You could be the killer.
- .44-Caliber Queer.
- Pow! Pow! Pow!
- A real ''homo-cidal'' maniac.
- He's guilty. Put him through
the penal system.
Well, only if I can have you
as my cell mate.
- How 'bout that, you motherfucker?
- Ah, shit!
You asshole!
You fucking asshole! I hate you!
Come on, don't burn him!
He's a paying customer!
- He's a fuckin' homo!
- Ridiculous, man.
Look, I gotta go drop the kid off
with her mother. I'll see you later.
- See you later at the club?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Joey, can you give me and Ruby
a lift to the subway?
Fuck no. You made her cry once already.
Come on. Sweetheart.
- Come on, princess. Princess, come on.
- Daddy!
- Hey, Ruby!
- Come on, let's go.
Daddy, Daddy,
let's go home!
- So what's goin' on with you and Ruby?
- What? She's my date.
- Your date?
She's goin' on a date with you?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, Ritch, why buy the cow
when everybody else is gettin'
the milk and steaks for free?
I like the cow.
Brian, do me a favor.
Give me and Ruby a lift.
Come on, man. I'm fuckin' busy.
You can ride your cow to the subway.
Hey, cows don't fit in Corvettes.
I'm sorry, Ritch.
You're serious?
You're not gonna give me a lift?
You know, Ritch.
Nothin'for nothin',
but are you startin' to get
the feelin' that maybe you're
not that welcome around here?
I mean, do I got to
spell it out for you?
Nah, it's clear.
What you got this time?
'Cause I heard it before from you.
You know, and I got in trouble from you.
That's 'cause you sent me chicken.
I don't need no chicken.
I don't need no trouble from the law.
- Thank you very much. Hold on a sec.
- Hey.
Let me get back to you, okay?
I'm working.
Somebody's gotta make some money here.
- Hey, man.
- Ritchie.
- This is Ruby.
- Ruby.
- This is Midnite.
- Hello.
- Let me do a show tonight.
- Got enough performers today.
- One show.
- One show?
I got rules, Ritchie,
and you know the rules.
Five shows a day,
seven days a week.
- I know.
- You know, but if I break
the rules for you,
- I'm gonna have every little
punk comin' up here...
- I just need some moolah.
every time
they need a dime bag.
- Relax. One show.
- ''Just one show. Relax.''
- This girl's special to me.
- Oh, well, then you appeal
to my sense of romantic.
Uh-huh. Let me see
how special she is.
- What color panties you have on, honey?
- Hey.
- Let me see. What color?
I just want to see color.
- Cut it out.
- You tell me she's special.
Blue. Okay, blue.
- Stop. You're bein' rude.
- What are you doin'?
- Go ahead.
He's got a pretty cock.
Nice size. You're a lucky girl.
Yeah, thanks.
- You in the business, baby?
- Business?
Yeah. You strip? You do fuck flicks?
What's your shtick, baby?
No, I'm-I'm not
in the business.
Girl, you're way too hot
to be giving it away.
You're so hot, you make me wish
I was a lesbian.
-  How are you doing, guys?
- Hey.
- Go right on up.
- You wanna get this hotel room?
No. Ritchie,
wait a minute.
Look, if you're gettin'
second thoughts, I mean--
No, I'm not getting
second thoughts.
I just wanna know
if I can borrow some money...
because I wanna ditch
this whole disco look.
**
Let me get your door, okay?
I wanna do this right.
- Come on, baby.
- Thank you, baby.

- Tonight's your night. And my night.
- It's our night.

like cowards for two weeks.
Fuck the .44-Caliber Killer. We're
gonna have fun tonight. It's Saturday.
- Whoo!
- Saturday. Ulysses!
- Hey!
- How ya doing, stronzo?
- Great. Have a good time.
-
-  What an idiot.
- Ah, he doesn't have a clue.
- Oh, my God, honey. Nobody's here.
- What the fuck is going on?
- Did they all go somewhere else?
-  So I got to make an excuse.
I say, ''Oh, uh, I got to take care
of my grandmother, ''I say.
- Holy shit!
- Whoa.
-  Dionna, what a dress!
- Easy, now.
- Look at those legs.
- They're longer than Vinny's.
-
- A lot longer.
- That's all right, though.
I can handle it.
- Oh, man.
Hey, what's the matter here? We got
like a morgue going on. What's going on?
Everybody's afraid of this
killer,just like you, Vin.
- Ah, man.
- Not as scared as I was.
Dionna, you look very beautiful
tonight. May I have this dance?
Yeah, can I dance
with you too?
- Wishful thinking.
- Maybe youse better dance
with each other.
- Yeah, dance together.
-  Now I know
why you never come out with us.
That's right. Why would I go out
with you with those Pink Panther pants?
*If you think
you're groovy, mama *

of N. Y.C.,
which are filled
with dog manure, vomit,

which swallow up
these delicacies...
when they are washed away
by the sweeper trucks.
Screw Son of Sam.

-
- Hello from the cracks in
the sidewalks of New York City,
and from the ants
that dwell in these cracks...
and feed on the dried blood that
has settled into these cracks.
- Mr. Breslin, sir,
-
don't think that because you
haven't heard from me for a while...
No. Rather, I am still here,
like a spirit roaming the night.
- ''Thirsty, hungry,
seldom stopping to rest,
- Thirsty, hungry,
- anxious to please Sam.''
- anxious to please Sam.
-
- I love my work.
Now the void has been filled.
He won't let me stop killing
until he gets his fill of blood.
what will you have for me
July 29th?
Not knowing what the future
holds, I shall say farewell.
And I will see you
at my next job.
- Or, shall I say,you will see
my handiwork at the next job.
- In the name of the Father--
P.S. Please inform
all the detectives...

What are you doing here? Don't you know

Well, why would he think
you saw him?
Did you see him?
Honey, you're scaring me.
Did you see him?
Baby, I gotta get outta here.
I gotta get outta here.
I can't take this anymore. I'm fuckin'
gonna have a nervous breakdown.
I gotta get outta here.
Let's go away for a whole fuckin' week.
Let's just get out of here.

- Let's go right now.
Let's pack up our shit and get

We'll get dirty movies.
We'll fuckin' get massages,

You'll see.
We can have our own fun.
Come on. Let's--
Come on.
Let's make love.
Baby. Baby?
Hey, baby.
Co-Could we make love
with the light on?
What?
- I wanna see us.
- You wanna make love with the light on?
Yeah, I wanna see us.
Can we try it?
Please?
All right. How 'bout instead
of making love, we fuck this time, huh?
- Yeah?
- Okay.
-
-  Ow.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
Oh! Oh!
Yeah. Oh!
Oh, shit.
Good night.
Let's go to sleep.
Good night, baby.
Good evening. This is John Jeffries,
Eyewitness News.
I'm here
with Detective Timothy Dowd,
head of the .44-Caliber Killer
Task Force.
Detective Dowd, what can you tell
our viewers about Son of Sam?
Well,John, we are putting together
a picture of the suspect,
uh, slowly, I must say.
Too slowly for our tastes,
but we have no choice.
This is a very elusive suspect.
Whenever we get there, he's gone.
We never know where
he's going to strike next.
- But I will tell you this:
- What are they talking about anyway?
The man must live somewhere, so
we have a man who we suspect--
Maybe you notice that he comes home
late, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning.
- This is all fuckin' smoke.
- It's a farce. A farce.
Smoke.
They don't know what they're doing.
Do you have a long list of suspects?
We have a list.
We've always had a list. We have a list
now, and we have always had a list.
-I know what we gotta do.
-John Jeffries, task force headquarters.
We gotta get this rat bastard.
We gotta do it.
'Cause they can't do it.
And maybe we offer another
$5,000 in the reward, huh?
- At least we'll get
a few more names on our list.
- Right, boss.
It's bad.
Yeah. They're gonna catch
this bastard soon, ah?
Okay, do me a favor.
Buy me a little time.
Do the books one more time.
See if you find something.
Dad, it's math.
It's not magic.
I've been through them
four times already.
If something doesn't change soon,
I don't know what's gonna happen.
I gotta tell Connie
I gotta let her go.
Connie? Dad, she's our strongest
waitress. You can't do that.
Connie's got no children. That's only
one mouth that's got to stay empty.
- Hey, what's up.
-
- Hey, paisan.
- How ya doing?
How are you? All right?
Where were you?
Stadium. Yankees lost.
-Come on. Let's go. I'm tired.
-All right, Dad. I guess we're gonna go.
Aspett' one minute, okay?
I got something for the both of youse.
-  We gotta go.
- I got something for both of youse.
Wait a minute.
- Oh,you do?
- Yeah. You like presents.
- Come here.
- What is this, Dad?
- Look at that.
- What the hell is that?
If you go out tonight, Vinny,
make her wear it for me?
Dad, I'm not gonna wear this. Come on.
We're just gonna drive straight home.
Do me a favor. For your father.
Please respect me.
This animal is killing only
young girls with long, brown
hair. Please, do it for me.
- Come on. Listen to your father.
Come on.
- Are you gonna gang up on me?
- Yeah.
- All right. I'll wear
the Barbie doll... thing.
That's right. You make me
sleep in peace, huh? Please?
- Please? Thank you.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Are they closed?
- Yeah.
- Promise?
- I swear to God.
- I hear you coming.
- * When we met *
- *It wasn't quite clear to me *
- I know you're standin' there.
- I'm here. Okay.
- * What you had in store
was there for only me *
- Wow.
*Silly,you know you took me
by surprise *
- Wow, baby.
- * Then I turned and looked *
-Jesus Christ.
- *And I saw that message in your eye *
- You like?
- You look so different.
-Jesus, I feel like
I'm cheating on you with you.
- *I fell on the floor *
- Oh. Wow. Oh, baby.
- * The way you move, girl
only made me want you more *
I wanna call you by another name.
You know what I'm gonna call you?
- I'm gonna call you Sheri.
- I like that name.
- Is it French?
- Oh, yeah.
Sheri, do you want to fuck?
Want to fuck me, Sheri?
- Do you want to fuck me?
- Yeah, I want to fuck you.
Can I call you Vincente?
Yeah,
but first you have to suck my huge cock.
- You sure you want me
to do that, Vincente?
-
I know Sheri loves it.
Whoa, baby.
-* When you lay down next to me *
-
Wow.
*I find it hard for me
to concentrate *
*If I don't make my move
then it might be too late *
- *I've got to make sure
you don't get away *
- Oh.
- Oh, shit.
- *After all you've done, girl
to make me want to stay *
- *All my life I've been
searching for a star *
-
-
- *Now my search is over
and here we are *
- *Livin'in ecstasy *
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh!
- * Yeah *
-* When you lay down next to me *
- Oh, shit.
-
- * Yeah, we're in ecstasy *
- Oh, shit.
-* When you lay down next to me *
- Oh, shit. Oh, no, no, no.
Don't do that.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Did I hurt you?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I should have never made you do this.
I'm so-- I should've never done this.
- I'm sorry, baby.
I'm really fucking sorry.
- What?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Baby, what-what happened?
- What happened?
- No, no, no.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Tell me how
you like it. I'll do it different.
- It's not that.
Baby, baby, it's not that.
- I'll do it different.
Please. It's just--
You're my wife, okay? And
I love you just the way you are.
Let's do it just like normal people,
the way we always fucking do it.
Let's just do it regular.
Come on.
But, baby, I-I-I wanna
make you happy.
- I'm gonna turn off the light, okay?

All right. You see that guy
over there making pies?

It's all right.
Everything's fine.

Samuel Carr,
I have asked you kindly...
to stop that dog from howling
all day, all night long.
- Yet he continues to do so.
- Now, Berkowitz, you listen to me!
- I have no peace, no rest.
- Harvey's a good dog.
-He usually leaves people alone.
-Now I know what kind of person you are.
- You're cruel and inconsiderate.
- The reason that this dog is
barking at you all the time...
is you tease him, you antagonize him,
you never stop fooling around with him.
- You wicked, evil man!
Child of the Devil!
- I'm gonna call the cops!
Shut that dog up!
Now you keep it up, fella, and I'm
calling the cops! I'm sick of this!
-
- Kill...
You won't
be barking anymore.
Help me!
