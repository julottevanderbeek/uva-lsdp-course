- Evening, Mr. Godby.
-
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Quite the stranger, aren't you?
- I couldn't get in yesterday.
- I wondered what had happened to you.
- I had a bit of a dustup.
- What about?
Saw a chap getting out
of a first-class compartment.
When he came to give up his ticket,
it was only third class.
I told him to pay the excess,
and he turned nasty.
- I had to send for Mr. Saunders.
- Fat lot of good he'd be.
- He ticked him off.
- Seeing's believing.
I tell you,
he ticked him off proper.
That's what I mean. He didn't have
the courage to handle it himself.
- He had to call in the police.
- Aw, he's not a bad lot, Mr. Saunders.
You can't expect much spirit from a man
with one lung and a wife with diabetes.
I thought something must be wrong
when you didn't come.
- I would've popped in to explain,
but I had a date and had to run.
- Indeed.
- Chap I know is getting married.
- Very interesting, I'm sure.
- What's up with you, anyway?
- I'm sure I don't know
to what you're referring.
- You're a bit unfriendly
all of a sudden.
- Beryl, hurry up.
Put some more coal in the stove
while you're at it.
I'm afraid I can't really
stand here wasting my time
in idle gossip, Mr. Godby.
- Aren't you going
to offer me another cup?
- When you've finished that one.
Beryl'll give it to you.
I've got my accounts to do.
I see.
I'd rather you gave it to me.
Time and tide wait for no man,
Mr. Godby.
- Laura, what a lovely surprise!
- Oh, Dolly.
My dear, I've been shopping
till I'm dropping.
My feet are nearly off,
my throat's parched.
I thought of having tea in Spindle's,
but I was terrified of losing the train.
- Oh, dear.
- This is Dr. Harvey.
- How do you do?
- Would you be a perfect dear
and get me my cup of tea?
I really don't think I could drag
my poor old bones over to the counter.
No, please.
Dear, what a nice-looking man.
Who on earth is he?
You're quite a dark horse.
I shall telephone Fred in
the morning and make mischief.
This is a bit of luck.
I haven't seen you for ages.
I've been meaning to pop in,
but Tony's had measles and I had
all that fuss over Phyllis.
- But, of course, you don't know.
My dear, she left me.
- Oh, how dreadful.
Mind you, I never cared for her much,
but Tony adored her.
I'll tell you all about that later
in the train. Thank you so very much.
There's certainly enough milk in it,
but still, it'll be refreshing.
- Oh, dear, no sugar.
- It's in the spoon.
Oh, of course.
What a fool I am.
Laura, you're looking
frightfully well. I wish I'd
known you were coming in today.
We could've come together
and lunched and had a good gossip.
I loathe shopping
by myself anyway.
- There's your train.
- Yes, I know.
- Aren't you coming with us?
- I go in the opposite direction.
My practice is in Churley.
- Oh, I see.
- I'm a general practitioner.
- Dr. Harvey's going out
to Africa next week.
- Oh, how thrilling.
- I must go.
- Yes, you must.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Talking of missing trains reminds me of
that awful bridge at Broadham Junction.
You've got to go traipsing all up one
side along the top and down the other.
- Well, the other day, I'd been
over about renewing the lease.
I arrived at the station at
exactly half a minute to spare.
My dear, I flew.
I'd got Tony with me,
and like a fool, I just bought a new
shade for the lamp in the drawing room.
I could've gotten it
just as easily here in Milford.
Well, it was the most enormous thing.
I could hardly see over it.
I've never been in such a hurry in
my life. I nearly knocked a woman down.
-
- Oh, is that our train?
Is that the Ketchworth train?
-
- The boat train.
Oh, of course. That doesn't stop,
does it? I want some chocolate, please.
- Milk or plain?
- Plain, I think.
Or, no, perhaps milk would be nicer.
Have you any with nuts?
Nestle's Nut Milk.
Shilling or sixpence?
I'll take one plain
and one nut milk.
- Large or small?
- Large, please.
Oh.
Where is she?
I never noticed her go.
I just wanted to see
the express go through.
- I feel a little sick.
- My dear, come and sit down.
- There's our train.
- It's all right.
Have you any brandy?
-
-
- I'm all right, really.
- Just a sip of brandy
will buck you up. Please.
- Very well.
- Thank you. How much?
- Tenpence, please.
We shall have to hurry.
Oh, well, this is a bit of luck.
This train's generally packed.
I really am very worried about you,
dear. You look terribly peaky.
I'm all right. Really, I am. I just
felt faint for a minute, that's all.
It often happens to me. I did it once
in the middle of Bobby's school concert.
- I don't think he's ever forgiven me.
-
- Well, he certainly was
very good-looking.
- Who?
Your friend, Doctor...
whatever his name was.
- Yes, he's a nice creature.
-
No, not very long.
I hardly know him at all, really.
- Fancy him going all the way
to Africa. Is he married?
- Yes.
-
- Yes, two boys.
He's very proud of them.
- Is he taking them with him,
his wife and children, I mean?
- Yes, he is.
I suppose it's sensible in a way
rushing off to start life anew
in the wide open spaces,
but wild horses wouldn't
drag me away from England...
and home and all the things
I'm used to.
-
- Oh, yes, one has one's roots.
I knew a girl once years ago
who went to Africa.
Her husband was something
to do with engineering.
She had the most dreadful time.
-
- Oh, Dolly.
- What's the matter,
are you feeling ill again?
- No, I feel a bit dizzy.
- I think I'll close my eyes
for a little.
- Oh, you poor darling.
And here am I chattering away 19
to the dozen. I won't say another word.
If you drop off, I'll wake you
when we get to the level crossing.
That'll give you a chance to pull
yourself together and powder your nose.
Thanks, Dolly.
-
-
-
-
I could easily come
to the house with you, dear.
It isn't very much out of my way.
Thank you. All I have to do is walk down
Elmore Lane, past the grammar school.
It's sweet of you, Dolly, but I'm
perfectly all right now, really I am.
- You're quite sure?
- Absolutely positive.
Thank you for being so kind.
Oh, nonsense, dear.
I shall telephone in the morning
and see if you've had a relapse.
I shall disappoint you.
Good night.
Good night. Oh, give my love
to Fred and the children.
-
- Yes, dear.
- Why? What's the matter?
-
-
- Yes, Margaret.
Come upstairs at once, Mummy!
I want to talk to you.
You're both very naughty. You should
have been asleep hours ago. What is it?
Well, Mummy, tomorrow's  birthday,
and I want to go to the circus.
And tomorrow's not Margaret's birthday,
and she wants to go to the pantomime.
My birthday's in June.
There aren't any pantomimes in June.
It's far too late
to discuss it tonight,
and if you don't go to sleep, I shall
tell Daddy not to let you go to either.
Oh, Mummy!
Why not take them to both? One
in the afternoon, one in the evening?
You know that's impossible. We shouldn't
get them to bed till all hours,
and they'd be tired
and fractious.
Well, then, one on one day
and the other on the other.
You're always accusing
of spoiling the children.
Their characters would be ruined
in a fortnight if I left them
to your over-tender mercies.
All right, have it
your own way.
- Circus or pantomime?
- Neither.
We'll thrash them both soundly,
lock them up in the attic...
Oh, Fred.
- What on earth's the matter?
- Nothing. It's nothing.
Darling, what's wrong?
- Tell me, please.
- Really and truly, it's nothing.
I'm just a little rundown,
that's all.
I had a sort of fainting spell
at the refreshment room at Milford.
Isn't it idiotic?
Dolly Messiter was with me,
and she talked and talked and talked
until I wanted to strangle her.
Still, she meant to be kind.
Isn't it awful about people
meaning to be kind?
- Would you like to go to bed?
- No, Fred, really.
Come and sit by the fire
in the library and relax.
You can help me
with the  crossword.
- You have the most
peculiar ideas of relaxation.
- That's better.
- There you are, darling.
- Thank you.
But why a fainting spell?
I can't understand it.
Don't be silly, darling. I've often
had fainting spells, and you know it.
Don't you remember Bobby's
school concert and Eileen's wedding...
and that time you insisted
on taking me to that symphony
concert at the town hall?
Go on, that was a nosebleed.
I suppose I must be that type of woman.
It's very humiliating.
I still maintain there'd be no harm
in you seeing Dr. Graves.
- It would be a waste of time.
-
Do shut up about it, darling.
You're making a fuss about nothing.
I'd been shopping and was tired.
The refreshment room was hot,
and I suddenly felt sick.
- Nothing more than that.
- All right.
Really nothing more than that.
Now you get on with your puzzle
and leave me in peace.
Have it your own way.
You're a poetry addict. See if you can
help me over this. It's Keats.
"When I behold
upon the night starred face...
huge cloudy symbols of a high"...
something in seven letters.
Romance, I think.
I'm almost sure it is.
"Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance."
It'll be in the
No, that's right, I'm sure,
because it fits in with
"delirium" and "Baluchistan."
- Would some music
throw you off your stride?
-
##

- Any sugar? Thank you.
- In the spoon.
-
-
- Minnie hasn't touched her milk.
- Did you put it down for her?
Yes, but she never came for it.
- Fond of animals?
- In their place.
My landlady's got
a positive mania for animals.
She's got two cats...
one Manx, one ordinary...
three rabbits in a hutch
in the kitchen... they belong
to her little boy by rights...
and one of those dark-looking dogs
with hair over its eyes.
I don't know
to what breed you refer.
I don't think it knows itself.
-
-
-
-
Please, a glass of water.
I've got something in my eye,
and I want to bathe it.
- Would you like me to look?
- Oh, no, don't trouble.
I expect the water will do.
- Thank you.
- Bit of coal dust, I expect.
A man I knew lost the sight in one eye
through getting a bit of grit in it.
- Nasty, very nasty.
- Better?
- I'm afraid not. Ooh.
- Can I help you?
Oh, no, please,
it's only something in my eye.
- Try pulling your eyelid down
as far as it'll go.
- And then blowing your nose.
- Please let me look.
I happen to be a doctor.
- It's very kind of you.
Turn around
to the light, please.
Now look up.
Now look down.
Keep still. I see it.
- There.
- Oh, what a relief. It was agonizing.
- It looks like a bit of grit.
- The express went through.
Thank you very much, indeed.
-
- How lucky for me
you happened to be here.
- Anybody could've done it.
- Never mind, you did,
and I'm most grateful.
- There's my train. I must go. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Good morning. How's the eye?
- Oh, Good morning.
Perfectly all right. How kind it was
of you to take so much trouble.
- It was nothing at all.
It's clearing up I think.
- Yes, it's going to be nice.
- Well, I must be getting along
to the hospital.
- And I to the grocers.
- What exciting lives we lead,
don't we? Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Yes, I'll have it.
- Thank you, madam.
-
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning. Are you all alone?
- Yes, I am.
- Would you mind if I shared your table?
It's very full.
- No, of course not.
I'm afraid we haven't been introduced
properly. My name's Alec Harvey.
How do you do?
Mine's Laura Jesson.
- Mrs. Or Miss?
- Mrs.
- You're a doctor, aren't you?
I remember you said so that day
in the refreshment room.
- Yes.
Not a very interesting one. Just an
ordinary G.P. My practice is in Churley.
- Yes, sir? Excuse me, sir?
- What did you plump for?
Um, the soup and fried sole.
- Yes, I'll have the same.
- Anything to drink?
No, thank you. That is,
would you like anything to drink?
- No, thank you. Just plain water.
- Plain water, please.
Will you just look
at the cellist?
It really is dreadful, isn't it?
But we oughtn't laugh.
They might see.
There should be a society
for the prevention of cruelty
to musical instruments.
- You don't play the piano, I hope?
- I was forced to as a child.
- You haven't kept it up?
- No, my husband isn't musical at all.
- Good for him.
- For all you know, I might have
a tremendous burning talent.
- Oh, dear, no.
- Why are you so sure?
You're too sane
and uncomplicated.
I suppose it's a good thing
to be uncomplicated
but it does sound a little dull.
You could never be dull.
- Do you come here every Thursday?
- Yes, to spend a day at hospital.
Stephen Lynn, the chief physician here
graduated with me.
I take over from him once a week.
Gives him a chance to go to London.
- Gives me a chance
to study the hospital patients.
- I see.
- Do you?
- Do I what?
- Come here every Thursday?
- Yes, I do the week's shopping.
Thank you.
Change my library book, have lunch
and generally go to the pictures.
Not a very exciting routine,
but it makes a change.
- Are you going to the pictures
this afternoon?
- Yes.
How extraordinary.
So am I.
I thought you had to spend
all day at the hospital.
Well, between ourselves, I killed
two patients by accident this morning.
The matron's very displeased with me.
I simply daren't go back.
- How can you be so silly?
- Seriously, I did get through
most of my work this morning.
It won't matter at all if I play truant.
Would you mind if I came with you?
- Well, l...
- I could sit downstairs,
and you could sit upstairs.
- Upstairs is too expensive.
-
- I really must insist.
- I couldn't possibly.
Having forced my company on you,
it's only fair I pay.
Please, don't insist.
I should so much rather we halved it.
- I would really, please.
- I shall give in gracefully.
Thank you.
We have two choices:
at the Palace...
- or  at the Palladium.
- You're very knowledgeable.
There must be no argument about buying
the tickets. We each pay for ourselves.
You must think me a poor doctor
if I can't afford a couple
of one-and-ninepennies.
- I insist.
- I hoped you were going to treat me.
- Which is it: Palace or Palladium?
- Palladium.
I was once very sick on a channel
steamer called
-
-
Excuse me.
I feel awfully grand perched up here.
It was very extravagant of you.
- It was a famous victory.
- Do you feel guilty as all? I do.
- Guilty?
- You ought to more than me.
You neglected your work.
I worked this morning. A little
relaxation never did harm to anyone.
Why should either of us
feel guilty?
- I don't know.
- How awfully nice you are.
It can't be.
It is.
- What's she like... your wife?
- Madeleine?
Small, dark,
rather delicate.
How funny. I should have thought
she would've been fair.
And your husband?
What's he like?
Medium height, brown hair, kindly,
unemotional and not delicate at all.
- You said that proudly.
- Did I?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
We've just got time for a cup of tea
before our trains go.
And for the third time in one week, he
brought that common man and his wife...
to the house without so much as
a "by your leave."
- Two teas, please.
- Cake or pastry?
- Cake or pastry?
-
- Are those Bath buns fresh?
- Certainly they are. Made this morning.
Two, please.
That'll be sevenpence.
- Take the tea to the table, Beryl.
- I'll carry the buns.
You must eat one of these.
Fresh this morning.
- Very fattening.
- I don't hold to such foolishness.
- They do look good, I must say.
- One of my earliest passions in life...
never outgrown it.
-
-
-
-
Well, it's all very fine, I said,
expecting me to do this,
that and that other,
but what do I get out of it?
You can't expect me to be a cook,
housekeeper and char during the day...
and a loving wife in the evening,
just because you feel like it.
Oh, dear me, no. There are just as good
fish in the sea as ever came out of it.
And I packed me boxes
then and there and left him.
- Didn't you never go back?
- Never.
Went to my sister's place
at Folkestone for a bit.
Then I went in with a friend of mine,
and we opened a tea shop in Hythe.
- What happened to him?
- Dead as a doornail inside three years.
Well, I never.
Is tea bad for one?
Worse than coffee, I mean?
If this is a professional interview,
my fee is a guinea.
- Why did you become a doctor?
- That's a long story.
- Perhaps because I'm an idealist.
- I should think all doctors
ought to have ideals.
- Otherwise their work
would be unbearable.
- Encouraging me to talk shop?
It's what interests you most.
Yes, it is.
I'm terribly ambitious really.
Not ambitious for myself
so much as for my special pigeon.
- What is your special pigeon?
- Preventive medicine.
- I see.
- I'm afraid you don't.
- I was trying to be intelligent.
- Most good doctors,
especially when they're young,
have private dreams.
That's the best part of them.
Sometimes, though,
those get over-professionalized
and strangulated... am I boring you?
No, I don't quite understand,
but you're not boring me.
What I mean is this: All good doctors
must primarily be enthusiasts.
They must, like writers
and painters and priests...
they must have
a sense of vocation,
- a deep-rooted, unsentimental
desire to do good.
- Yes, I see that.
Well, obviously one way of preventing
disease is worth 50 ways of curing it.
That's where my ideal comes in.
Preventive medicine isn't
anything to do with medicine at all.
It's concerned with conditions... living
conditions, hygiene and common sense.
For instance,
my speciality is pneumoconiosis.
- Oh, dear.
- Don't be alarmed.
It's simpler than it sounds.
It's nothing but a slow process
of fibrosis of the lung...
due to the inhalation
of particles of dust.
In the hospital here there are
splendid opportunities for
observing cures, making notes...
- because of the coal mines.
- You suddenly look much younger.
- Do I?
- Almost like a little boy.
What made you say that?
I don't know. Yes, I do.
Tell me.
Oh, no, I couldn't, really.
You were saying about the coal mines.
Oh, yes, the inhalation
of coal dust.
What are the others?
Yes, of course, steel works.
And silicosis...
that's stone dust...
gold mines.
- I see.
-
- There's your train.
- Yes.
- You mustn't miss it.
- No.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing at all, really.
It's been so very nice.
I've enjoyed my afternoon enormously.
I'm so glad. So have I. I apologize
for boring you with long medical words.
I feel dull and stupid
not to be able to understand more.
Shall I see you again?
It's the other platform, isn't it?
You'll have to run.
Don't bother about me.
- Shall I see you again?
- Yes, of course. Perhaps you'd
come to Ketchworth one Sunday.
- It's rather far, I know,
but we should be delighted.
- Please, please.
- What is it?
- Next Thursday, the same time.
- No, I couldn't possibly.
-
I ask you most humbly.
-
- All right.
- Run. I'll be there.
- Good-bye.
Thank you, my dear.
-
- Good evening, Mrs. Jesson.
Oh, good evening.
Fred, what's the matter?
- It's all right, but you must
keep calm and not be upset.
- What is it? What's wrong?
It's Bobby. He was knocked down
by a car on the way home from school.
Now it's not serious.
He was just grazed by the mudguard,
but it knocked him against the curb,
and he's got slight concussion.
The doctor's upstairs
with him now.
You're sure?
You're sure it's not serious?
- Oh, good!
-
But he's much too young
to decide really.
Good life, if the boy has
a feeling for it.
How can he possibly really know
if he has a feeling for it?
He'll probably want to be
an engine driver next week.
No, it was last week
he wanted to be an engine driver.
It seems so final, somehow, entering
a child of that age for the navy.
- It's a healthy life.
- I know it's a good life,
and I know it's a healthy life,
and I know he'll be able to see the
world and have a wife in every port...
and keep on calling everybody "sir,"
but what about us?
- What do you mean, "What about us?"
-
- Oh, nonsense.
- It isn't nonsense.
He'll be sent away to sea
as a smooth-faced boy,
and the next thing we know,
he'll come walking in
with a long beard and a parrot.
I think you take rather
a Victorian view of the navy, my dear.
All right, old girl.
Then we'll put him into an office,
and you can see him off
on the 8:50 every morning.
And you can see him off
on the 8:50 every morning.
You really are very annoying. You know
perfectly well I should hate that.
All right,
have it your own way.
- Fred?
- Hmm?
I had lunch with a strange man today,
and he took me to the movies.
- Good for you.
- He's awfully nice. He's a doctor.
- A very noble profession.
- Oh, dear.
It  Richard III who said,
"My kingdom for a horse," wasn't it?
Well, I wish to goodness he hadn't
because it spoils everything.
I thought perhaps we might
ask him to dinner one night.
By all means.
Who?
Dr. Harvey... the one
I was telling you about.
- Must it be dinner?
- Well, you're never at home for lunch.
Exactly.
Oh, Fred.
Now what on earth's
the matter?
It's nothing.
It's only that... Oh, Fred.
I really don't see
what's so frightfully funny.
Oh, I do. It's all right, darling.
I'm not laughing at you.
I'm laughing at me.
I'm the one that's funny.
I'm an absolute idiot, worrying myself
about things that don't exist...
and making mountains
out of molehills.
I told you when you came in
that it was nothing serious.
I do see that now,
I really do.
- I couldn't resist.
- I'll trouble you to keep
your hands to yourself.
You're blushing.
You look wonderful when you're
angry, just like an avenging angel.
I'll give you avenging angel,
coming in here taking liberties.
I thought after what you said
last Monday you wouldn't object
to a friendly little slap.
Never you mind about last Monday.
I'm on duty now.
A nice thing if Mr. Saunders happened
to be looking through the window.
If Mr. Saunders is in the habit
of looking through windows,
it's about time he saw something
worth looking at.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- It's high spirits, don't be mad.
High spirits, indeed.
Take your tea, and be quiet.
- It's all your fault, really.
- I don't know to what you're referring.
I was thinking of tonight.
If you don't learn to behave there won't
be a tonight or any other night, either.
- Give us a kiss.
- I'll do no such thing.
The lady might see us.
- Come on, a quick one across the bar.
- Albert, stop it!
- Come, there's a love.
- Let go of me this minute.
Albert! Now look at me Banburys
all over the floor.
Just in time
or born in the vestry.
You shut your mouth and help
Mr. Godby pick up them cakes.
Come along now...
what are you standing there gaping at?
-
-
My dear, I'm so sorry.
I'd no way of letting you know.
- Your train, you'll miss it.
- The house surgeon
had to operate suddenly.
I was going to send a note
to the Kardomah, but I thought
they might shout your name.
Please don't say anymore.
- Quickly, quickly, the whistle's gone.
-
I'm so glad I had a chance to explain.
I didn't think I'd see you again.
How absurd.
Quickly, quickly.
- Next Thursday?
- Yes, next Thursday.
-
- Good-bye!
The stars can change in their courses,
the universe go up in flames,
and the world crash around us,
but there'll always be Donald Duck.
I do love him so... his dreadful energy,
his blind frustrated rages.
It's the big picture now. Here we go.
No more laughter. Prepare for tears.
You don't row
very well, do you?
I'm going to be perfectly honest
with you... I don't row at all,
and unless you want to go round
and round in ever-narrowing circles,
you'd better start steering.
- Oh, look out! We can't get through!
- Pull on your left!
Oh. Oh, dear, I never could
tell left from right.
I'm most awfully sorry.
-
-
You know the British have always
been nice to mad people.
That boatman thinks we are quite dotty,
but look how sweet he's been.
Tea, milk, even sugar.
Thank you.
You know what's happened,
don't you?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I've fallen in love
with you.
Yes, I know.
Tell me honestly. Please tell me
honestly if what I believe is true.
- What do you believe?
- That it's the same with you...
that you've fallen in love too.
- It sounds so silly.
- Why?
- I know you so little.
- It is true, though, isn't it?
- Yes, it's true.
- Laura.
No, please, we must be sensible.
Please help me to be sensible.
We mustn't behave like this. We must
forget that we've said what we've said.
- Not yet, not quite yet.
- But we must. Don't you see?
Listen, it's too late now
to be as sensible as all that.
It's too late to forget
what we've said,
and anyway, whether we'd said it or not
couldn't have mattered.
We know.
We've both of us known for a long time.
How can you say that?
I've only known you for four weeks.
We only talked for the first time
last Thursday week.
Last Thursday week. Has it been
a long time for you since then?
- Answer me truly.
- Yes.
How often did you decide that you were
never going to see me again?
- Several times a day. Oh, Alec.
- So did I.
I love you.
I love your wide eyes...
and the way you smile
and your shyness...
- and the way you laugh at my jokes.
- Please, don't.
I love you. I love you.
You love me too.
It's no use pretending
it hasn't happened, because it has.
Yes, it has.
I don't want to pretend anything either
to you or to anyone else,
but from now on,
I shall have to.
That's what's wrong, don't you see?
That's what spoils everything.
That's why we must stop
here and now talking like this.
We're neither of us free to love
each other. There's too much in the way.
There's still time,
if we control ourselves
and behave like sensible human beings.
There's still time to...
There's no time at all.
- There's your train.
- Yes.
I'll come over
to the platform with you.
No, Alec, not here.
Someone will see.
I love you so.
- Yes, dear?
- You were miles away.
Was I?
Yes, I suppose I was.
Do you mind if we turn that down
a little? It really is deafening.
No, of course not.
I shan't be long over this,
darling, then we'll go to bed.
You look a bit tired, you know?
Don't hurry.
I'm perfectly happy.
- Good evening, Mrs. Jesson.
- Hello, dear.
- Had a good day?
- Yes, lovely.
- What'd you do?
- Well, I shopped and had lunch
and went to the pictures.
- All by yourself?
- Yes.
Uh, no, not exactly.
What do you mean,
"not exactly"?
Well, I went to the pictures by myself,
but I had lunch with Mary Norton.
She couldn't come to the pictures
'cause she had to see her in-laws.
They live just outside
Milford, you know?
So I walked with her to the bus
and then came home on my own.
I haven't seen Mary Norton for ages.
How is she looking?
Very well, really.
A little fatter, I thought.
Hurry up with all this beautifying.
I want my dinner.
You go on down.
I won't be five minutes.
-  Number, please?
- Ketchworth 3-7, please.
Ketchworth 3-7.
-  Hello?
- Hello, is Mrs. Norton there, please?
- Yes. Will you hold on?
- Yes, I'll hold on.
- Hello?
- Hello? Is that you, Mary?
Oh, Laura! Fancy hearing from you.
I thought you were dead.
No, I haven't seen you for ages.
Listen, my dear,
will you be a saint and back me up
in the most appalling domestic lie?
- As bad as all that?
- My life depends on it.
Well, today, I went into Milford,
as usual, to do my shopping.
With the special intention
of buying a far too expensive
present for Fred's birthday.
Well, Spink and Robson's
hadn't got what I wanted,
which was one of those clocks
with barometers and everything in one,
but they rang up their branch in
Broadham and said there was one there,
so I hopped on the 1:30 train
and went to get it.
- Go on.
- Well, this is where
the black lie comes in.
Fred asked me if I'd had a good day,
and I said yes,
and that you and I had lunch and
that you had gone to see your in-laws...
and I had gone
to the pictures.
- If you run into him,
don't let me down, will you?
- Darling, of course not.
- I'll do as much for you, I promise.
- Let's really lunch one day.
- Yes, that'd be lovely.
- What about next Thursday?
No, I can't on Thursday. That's
my Milford day. What about Friday?
- Fine, better make it here.
- All right, perfect.
You know what my cook's like.
It'll have to be early.
Yes, all right.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I thought you wouldn't come.
I've been thinking all week
that you wouldn't come.
I didn't mean to really,
but here I am.
Laura! So it was you after all.
Hermione said it was.
- How are you?
- You know how shortsighted I am.
I peered and peered
and still couldn't be sure.
I never saw you at all. How awful of me.
I expect it was the champagne.
I'm not used to champagne for lunch
or for dinner either, but Alec insisted.
Alec? Alec who, dear?
Alec Harvey, of course.
Surely you remember the Harveys.
I've known them for years.
- No, I don't think I ever...
- He'll be back in a minute.
You'll probably recognize him
when you peer very closely.
He looks very charming
and very attentive.
He's a dear. One of the nicest people
in the world and a wonderful doctor.
- Oh, Alec, you remember
Mrs. Norton, don't you?
- I'm afraid I don't.
It's no use, Laura.
We've never seen each other
before in our lives, I'm sure.
How absurd. I made certain
he and Madeleine were there
when you dined with us...
just before Christmas
last year.
- Alec, this is Mrs. Rolandson.
- How do you do?
- Horrid weather, isn't it?
- Yes.
Of course, one can't really
expect spring at this time
of the year, can one?
- No.
-
Well, we must be going.
I'm taking Hermione with me
to the in-laws as moral support.
- Good-bye, Dr. Harvey.
Good-bye, my dear.
- Good-bye.
- I do so envy you your champagne.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye.
- That was awful.
- Never mind.
They had been watching us
all through lunch. Oh, dear.
Forget it. Come out
and look at the surprise.
- Cold?
- No, not really.
Happy?
No, not really.
I know exactly what
you're going to say.
That it isn't worth it.
That the furtiveness and lying outweigh
the happiness we might have together.
Isn't that it?
Something like that.
I want to ask you something,
just to reassure myself.
What is it?
It is true for you, isn't it?
This overwhelming feeling
we have for each other...
it's as true for you
as it is for me, isn't it?
Yes, it's true.
I'm going back.
I'm going to miss my train.
- Back where?
- To Stephen's flat.
- Oh, Alec.
Alec, I must go home now.
I really must go home.
A cup of tea, please.
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon, lady.
- Afternoon.
- Couple of whiskeys, please.
- Very sorry. It's out of hours.
Well, just sneak 'em to us under
the cover of them poor old sandwiches.
Them sandwiches were fresh this morning,
and I shall do no such thing.
- Come on, be a sport.
- You can have as much
as you want after 6:00.
My throat's like a parrot's cage.
Listen.
I'm sorry. My license does not
permit me to serve alcohol out of hours.
That's final. You wouldn't want
to get me into trouble, would you?
Just give us the chance, lady. That's
all we ask. Just give us the chance.
- Beryl!
- Yes, Mrs. Bagot?
- Ask Mr. Godby to come here
a moment, will you?
- Yes, Mrs. Bagot.
- Oh, and who's he when he's at home?
- You'll soon see.
- Coming in here cheeking me.
-
- I'll give you "Mother,"
you saucy upstart.
- Oi, who you callin' an upstart?
You! And I'll trouble you
to get out of here double quick.
Disturbing the customers and
making a nuisance of yourselves.
Here, where's the fire,
where's the fire?
- What's going on in here?
- Mr. Godby,
these gentlemen are annoying me.
- What? We haven't done nothing,
have we, Johnnie?
- All we did was ask for drinks.
- They insulted me, Mr. Godby.
-
- Just having a little joke, that's all.
- Hop it, both of you.
- We've got a right to stay here
as long as we like.
- You heard what I said. Hop it.
Now, look here. What is this, a free
country or a bloomin' Sunday school?
- Now, look here...
- Aw, come on, Johnnie. Come on.
- Don't argue with the poor basket.
- Hop it.
And if them sandwiches were made
this morning, you're Shirley Temple.
- Thank you, Albert.
- What a nerve... talking to you
like that, Mrs. Bagot.
Be quiet, Beryl. Pour me out a nip
of Three Star. I'm feeling quite upset.
- I have to get back to the gate.
- I'll be seeing you later, Albert.
Okay.
-
-
-
-
Excuse me.
I've forgotten something.
Darling.
It's raining.
It started just as I turned out
of the High Street.
You had no umbrella,
and your coat's wet.
You mustn't catch cold.
That would never do.
- I look an absolute fright.
- Let me put that down for you.
Thank you.
I hope the fire will
perk up in a few minutes.
- I expect the wood was damp.
- Yes, I expect it was.
Do sit down, darling.
I got right into the train and then
got out again. Wasn't it idiotic?
We're both very,
very foolish.
- Alec, I can't stay, you know.
Really, I can't.
- Just a little while.
- Just a little while.
-
Quickly, quickly!
I must go.
-
- Here, through the kitchen.
There's a tradesman's staircase.
-
- Yes.
- You're back early.
- Yes, I felt a cold coming on,
so I denied myself
the questionable pleasure of dining...
with that arch-arguer Roger Hinchley
and decided to come back to bed.
- Inflamed membranes are
unsympathetic to a dialectic.
- What'll you do about food?
I can always ring down to the restaurant
if I want any later on.
- We live in a modern age,
and this  a service flat.
- Yes, yes, of course.
It caters for all tastes.
You know, my dear Alec, you have hidden
depths which I never even suspected.
-
- Oh, for heaven's sake, Alec.
No explanations or apologies.
I am the one who should apologize
for returning so inopportunely.
It's quite obvious to me that you were
interviewing a patient privately.
By the rather undignified scuffling
which I heard when I came into the hall,
I gather that she beat
a hasty retreat down the back stairs.
I'm surprised at this farcical streak
in your nature, Alec.
Such carryings-on are quite unnecessary.
After all, we've been friends for years,
and I am the most
broad-minded of men.
I'm really very sorry,
Stephen.
I'm sure that the whole situation
must seem inexpressibly vulgar to you.
Actually,
it isn't in the least.
However, you're perfectly right:
Explanations are unnecessary,
particularly between friends.
- I must go now.
I'll collect my hat and coat.
- Very well.
- Good-bye.
- Perhaps you'll let me
have my latchkey back.
I only have two,
and I'm so afraid of losing them.
You know how absentminded I am.
- You're very angry, aren't you?
- No, Alec, not angry, just disappointed.
Hello, Fred, is that you?
Yes, dear, it's me, Laura.
Yes, everything's perfectly all right,
but I shan't be home to dinner.
I'm with Miss Lewis.
Miss Lewis, dear. You know,
the librarian I told you about at Boots.
Y-Yes, I can't explain in any detail
because she's outside the box now.
I met her in the High Street a little
while ago in a terrible state.
Her mother's been taken ill,
and I've promised to stay
with her until the doctor comes.
Yes, I know, but she's always
been awfully kind to me,
and I feel so sorry for her.
No, I'll get a sandwich, but
ask Ethel to leave me some soup
in a saucepan in the kitchen.
Yes, of course,
as soon as I can.
All right. Good-bye.
Feeling all right, miss?
- Yes, thank you.
- Waiting for someone?
No. No, I'm not
waiting for anybody.
Don't go and catch cold now. It's a damp
night for sitting about on seats.
I'm going now anyhow.
I've got to catch a train.
You're sure you feel
quite all right?
Quite, thank you.
Good night.
Good night, miss.
Stan, you are awful.
Stan, you are awful.
- See ya in the yard.
- All right.
- I'd like a glass of brandy, please.
- We're just closin'.
Yes, I see you are, but you're
not quite closed yet, are you?
- Three Star?
- That'll do.
Oh, and have you got
a piece of paper and an envelope?
- I'm afraid you'll have to
get that at the book stall.
- Well, the book stall's closed.
Please, it's very important.
I should be so much obliged.
All right.
Just a minute.
- Thank you very much.
-
Yes, I know.
- Darling, I've been
looking for you everywhere.
- Please go away. Please don't.
- I've watched every train.
- Please go away.
- I can't leave you like this.
- You must. It'll be better,
really it will.
You're being dreadfully cruel.
It was just an accident
that he came back early.
- He doesn't know who you are.
He never even saw you.
- He laughed, didn't he?
- I suppose you spoke of me
together as men of the world.
- We didn't speak of you.
- We spoke of some nameless
creature who has no reality.
- Why didn't you tell him?
Why didn't you say we were cheap
and low and without courage?
- Stop it, Laura. Pull yourself together.
- It's true.
It's nothing of the sort.
We know we love each other.
That's all that matters.
It isn't all that matters.
Other things matter too.
Self-respect matters, and decency.
I can't go on any longer.
Could you really say good-bye,
never see me again?
Yes, if you'd help me.
I love you, Laura. I shall love you
always until the end of my life.
I can't look at you now
because I know something.
I know that this is
the beginning of the end...
not the end of my loving you,
the end of our being together.
But not quite yet, darling.
Please, not quite yet.
Very well.
Not quite yet.
I know what you feel about this
evening... about the sordidness of it.
I know about the strain of our different
lives... our lives apart from each other.
The feeling of guilt, doing wrong
is too strong, isn't it?
Too great a price to pay
for the happiness we have together.
I know all this
because it's the same for me too.
You can look at me now.
I'm all right.
Let's be very careful.
Let's prepare ourselves.
A sudden break now, however brave
and admirable, would be too cruel.
We can't do such violence
to our hearts and minds.
- Very well.
-
- I'm going away.
- I see.
- But not quite yet.
- Please, not quite yet.
- That's the 10:10.
It's after closing time.
- Oh, is it?
- I shall have to lock up.
- All right.
- I want you to promise me something.
- What is it?
Promise me that however
unhappy you are...
and however much
you think things over,
- that you'll meet me
again next Thursday.
- Where?
Outside the hospital
at 12:30.
- All right. I promise.
- I've got to talk to you.
I've got to explain.
- About going away?
- Yes.
- Where will you go?
Where  you go?
- You can't give up your practice.
I've had a job offered me.
I wasn't going to tell you.
I wasn't going to take it,
but I know now it's the only way out.
- Where?
- A long way away... Johannesburg.
- Oh, Alec.
- My brother's out there.
They're opening a new hospital.
They want me in it.
It's a fine opportunity, really.
I'll take Madeleine and the boys.
It's been torturing me...
the necessity of making
a decision one way or the other.
I haven't told anybody,
not even Madeleine.
I couldn't bear
the thought of leaving you,
but now I see it's
got to happen soon anyway.
It's almost happening already.
-
-
When will you go?
Almost immediately,
in about two weeks' time.
- Quite near, isn't it?
- Do you want me to stay?
- Do you want me to turn down the offer?
- Don't be foolish, Alec.
- I'll do whatever you say.
- That's unkind of you, my darling.
You're not
angry with me, are you?
No, I'm not angry.
I don't think I'm anything, really.
I just feel tired.
- Forgive me?
- Forgive you for what?
For everything...
for meeting you in the first place,
for taking the piece
of grit out of your eye,
for loving you,
for bringing you so much misery.
I'll forgive you
if you'll forgive me.
Are you all right,
darling?
Yes, I'm all right.
I wish I could think of something
to say. It doesn't matter...
- not saying anything, I mean.
- I'll miss my train
and see you to yours.
- Please don't. I'll come over
to your platform. I'd rather.
- Very well.
Do you think we shall ever
see each other again?
I don't know.
Not for years anyway.
The children will
all be grown up.
I wonder if they'll ever
meet and know each other.
Couldn't I write to you,
just once in a while?
No, Alec, please.
You know we promised.
Well, all right, dear.
I do love you so very much.
I love you with
all my heart and soul.
I want to die.
If only I could die.
If you died, you'd forget me.
I want to be remembered.
Yes, I know. I do too.
- We've still got a few minutes.
-
My dear, I've been
shopping till I'm dropping.
My feet are nearly falling off.
My throat's parched.
I thought of having tea at Spindle's,
but I was terrified of losing the train.
- Oh, dear!
- Oh, this is Dr. Harvey.
- How do you do?
- How do you do? Would you be
a dear and get me a cup of tea?
- I don't think I could drag
my poor bones to the counter.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
- There's your train.
- Yes, I know.
- Oh, aren't you coming with us?
- I go in the opposite direction.
My practice is in Churley.
- Oh, I see.
- I'm a general practitioner
at the moment.
- Dr. Harvey's going out
to Africa next week.
- Oh, how thrilling.
- I must go. Good-bye.
- Yes, you must.
Good-bye.
He's got to get
right over to the other platform.
Talking of missing trains reminds me of
that awful bridge at Broadham Junction.
-
-
-
-
-
-
Is that the train? Oh, can you tell me,
is that the Ketchworth train?
-
- The boat train.
That doesn't stop,
does it?
That doesn't stop,
does it?
-
-
Laura.
Yes, dear?
Whatever your dream was,
it wasn't a very happy one, was it?
No.
Is there anything
I can do to help?
Yes, Fred.
You always help.
You've been
a long way away.
Yes.
Thank you for coming
back to me.
