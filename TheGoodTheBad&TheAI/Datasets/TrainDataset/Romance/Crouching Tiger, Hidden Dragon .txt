Master Li is here!
2
Shu Lien!
3
Li Mu Bai is here!
4
- How's everything?
- Fine. Please come in.
5
Mu Bai...
It's been too long.
6
It has.
7
- How's business?
- Good.
8
- And how are you?
- Fine.
9
Monk Zheng said
you were at Wudan Mountain.
10
He said you were practicing
deep meditation.
11
The mountain
must be so peaceful...
12
I envy you.
13
My work keeps me so busy,
I hardly get any rest.
14
I left the training early.
15
Why? You're a Wudan fighter.
Training is everything.
16
During my meditation training...
17
I came to a place
of deep silence...
18
I was surrounded by light...
19
Time and space disappeared.
20
I had come to a place my master
had never told me about.
21
You were enlightened?
22
No.
23
I didn't feel the bliss
of enlightement.
24
Instead... I was surrounded
by an endless sorrow.
25
I couldn't bear it.
26
I broke off my meditation.
27
I couldn't go on.
28
There was something...
pulling me back.
29
What was it ?
30
Something I can't let go of.
31
You're leaving soon?
32
We're preparing a convoy
for a delivery...
33
to Peking.
34
Perhaps I could ask you...
35
to deliver something
to Sir Te for me.
36
The Green Destiny sword?
You're giving it to Sir Te?
37
I am. He has always been
our greatest protector.
38
I don't understand.
How can you part with it?
39
It has always been with you.
40
Too many men have died
at its edge.
41
It only looks pure because blood
washes so easily from its blade.
42
You use it justly,
you're worthy of it.
43
It's time for me
to leave it behind.
44
So what will you do now?
45
Come with me to Peking.
46
You can give the sword to Sir Te
yourself.
47
It'll be just like old times.
48
First I must visit
my master's grave.
49
It's been many years since...
50
Jade Fox murdered him.
I have yet to avenge his death.
51
And yet I'm thinking of quitting.
52
I must pray for his forgiveness.
53
Join me
once you have finished.
54
I can wait for you in Peking.
55
Perhaps.
56
Okay. Pass.
57
Thanks.
58
Let's go into the city.
59
Everything got here safely.
I'm much obliged.
60
Just doing my job.
61
Sun Security has been the best
since your father started it.
62
You're a credit to his memory.
63
Thank you.
64
I mean it.
65
This is Li Mu Bai's
personal sword,
66
a great hero's weapon.
67
He is the only one in the world
worthy of carrying it.
68
It's too fine a gift.
I cannot accept it.
69
Sir Te...
70
It has brought him
as much trouble as glory.
71
Help him to leave
these troubles behind.
72
Otherwise, he'll never be able
to start a new.
73
All right.
74
I'll act as the sword's custodian.
75
Governor Yu has arrived.
76
I must change.
77
You've always been so good
to Li Mu Bai and me.
78
Please accept our thanks.
79
Please do not be such a stranger.
You'll stay the night as my guest.
80
Now, Shu Lien...
81
tell me something.
82
And forgive me for prying.
83
Your father
was a great friend to me,
84
and I think of you
as my own daughter.
85
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
86
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword...
87
and his warrior days...
88
Maybe he's trying
to tell you something?
89
I don't know...
90
Don't be coy. I've always known
about your feelings for each other.
91
All these years, it's a shame...
92
neither of you is brave enough
to admit the truth to the other.
93
You're both wasting precious time.
94
I beg your pardon.
Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
95
When it comes to emotions,
96
even great heroes can be idiots.
97
Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more
open the next time you see him.
98
I'll give him an earful!
99
Sir Te said
to leave the sword in here.
100
Who are you?
101
I'm your guest today.
102
I am Governor Yu's daughter.
103
This is Sir Te's study.
You are here to...?
104
I was just looking
for a quiet corner.
105
I am Sir Te's head servant.
106
And this is another of our guests.
107
It's heavy
for such a thin piece of metal!
108
The handle is heavy.
And the blade is no ordinary metal.
109
Still, the sword
is the lightest of weapons.
110
You're just not used
to handling it.
111
But, I have had much practice.
112
As a child in the West,
a platoon lived with us.
113
They'd let me play
with their weapons.
114
The scabbard is so beautiful.
115
Beautiful but dangerous.
116
Once you see it tainted with blood,
its beauty is hard to admire.
117
It's 40000 years old.
118
Exquisite!
119
You said it belongs to...
120
My friend Li Mu Bai.
He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
121
Li Mu Bai!
122
The famous warrior?
123
Why would he give his sword
to Sir Te?
124
You're too young to understand.
125
You're a sword fighter too?
126
Yes, I am.
127
But I prefer the machete.
128
Certain moves, however,
call for a sword.
129
Really?
130
It must be exciting to be
a fighter, to be totally free!
131
Fighters have rules too:
friendship, trust...
132
integrity.
Without rules...
133
we wouldn't survive for long.
134
I've read
all about people like you.
135
Roaming wild, beating up anyone
who gets in your way!
136
Writers wouldn't sell many books
if they told how it really is.
137
But you're just like
the characters in the stories.
138
Sure. No place to bathe for days,
sleeping in flea-infested beds...
139
They tell you all about that
in those books?
140
You know what I mean.
141
I'm getting married soon, but
I haven't lived the life I want.
142
So I heard.
Congratulations.
143
It's the most important step
in a woman's life, isn't it?
144
You're not married, are you?
145
What do you think?
146
No! You couldn't roam around
freely if you were.
147
You're probably right.
148
TE'S
149
Go ahead, Governor Yu.
150
151
152
The handle is 1 inch deep,
153
154
With seven rubies missing
from the hilt.
155
You can tell the design
156
dates back
to before the Chin era.
157
Engraved with a technique lost
by the time of the Han Dynasty.
158
Your knowledge is remarkable,
Sir Te.
159
A sword by itself rules nothing.
160
It comes alive
only through skillful manipulation.
161
I see your point.
Please continue.
162
The Imperial Court
isn't the problem.
163
With royalty and officials
everywhere...
164
the Royal Guard
keeps security tight.
165
But Peking is not like the West.
166
Here, you'll find
all sorts of characters.
167
Proceed with caution
in your quest for law and order.
168
Don't depend only on the court.
169
Contacts
in the Giang Hu underworld...
170
can ensure your position.
171
Be strong yet supple.
172
This is the way to rule.
173
Governess...
174
Let me do it.
175
Please sit.
176
I've made you silk pajamas.
Do you want to change into them?
177
Put them down.
178
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
179
Do you know her?
180
She's one of those.
181
Your mother would not want you
consorting with her kind.
182
I'll socialize
with whomever I please.
183
Don't invite danger
into your father's house.
184
I'm tired now!
185
Go to bed then.
186
Miss has grown up,
and is getting married soon.
187
God knows
what the future will bring.
188
It'll be just the same.
189
Enough! I'm tired.
190
Autumn is coming.
191
I'll shut the windows for you.
192
- Chilly, eh?
- Yes, Master Bo.
193
Someone help!
194
Stop him!
195
He's on the roof!
196
The sword's been stolen!
197
Stop thief!
198
Stop him!
199
It's Jade Fox!
200
We must avenge Mother!
201
Do something!
He's getting away!
202
Return the sword
and I'll let you go.
203
You've been trained at Wudan?
204
You're mistaken.
205
We're just street performers.
We were rehearsing.
206
Father!
207
You were rehearsing?
208
Who are you trying to fool?
209
Where did that thief go?
210
Governor Yu's house!
211
Get down here!
212
Give back the sword!
213
Sir Te awaits you.
214
I'm sure the thief
is in the Yu household.
215
How dare you imply?
216
Enough!
217
Has Governor Yu
ever seen the sword?
218
Yes, though I doubt
he's involved in this.
219
But the sword
could be in his compound.
220
Then someone's trying
to set him up.
221
We should inform Li Mu Bai.
222
What is it?
223
Madam Yu,
someone's put up posters.
224
Let me see.
225
Someone is after a Jade Fox.
226
Preposterous, looking for her here!
227
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
228
I haven't seen them in two days.
229
There's a Miss Shu Lien here
to see you.
230
Miss is busy right now.
231
I'll tell her.
232
Show her in.
233
This spells trouble.
234
I have a guest.
235
This way please.
236
I've missed you.
237
How so?
238
I'm bored...
239
You're doing calligraphy?
240
I'll write your name.
241
Just for fun.
242
I never realized my name
looks like ''sword.''
243
You write gracefully. Calligraphy
is so similar to fencing.
244
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.
245
Please.
246
Thank you for seeing me.
I hear your wedding day is near.
247
You must be overwhelmed
by the preparations.
248
I'm hardly doing a thing.
The less I think of it the better.
249
My parents
are arranging everything.
250
The Gous are a very powerful family.
251
My marrying one will be good
for my father's career.
252
You are fortunate
to marry into such a noble family.
253
Am I?
254
I wish I were like the heroes
in the books I read.
255
Like you and Li Mu Bai.
256
I guess I'm happy to be marrying.
257
But to be free
to live my own life...
258
to choose whom I love...
259
That is true happiness.
260
Do you think so?
Let me tell you a story--
261
About you and Li Mu Bai?
262
Yes.
263
Did you know I was once engaged
to be married?
264
No, really?
265
His name was Meng Si Zhao.
266
He was a brother to Li Mu Bai
by oath.
267
One day, while in battle...
268
he was killed by the sword
of Li Mu Bai's enemy.
269
After, Li Mu Bai and I
went through a lot together.
270
Our feelings for each other
grew stronger.
271
But how could we dishonor...
272
Meng's memory?
273
So the freedom
you talk about, I too desire it.
274
But I have never tasted it.
275
Too bad for Meng, but it's not
your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
276
I am not an aristocrat,
as you are...
277
but I must still respect
a woman's duties.
278
Don't distance us.
279
From now on, let's be like sisters.
280
Then as a sister, let me wish you
happiness in your marriage.
281
What a godforsaken place!
282
Can't your father be appointed
closer to civilization?
283
Jen...
284
are you listening to me?
285
Let's go.
286
Who are you?
287
Wait! I'm a friend!
288
I don't care about your sword.
289
Why were you spying on the Yus?
290
I'm looking for someone.
Jade Fox.
291
I'm a police inspector
from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.
292
Jade Fox is a master criminal.
I hear she infiltrated the Yus.
293
She must have come with them
when they transferred here.
294
But with Yu's reputation,
I can't just go in and accuse her.
295
- This Jade Fox is a woman?
- Yes.
296
Then leave her to me.
297
Pardon me,
but I doubt you can handle her.
298
My wife was
quite a martial arts expert.
299
Jade Fox killed her.
300
So you see...
301
this is personal.
Leave her to me.
302
It's ready.
303
I'm ready for anything!
304
Father gets first dip.
305
They're gone!
306
What does it say?
307
''We'll settle this at midnight
on Yellow Hill.''
308
Good! The fox is out of her hole!
309
Shu Lien, look who's here.
310
Sir Te believes it's a ploy
to cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
311
But something is going on
at the Yu household.
312
What have you discovered?
313
Jade Fox?
314
Impossible!
315
You'd always suspected
she'd fled to the West.
316
I didn't think she'd dare
come back to Peking!
317
Is there any place safer
than under the nose of Governor Yu?
318
So I shall avenge
my master's death after all.
319
Be careful.
320
Sir Te requires discretion.
321
Official business
is difficult enough.
322
Don't let personal feelings
make it worse.
323
And I don't know...
even this poster...
324
could be some sort of trap.
325
Did you see who posted it?
326
No.
327
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.
328
On the night of the theft
there was a brawl near Yu's.
329
Were you involved?
330
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.
331
I hear he followed the thief
to the Yu's.
332
Have you questioned him yet?
333
No, not yet...
334
But your men are watching over
Yu's compound?
335
No, I'd already sent them home.
336
You can blame me
for losing the sword...
337
but please trust
that I'll get it back soon...
338
using my own methods.
339
That's not what I meant.
340
I don't care about the sword.
341
What do you mean?
Didn't you come back here for it?
342
I didn't know it was stolen
until I got here.
343
Then, why did you come?
344
Well, we had talked--
345
Pardon my intrusion.
Master Li...
346
your room is ready.
347
Thank you.
348
Please, lead the way.
349
The Fox doesn't care much
for punctuality.
350
Still no sign of her.
351
Enough! Show yourself!.
352
Tsai...
353
You dog!
354
You will pay
for your stubborness!
355
That's what you think, old witch!
356
If you surrender now,
you'll suffer less.
357
But if you resist,
I won't stop until you're dead.
358
Father!
359
Let me avenge my mother's death!
360
You'll soon end up like her,
you little whore!
361
You'll pay for that!
362
She's going to paralyze you!
363
May!
364
Tsai, you filthy mongrel!
365
An ambush!
366
Father, are you all right?
367
Wudan should have gotten
rid of you long ago.
368
It's been a long time, Jade Fox!
369
You don't remember me...
370
But you should
remember my master.
371
You infiltrated Wudan
while I was away.
372
You stole our secret manual...
373
and poisoned our master!
374
Now it's time for you to pay!
375
Your master
underestimated us women.
376
Sure, he'd sleep with me,
but he would never teach me.
377
He deserved to die
by a woman's hand!
378
You stole the secrets
of Wudan's highest martial arts.
379
But after ten years of training
your moves are still undisciplined.
380
And today...
381
under a Wudan sword...
382
you will die!
383
Disciple, we'll kill them all!
384
Let's go!
385
Another one!
386
I must get rid of Tsai!
387
Who are you?
388
Why is the Green Destiny
in your possession?
389
What's it to you?
390
My name is Li Mu Bai.
391
The Green Destiny is mine.
392
Jade Fox can't be your master.
393
Where did you learn
that ''Xuan Piu'' move?
394
I'm just playing around.
395
Tell me, who is your master?
396
- Let's go!
- We must kill them!
397
Father!
398
This is Tsai?
399
My father.
400
Police inspector from Shaan.
401
This should be reported
to Governor Yu.
402
The victim is an officer.
403
You believe the killer
is hiding out in his compound?
404
I'd bet my life on it!
405
Come with me.
406
This needs to be resolved,
and quickly.
407
I'll get into the Yu household
and get her.
408
I'll ferret out Fox and her gang.
409
We must be careful.
410
Yu is a court official,
and in charge of security.
411
Any disturbance
will cast suspicion on him.
412
It might get Sir Te in trouble.
413
This is a delicate matter.
414
Sir Te, can you find some excuse...
415
to invite
Madam Yu and her daughter?
416
What do you have in mind?
417
The best way to trap a fox
is through her cubs.
418
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
with these wedding gifts.
419
She's being so considerate.
420
I'm sorry she's not feeling
well enough to receive you today.
421
I heard Sir Te lost something.
422
And now Madam Te's
not feeling well...
423
We know who stole
the missing item.
424
If the thief returns it,
I'm sure Sir Te will pursue...
425
the matter no further.
426
That's good.
427
Sometimes the help can't keep
their hands to themselves.
428
It's very embarrassing.
429
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
people can make mistakes...
430
that can bring ruin to themselves
and their families.
431
But don't be too lenient.
432
No mercy will be shown
toward the murderer...
433
who turned up in Peking.
434
A murderer?
435
Yes...
436
the very killer
of Li Mu Bai's own master.
437
Last night...
438
she killed a policeman
who had tracked her down.
439
A female criminal!
Now that's news!
440
You say she killed
a policeman?
441
Yes, from the West.
442
He went undercover,
and followed her here.
443
Maybe the murderer...
444
and the thief are the same.
445
I doubt that.
446
This thief...
447
is very unusual.
448
And most likely smarter
than a mere killer.
449
Greetings, Sir Te.
450
Hello, Madam Yu.
451
This is Li Mu Bai...
452
the renowned swordsman.
453
Delighted to meet you.
454
Miss Yu is soon to be married.
455
Congratulations.
456
Why don't you come in?
457
I'm standing guard.
458
Come in. It's cold.
459
Come in.
460
We don't have to fear Jade Fox
if we're together.
461
Isn't it a bit late to be out?
462
You've brought me the sword?
463
I do as I please.
464
Where is your master?
465
What's it to you?
466
Had enough flying?
467
You've got potential.
468
You've studied the Wudan manual
but you don't understand it.
469
You need a real master.
470
Do you think
you are a real master?
471
Like most things,
I am nothing.
472
It's the same for this sword.
473
All of it is simply
a state of mind.
474
Stop talking like a monk!
475
Just fight!
476
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
477
On guard!
478
Real sharpness
comes without effort.
479
No growth.
480
Without assistance.
481
No action.
482
Without reaction.
483
No desire without restraint.
484
Now give yourself up
and find yourself again.
485
There is a lesson for you.
486
Go ahead.
487
Why should I?
488
You need practice. I can teach you
to fight with the Green Destiny,
489
but first you must learn
to hold it in stillness.
490
Why do you want to teach me?
491
I've always wanted a disciple...
492
worthy of Wudan's secrets.
493
And if I use them
to kill you?
494
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
495
Deep down, you're good.
Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
496
Wudan is a whorehouse!
497
Keep your lessons!
498
You're home late...
499
or should I say early?
500
Why are you still here?
You killed a policeman.
501
You should leave!
502
You'll bring ruin
on my whole family.
503
They wouldn't have found me
if you hadn't stolen the sword.
504
Like a little girl,
you thought stealing would be fun?
505
You, too, are responsible
for that death. Come with me.
506
You don't want to waste your life
as the wife of some bureaucrat.
507
Denied your talent...
508
As master and disciple
we will rule.
509
I'll never live as a thief!.
510
You're already a thief.
511
That was just for fun.
512
How can I leave?
Where would I go?
513
Wherever we want.
514
We'll get rid of anyone
in our way.
515
Even your father.
516
Shut up!
517
It's the Giang Hu fighter
lifestyle... kill or be killed.
518
Exciting, isn't it?
519
I owe you nothing.
520
Yes, you do!
521
You are still my disciple.
522
You think you've been teaching me
all these years from the manual?
523
You couldn't even
decipher the symbols!
524
I studied the diagrams.
525
But you hid the details!
526
You wouldn't have understood,
even if I had tried to explain.
527
You know...
528
you've gone as far as you can go.
529
I hid my skills
so as not to hurt you.
530
If I hadn't seen you
fight with Li Mu Bai...
531
I'd still be ignorant
of all you've hidden from me.
532
Master...
533
I started learning from you
in secret when I was 1 00.
534
You enchanted me
with the world of Giang Hun.
535
But once I realized
I could surpass you...
536
I became so frightened!
537
Everything fell apart.
538
I had no one to guide me...
539
no one to learn from.
540
Believe me...
541
I've a lesson or two left
to teach you!
542
The sword is back...
543
Are you happy?
544
I admit...
545
getting it back makes me realize
how much I'd missed it.
546
But it's not your sword anymore.
547
You gave it to Sir Te.
548
True.
549
But I must borrow it
for one last mission.
550
Jade Fox must die at its edge.
551
Did you know what you were hiding
when you covered for that girl?
552
My job was to get the sword back,
without embarrassing anyone.
553
I wasn't about to ruin...
554
her life, or her father's.
555
You did your job well.
556
But, this girl...
557
I saw her last night.
558
I knew she would intrigue you.
559
She needs direction...
560
and training.
561
She's an aristocrat's daughter.
She's not one of us.
562
In any case,
it will all be over soon.
563
You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
564
That's not for her.
565
She should come to Wudan
and become a disciple.
566
But Wudan does not accept women.
567
For her, they might
make an exception.
568
If not, I'm afraid she'll become
a poisoned dragon.
569
It's not our affair.
570
Even if Wudan accepts her,
her husband might object.
571
I thought by giving away the sword,
572
I could escape the Giang Hu world.
573
But the cycle of bloodshed
continues.
574
I wish there were something more...
575
I could do to help you.
576
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
577
Lo?
578
Jen!
579
You shouldn't have come.
580
With all the traffic
on your rooftop these days...
581
it took me a while
to get in here.
582
I can't wait any longer.
583
I was wrong to let you go.
584
Come back with me.
585
You'll be happy in the desert.
586
You'll be free there.
587
You've been looking for me
all this time?
588
Jen...
589
Stop playing with it.
590
I won't break it.
591
It's Dark Cloud!
592
Dark Cloud is coming!
593
Lower the shade,
don't let them see you!
594
Don't touch the women!
595
Let's go!
596
Come get your comb.
597
Hurry back to your mother.
598
She's mine!
599
Leave her to me!
600
Come and get it!
601
Give me back my comb!
602
Let's stop a moment.
603
Give it back!
604
You're tired. You need rest.
605
Your horse needs water.
There's a creek up here.
606
Well, there used to be!
607
What's your name?
608
I'm Lo.
609
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.
610
I'm not that tall or big...
611
but I'm quick as lightning.
612
My comb!
613
If you like that arrow,
I can make you a bow.
614
Great for hunting wild chicken.
615
They're delicious.
616
You need to eat.
Understand?
617
Then you'll have
the strength to fight.
618
Understand?
619
You're eating too fast.
620
Slowly.
621
You've got quite a temper.
622
It's better this way...
623
You coward!
624
Still in a bad mood?
625
At least you're speaking.
626
What's your name?
627
I didn't think the Hans
had names like that.
628
Relax.
629
If I had wanted to, I would
already have done it.
630
You must be dying for a bath.
631
Fresh water's hard to get here.
632
But I managed to bring some up.
633
You can wear my clothes
when you're done.
634
They're clean.
635
Don't worry.
636
I'll sing,
so you'll know where I am.
637
After the bath,
you'll be calmer.
638
No more hitting on the head!
639
All this trouble for a comb?
640
It's mine.
641
It means a lot to me. A barbarian
like you wouldn't understand.
642
Not true. I can use it
to pick fleas from my horse.
643
By the way,
I'm a real Manchurian.
644
I'm sorry...
645
I guessed wrong.
646
I thought you were a Han.
647
Give me back my comb.
648
I don't take orders from anyone.
649
Give it back.
650
One night...
651
when I was a boy, I saw
a thousand shooting stars.
652
I thought,
''Where did they all go?''
653
I'm an orphan.
I used to look for stars alone.
654
I thought if I rode to the other
end of the desert, I'd find them.
655
I've been riding in the desert
ever since.
656
And so, the little boy
became a fearsome bandit.
657
He couldn't find the stars,
so he stole my comb.
658
Out here, you always fight
for survival.
659
You have to be part of a gang
to stand a chance.
660
Slowly,
your gang becomes your family.
661
All that Dark Cloud stuff
is just to scare people...
662
and make my life easier.
663
So you are still that little boy...
664
looking for shooting stars.
665
I am a man.
666
And now I've found
the brightest star of all.
667
Your father's men
are looking for you.
668
They're still out there,
circling closer.
669
Let them look.
670
It is trouble for me.
671
Don't send me back.
672
You must decide.
673
You might get tired of this life.
674
You might begin
to miss your family.
675
If it were our daughter,
we'd look for her too.
676
She would miss us.
677
Jen...
678
I want you to be mine forever.
679
I will make my mark
on the world.
680
I will earn your parents' respect.
681
We have a legend.
682
Anyone who dares to jump
from the mountain...
683
God will grant his wish.
684
Long ago, a young man's parents
were ill, so he jumped.
685
He didn't die.
686
He wasn't even hurt.
687
He floated away,
far away, never to return.
688
He knew his wish had come true.
689
If you believe,
it will happen.
690
The elders say...
691
''A faithful heart
makes wishes come true.''
692
Keep it safe.
693
Return it to me
when we are together again.
694
I will.
695
If you don't,
I'll come after you.
696
And I won't let you off so easy.
697
Wherever I went
someone always recognized me.
698
I really tried.
699
Later, I heard you came
to Peking.
700
I was afraid
I'd never see you again.
701
So I came.
702
I can't let you marry.
703
Go.
704
Jen...
705
Don't ever come back.
706
So it's over?
707
Yes.
708
We heard noises.
709
It was just a cat.
710
You think Jade Fox will show up?
711
She's out there...
712
but I doubt she'll show herself.
713
We'll keep our eyes open.
714
Sooner or later...
715
she'll come for the girl.
716
Jen!
717
Come with me!
718
You're mine!
Come with me to the desert!
719
Jen!
720
Come with me to Xin Jiang!
721
Tell me.
722
Where is Jade Fox?
723
Come with me. Hurry!
724
You thought she'd give it all up
and go back West with you?
725
She's mine.
726
Either way...
727
you are no good to her dead.
With the Gou and Yu clans...
728
hunting you,
you'll soon be in their hands.
729
I don't care anymore.
730
If you truly loved her,
you wouldn't say that.
731
Don't you want to see her again?
732
All right.
733
I'll write you an introduction.
Take it to Wudan.
734
Wait there for news from me.
735
All right.
736
When wills this end?
737
They take it, they put it back,
they take it again.
738
My home is turning into
a warehouse.
739
Come in.
740
Speak!
741
Jen has run away!
742
Gou found
the wedding chamber empty.
743
Governor Yu requests
your assistance.
744
You know
the Giang Hu underworld.
745
He wants to find her,
and keep her from harm.
746
Sir Te, leave this to us.
Don't worry.
747
What can I serve you?
748
This cup is dirty.
749
Hello.
750
What's your name?
751
Long.
752
It's young Master Long.
753
My apologies!
754
I'm Iron Eagle Sung...
755
and this is my brother in arms...
756
Flying Cougar Li Yun.
757
What brings you to Huai An...
758
and where are you headed,
Master Long?
759
Anywhere there's action.
760
In that case, perhaps
we could be of assistance.
761
Don't bother.
762
You don't seem to understand.
763
So what if I don't?
764
We have ways of helping you
to understand.
765
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
766
He is my defeated foe!
767
Have some tea.
768
Shu Lien...
769
The things we touch
have no permanence.
770
My master would say...
771
there is nothing
we can hold on to in this world.
772
Only by letting go
can we truly possess what is real.
773
Not everything
is an illusion.
774
My hand...
775
wasn't that real?
776
Your hand, rough and callused
from practice...
777
All this time, I've never had
the courage to touch it.
778
Giang Hu is a world
of tigers and dragons...
779
full of corruption...
780
I tried sincerely to give it up...
781
but I have brought us
only trouble.
782
To repress one's feelings
only makes them stronger.
783
You're right,
but I don't know what to do.
784
I want to be with you...
785
just like this.
786
It gives me a sense of peace.
787
Please follow me.
788
- I want a clean room.
- We have plenty.
789
Your order?
790
Steamed whole cod,
bite-size meatballs...
791
a little starchy,
but keep the sauce light...
792
shark fin soup, mixed vegetables,
and some warm wine.
793
I have to order
from a bigger restaurant.
794
Hurry then.
795
That's him.
796
I am Iron Arm Mi.
797
I heard a true master has arrived.
I have come to seek a lesson.
798
You asked for it!
799
What kind of Iron Arm are you?
800
You have amazing technique!
801
I am Flying Saber.
802
Are you related
to Southern Crane?
803
Southern Duck? I don't eat
anything with two feet.
804
Who could remember
such long-winded names?
805
Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe...
806
and you don't know
his master Southern Crane?
807
Who are you?
808
I'm Shining Phoenix
Mountain Gou.
809
Gou?
810
I hate that name.
811
It makes me puke!
812
Too bad you're named Gou.
813
You'll be the first
to feel my sword today.
814
Hold it!
815
Don't you know Monk Jing?
816
A monk, in a place like this?
You need a lesson!
817
Who are you?
818
Who am I?
819
I am...
820
I am
the Invincible Sword Goddess.
821
Armed with the incredible...
822
Green Destiny.
823
Beyou Li or Southern Crane...
824
lower your head...
825
and ask for mercy.
826
I am the desert dragon.
827
I leave no trace.
828
Today I fly over Eu-Mei.
829
Tomorrow...
830
I'll kick over
Wudan Mountain!
831
We politely asked for
a friendly match...
832
but she showed no respect,
and attacked us.
833
Everyone came by
to teach her a lesson.
834
Her sword was just too powerful.
835
I've traveled everywhere...
836
but never
met anyone so uncivilized.
837
She kept accusing me of being
Gou Jun Pei's brother.
838
Who is this Gou, anyway?
839
Her husband.
840
We're close
to your headquarters.
841
Go home and check in.
842
What about you?
843
I'll look around
and catch up later.
844
Not a bad idea.
845
Tonight we'll get a good night's
sleep at headquarters.
846
Mistress, you're back.
847
It's you!
848
How is everything here?
849
Fine.
850
You've been gone a while.
851
Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.
852
- Your wife was due?
- Yeah, a baby girl.
853
Good!
854
I'll be happy if she's
half as strong as you.
855
Mrs. Wu...
856
You're back!
857
- How's the arm? Still sore?
- Much better.
858
You've been gone so long.
859
Li Mu Bai is coming
to stay the night.
860
I'll go and make up his room!
861
Sister Shu Lien...
862
Here you must be
in proper attire.
863
I'm just borrowing some
clean clothes. I'm not staying.
864
I'll give them to you.
865
I was just passing by
and wondered how you were.
866
You, sister...
867
Look at the trouble
you've caused.
868
Now you know what
Giang Hu life is really like.
869
If you think of me
as your sister...
870
let me give you
some sisterly advice.
871
You can run from marriage,
but not your parents.
872
They forced me to marry!
873
Go back to them first.
874
Then you can decide about Lo.
875
You know about Lo?
876
He really loves you.
877
Come back to Peking with me.
We'll find a solution.
878
Where is he now?
879
Li Mu Bai
has made arrangements.
880
He sent him
to Wudan Mountain.
881
You're working together
to set me up! I'm leaving!
882
How dare you accuse us!
883
I always knew
you had stolen the sword!
884
I've done nothing
but protect you and your family.
885
And you've repaid me
with nothing but contempt.
886
Li Mu Bai himself spared you,
and all you do is insult him.
887
We wanted some peace
and you've ruined it all!
888
You're no sister of mine!
889
What do I care?
890
You were never a real friend
anyway.
891
But I wonder...
892
how long could you last
as my enemy?
893
Put the sword down!
894
Jen!
895
Everyone out. Shut the doors.
896
Fine... the friendship is over.
897
Don't touch it!
898
That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
899
Come and get it if you can.
900
Without the Green Destiny,
you are nothing.
901
Don't be a sore loser.
902
Go ahead. Take your pick.
903
I'll wait.
904
Go ahead.
905
Give me the sword.
906
Take it!
907
Stop it!
908
You don't deserve
the Green Destiny.
909
Not another lecture!
910
On guard!
911
Let's end this here.
912
Only the sword will settle this.
913
I only let you go because
I wanted to see the real you.
914
What do you know
about a true heart?
915
What do you want?
916
What I've always wanted,
to teach you.
917
All right.
918
If you can take back the sword
in three moves...
919
I'll go with you.
920
Give it back!
921
- Kneel!
- Never!
922
Then you have no use
for the sword.
923
Sooner or later
they'd drag you back to Peking.
924
Your parents
will never accept you again.
925
But why go home?
926
We've gone this far,
we won't stop now.
927
You'll always be my Lady.
928
At last, we'll be our own masters.
929
We'll be happy.
That's the most important thing.
930
All we have left is each other,
right?
931
Lie down and rest.
932
She's crazy.
You should have killed her.
933
I didn't have the heart.
934
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
935
Is it me
or the sword you want?
936
You've been drugged.
937
Where is Jade Fox?
938
What happened?
939
Jade Fox drugged her.
940
How did you get here?
941
We followed Jade Fox.
942
And so you die.
943
And so shall you!
944
A poisoned needle!
945
You deserve to die...
946
but the life
I was hoping to take...
947
was Jen's.
948
Ten years I devoted to you.
949
But you deceived me!
950
You hid
the manual's true meaning.
951
I never improved...
952
but your progress was limitless!
953
You know what poison is?
954
An eight-year-old girl...
955
full of deceit.
That's poison!
956
Jen!
957
My only family...
958
my only enemy...
959
You can't die!
960
Tell us what poison you used!
961
You can't die!
962
Tell us the antidote!
963
You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
964
She used Purple Yin...
965
Purple Yin poison.
966
It goes straight to the heart.
967
It's the same poison she used
to kill my master.
968
My blood
will soon reverse its flow.
969
There is no antidote.
970
That can't be!
Everything has an antithesis!
971
Why not this?
972
The antidote exists.
973
She taught it to me.
974
The formula is simple...
975
but it takes time to prepare.
976
Trust me.
977
As you have helped me...
978
let me help him.
979
All right.
980
Hurry.
I will hold on as long as I can.
981
Take my horse
and go to the compound.
982
Give this to Mrs. Wu.
She'll help you. Hurry!
983
Spare your energy.
I'll be back!
984
Where is Mrs. Wu?
985
Stop it!
986
Shu Lien
told me to show you this.
987
Let her in.
988
Mu Bai, hold on.
989
Give me some hope.
990
Shu Lien...
991
Save your strength.
992
My life is departing.
993
I've only one breath left.
994
Use it to meditate.
995
Free yourself from this world...
996
as you have been taught.
997
Let your soul rise to eternity...
998
with your last breath.
999
Do not waste it...
1000
for me.
1001
I've already wasted
my whole life.
1002
I want to tell you
with my last breath...
1003
I have always loved you.
1004
I would rather be a ghost,
drifting by your side...
1005
as a condemned soul...
1006
than enter heaven without you.
1007
Because of your love...
1008
I will never be a lonely spirit.
1009
He's gone?
1010
Bo...
1011
please take this sword
back to Sir Te.
1012
Now you must go
to Wudan Mountain.
1013
Lo awaits you there.
1014
Promise me one thing.
1015
Whatever path
you take in this life...
1016
be true to yourself.
1017
Do you remember the legend
of the young man?
1018
''A faithful heart
makes wishes come true.''
1019
Make a wish, Lo.
1020
To be back in the desert,
together again.
