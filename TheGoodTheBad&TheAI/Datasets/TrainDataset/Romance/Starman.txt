Dont do this to yourself, Jenny.
Go to sleep.
Thats very good.
- Mr. Director.
- Yes.
Would you excuse me, please?
- Sounds like Soviet space garbage.
- The MOLINK people say no.
- What does the Kremlin say?
- t know nothing.
Interceptor Delta Yankee reports a hit, sir.
No change in speed,
but another alteration of course.
New estimated point of impact:
North Wisconsin by Chequamegon Bay.
Get Mark Shermin.
Call me back in 20 minutes, will you?
Yes, sir.
Sorry about that.
What?
Chequamegon Bay? Yes, sir.
No problem.
Scott?
Youre not Scott.
Scott.
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven
As the Secretary General
of the United Nations...
an organisation of 147 member states...
who represent almost all
of the human inhabitants of planet Earth...
Boy, what a weird dream.
Who are you? What do you want?
We go.
I cant get the engine started.
Where?
Which way? Left, right?
Here.
You know where that place is?
If this is California and down here is...
...Texas, that must be, like...
...Arizona, maybe.
- Want to be driven.
Arizona maybe.
Ten minutes.
About that time, Mr. Shermin.
- Okay.
- Coffee?
Yeah.
Sergeant, can you get police bands
on that thing?
No problem. Why?
Is weird.
You know, freaky, bizarre.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
- Im Major Bell.
- Mark Shermin. Is it clean?
Well, no radioactivity.
No readings on bacteria.
You attached to National Security?
Not very. I just work for them.
On loan. Sort of like a library book.
No, actually Im with SETI.
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
So theyre sending you guys out
on meteorites now?
- Only when they change course.
- Change course?
- Can they do that?
- This one did.
So they tell me. Twice.
Either that or some airhead over at NORAD
misread a glitch on his monitor.
It also came down slower
than suborbital speed.
Naturally, they decided to fire
some missiles at it.
- What the hell are they doing?
- Taking a core sample.
- Nobody authorised that.
- Damn thing sounded hollow to me.
Theres no such thing as a hollow...
Jesus Christ!
You were about to say?
Thatt it?
You really are some kind of Martian
or something, arent you?
What do you want here?
What are you doing?
What do you want with me?
Where are you taking me?
Why do you look so much like Scott?
t get no
That does it.
Help!
You crazy sons of bitches.
Whats the matter with you?
Help!
Help me!
Help me, please.
Im being kidnapped.
I send greetings.
Whats going on here?
Im being kidnapped.
Greetings.
Youd better let her go.
Ill give you greetings.
Howd you do that?
Those little grey jobs?
Communications Central,
this is Project Visitor...
...at the Chequamegon sighting.
I have Mr. Shermin for you.
The directors on the line.
All right, what is it?
Ill know more in two hours.
Were taking it out now
and setting up a lab in Madison.
This meteor, the Chequamegon sighting,
appears to be hollow?
No, not  It is hollow.
I think the balloon has just gone up, sir.
Do you have to keep that thing
on your lap like that?
Those things
Guns make me a little bit jumpy.
Define
Thats a little bit.
Jumpys like nervous, afraid.
You know that word ?
Yes.
How much English do you understand?
I understand greetings
in 54 planet Earth languages.
I understand English language little bit.
Nothing much in there.
Its just a lot of junk.
Thats my wallet.
Thats license.
Thats me. My name, Jenny Hayden.
What do you want, anyway?
Why did you come here?
Oh, my God.
I look like Scott.
Yeah, you do.
I look like Scott...
...so you do not be little bit jumpy.
Listen, about those police calls,
you did say anything weird, right?
- You got something?
- Just picked up one from Ashland.
Happened sometime this morning.
A guy name Heinmuller had a collision
with an orange and black 77 Mustang.
The gal driving claimed
she was being kidnapped.
But when Heinmuller went to help her,
the kidnapper...
...yelled,
and melted his lug wrench.
Yelled,
and melted his lug wrench?
Weird you want, weird you get.
How do you melt a lug wrench?
I just copy them down,
I dont explain them.
- Did anybody get a license number?
- Wisconsin plates, Papa X-ray Victor 2-3-7.
Were checking the owner
through DMV now.
What the hell is that thing?
Well, its sort of an invitation, Major.
Remember that package
we sent up with the  probe?
There was a gold anodised disk...
...with greetings from Earth
in 54 different languages.
Complete with a nice little speech
from Kurt Waldheim:
To whom it may concern.
Come and see us sometime
Were coming to a gas station.
- Were gonna need some gas. Okay?
- ?
Gas.
For the car. Fuel.
Energy.
I step on the gas, the car goes,
I take my foot off, it stops. Understand?
No. I do not understand.
How can car need energy so soon?
I dont know.
Im just telling you, this is the gas gauge.
When the needle gets to E, that
No gas. The car stops. Period.
Okay.
Get gas.
- Here you go.
- Take it easy.
Yeah. Take it easy.
Hi.
- Fill her up, unleaded.
- Gas.
Gotcha.
Yeah, I know.
I have to go to the bathroom.
The ladies room. The restroom.
It
The hell with it,
you figure it out for yourself, Im going.
Me.
You.
Understand?
Cant get her out?
Gas.
Yeah, well, I know just how she feels.
Every goddamn place you go.
Take it easy.
Up yours.
Take it easy.
Up yours.
Hi, lets go.
Nothing of interest in here.
You wanna sign that for me, Ms. Hayden?
Kidnapped.
What?
What is...
?
You want to know what kidnapped is?
Its being dragged out of your house
in the middle of the night...
...by some whatever you are.
Being forced to drive all night at gunpoint
and not knowing where youre going...
...or whats going to happen to you
when you get there.
So if youre going to shoot me, go ahead.
Because Id rather be shot
than go on being scared to death.
Go ahead.
I mean you no harm, Jenny Hayden.
Start spreading the news
m leaving today
I want to be a part of it
Im sorry.
I did awaken you.
Do they sing a lot where you live?
Yes. We sing.
Do you ever get hungry?
Empty here?
Like a car needs gas?
Yes.
This body has a terrible emptiness.
This is called ?
Yeah, and when people get hungry
they have to eat food.
Eat. Yes, we must do that.
We will stop at food station.
You have hungry too?
Im starving.
I haven
Oh, my God.
Look out! What are you doing?
Okay?
Okay? Are you crazy?
You almost got us killed.
You said you watched me.
You said you knew the rules!
I do know the rules.
For your information,
that was a yellow light back there.
I watched you very carefully.
Red light: Stop. Green light: Go.
Yellow light: Go very fast.
- You better let me drive.
- I will drive.
Do you seriously expect me
to tell the President...
...that an alien has landed...
...assumed the identity of a dead
housepainter from Madison, Wisconsin...
...and is presently out
tooling around the countryside...
...in a hopped-up
orange and black 1977 Mustang?
We have the following givens:
That man, Scott Hayden, died last April.
Hes verified.
He has no brothers or lookalike cousins.
But still, this morning,
at approximately 6:00...
All right, we have been through all of that.
Im going to ask you now,
how could it happen?
We think it might be
some kind of a cloning deal...
...replication of an entire organism
from a single cell.
We found some hairs
from Scott Haydens head.
Is that possible?
I mean, can you clone a living organism
from the hair of a dead man?
Human hair consists of keratinised cells.
But in order to determine
whether replication is possible...
I asked you a question.
You mean us?
- In our present state of technology?
- Yes.
- No.
- What the hell are we talking about?
Were hypothesizing a technology...
...thats probably
Were the ancients, Mr. Fox.
?
Technologically, yes. Weve just started.
Even if youre right, I still have problems.
His knowledge of English.
Okay, listen to this.
I helped put this package together.
This was designed
so that an intelligent species...
...could get
a working knowledge of English.
Enough to get by, anyhow.
A couple-of-hundred-word vocabulary,
a rough idea of syntax.
Think of what it would mean to talk
to a being from a civilisation like that.
Think of what we could learn.
...w
s what he said
to Heinmuller on the road.
Its also what the cannibal said
to the missionary...
...just before he ate him.
Now the question in this case is:
Who is the missionary...
...and who are the cannibals?
When do you have to be there?
What?
In Arizona. When do you have to be there?
Do you see this little star?
Star? What star? Where?
There.
We call that the sun.
When this little
When the sun...
...appears mid-sky three more times,
I must be at Arizona.
You mean, 12:00 noon,
three days from now?
Yes.
What happens
if you dont get there in time?
Then they will go.
- Without you?
- Yes.
What will you do then?
Then I will die.
Die?
Understand?
You look for food station.
What?
A deer.
A dead deer.
why?
People hunt them to eat for food.
Do deer eat people?
No.
Do people eat people?
No, of course not.
What do you think we are?
I think you are a very primitive species.
What are you, softhearted?
Cry when you saw ?
Define
He doesnt understand.
Hes not from around here.
You dont speak any English?
Steer clear of that bozo.
Define
Jerk.
From Denver, here
Its south on Interstate 25.
Then you pick up l-40 westbound
at Albuquerque.
Will you forget the deer for a second?
Im trying to show you something.
Where exactly in Arizona
are you supposed to meet your friends?
West of Winslow.
I see a little speck on the map,
but there
Crater?
Is that where youre supposed
to meet them? Where the meteor hit?
Why do you do this?
Better safe than sorry.
Just in case something happens to me.
Theres one more thing.
The credit card, for the gas.
- You know how that worked?
- Why should something happen to you?
Who knows?
The way you drive, travelling with you
could be detrimental to the health.
Thats...
...me and Scott on our honeymoon.
A honeymoon is...
...what you call it when...
...two people first get married and they...
...go off together
after theyve fallen in love.
Define
Love is
Its when you care...
...more for someone else
than you do for yourself.
But it
Its when someone is a part of you.
And when they
What?
Scott is dead.
He was killed in an accident.
When someone you love...
...dies
Shit.
Define
Dons not a nice word.
Shit.
Dont mind him,
hes just learning to speak English.
Hes got a hell of a start on it.
Whos the devilled egg on white toast?
His.
Right. And a superburger.
Two orders of fries, two choc malts...
...and two Dutch apple pie
with whipped cream.
I had a wedge of it myself.
Its terrific. Enjoy.
Dig in.
Wait. No. Thats your dessert.
You eat that with a fork.
This thing. Here.
Like this.
No, but you eat that last.
Sandwich first, dessert last.
Why?
I dons done.
Whats the matter?
Dutch apple pie.
Good?
Its terrific.
For a primitive species we have our points.
Anybody for Lincoln, Omaha or Chicago,
the bus leaves in five minutes.
I
Ill be right back.
Excuse me,
is there a back way out of here?
Yeah, sure, through the kitchen. Why?
- You know that fellow I came in with?
- Yes.
Could you give these things to him
after the bus leaves?
Its just a map and some car keys
and a credit card.
- You sure, honey?
- Yeah, Im positive. Thanks.
Hey, honey.
I wouldnt go out
through the back door right now.
That friend of yours,
hes out there in the parking lot.
Thanks.
Excuse me, miss.
You strike me as a meat-eater.
I could fix you up
with a nice haunch of venison.
Maybe even a shot of pork if you could
Why, that son of a bitch.
No.
Hey, what happened to the goddamn deer?
He went there, to the woods.
Okay, comedian.
Bingo.
Stop it. You leave him alone!
- Butt out, girlie.
- He doesnt understand.
- Het speak English.
- So what?
Hey!
Here, youre losing your English, boy.
Pick up your garbage and get going.
Oh, Jesus. You okay?
I thought guns make you a little bit jumpy,
Jenny Hayden.
You make me a little bit jumpy.
I thought I told you to stay away
from those bozos.
Its okay. I think I understand.
It looks better that way.
Thank you, Jenny Hayden.
All part of our friendly service.
You okay, honey?
Im all right.
I wanted to tell you
that eastbound bus is about to go.
Want me to try to hold it?
No, thank you. Never mind.
Thanks, but never mind.
Good luck.
Im gonna get that bastard, Donnie Bob.
Right now.
Hey, look out!
Take it easy!
Up yours.
Im gonna get that son of a bitch.
Its their fault, the Mustang.
Son of a bitch hit me and just took off.
Anybody get his number?
No, but it wont be too hard to pick up.
That Mustang them State boys wanted
- Orange and black 77, Wisconsin plates?
- Yeah.
Well, kick her in the ass,
I think we got the bastard.
Weve been here since 6:30 p.m.
When can we leave?
As soon as the Federals say so,
and not one damn minute before.
Everybody tells it
pretty much the same way.
She had chances to get away from him,
but they left together with her driving.
Does that sound like any kind
of kidnapping you ever heard of?
Mr. Shermin!
They spotted an orange and black
Mustang, Wisconsin plates...
...going west near Big Springs.
Great.
Scott and I met two winters ago
up at Iron Mountain, ice-skating.
I had on this little tight skating outfit.
I was showing off. He kept staring at me.
One thing lead to another
and a few months later...
...we were on our honeymoon.
Honeymoon is nice?
Yeah, ours was beautiful.
Define
Beautiful is better than terrific...
...better than Dutch apple pie.
The best.
The best.
Gotta get a couple of hours sleep.
Just a couple, okay?
But what if they approach us?
Wait for the Feds.
They get the 6:00 news,
and we get the shit end of the stick.
Thats the way it is.
Yeah, well, it doesnt have to be that way.
I got a hunch, this might just develop
into a life-threatening situation.
Hi. Wed like a room for the night.
As far away from this as possible.
Boy, am I whipped.
My mom always said there wasnt a thing
wrong with the world that a hot bath...
...and a good nightt fix.
What am I doing?
I must be getting punchy.
Its just that in that light
you look so much like Scott.
- I wasnt thinking.
- You said the nose is different.
What?
You said, Your nose is different.
s something
else, something spooky about your eyes
Thats word for word.
You remember everything you hear
word for word?
Everything I hear, everything I see.
Everything
Everything this body feels.

Hey there, buddy. Are you in there?
Its
your Mustang in the parking lot...
...theres two cops trying to jigger the lock.
The bastards ran one on us!
Papa Charlie 3.
Suspects in Mustang heading south
on Big Springs bypass.
We are in pursuit.
Hes got a gun.
No!
Jenny Hayden?
Jenny Hayden?
It sounds impossible,
but I have people that say...
...they saw him carrying her out
of the burning wreckage.
Then they disappeared in the smoke.
Ive had the police check the entire area
and there are no bodies.
Oh, thanks.
I assume that theyre still alive
and theyre probably headed west.
Im going to Grand Junction, Colorado.
The Army is setting up some kind
of a roadblock on l-70. Im going.
Hey, Mark!
- Youre wanted on the horn. Urgent.
- Okay.
Hello? Ive probably been cut off. Hello?
Hello, I was talking to the police.
You wanted to talk about kidnapping?
Yeah, thatm calling.
You see, theres been a mistake.
There hasnt been a kidnapping.
Were worried about you, Mrs. Hayden.
I wanted to clear it up.
There hasnt been a kidnapping.
Where are you talking from?
I dont know. A truck stop somewhere.
- Miss?
- Hold on a second.
You looking for a fella?
About yea tall, red plaid shirt
and kind of nice looking?
Have you seen him?
He hitched a ride west with our night cook
about half an hour ago.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Look, Ive gotta go.
If you want,
call me in Madison in a few days.
- Wait, Mrs. Hayden.
Do you know who or what
you were kidnapped by?
He doesnt want to hurt anybody.
Really, cant you just leave him alone?
Hello? Damn it!
I need a ride west, fast.
Is go.
Whats your line?
- ?
- Work.
What do you do
when youre not hitching rides?
I make maps.
Make any money?
I make maps.
You dont get rich cooking, either,
believe me.
I got a girl, shes getting ready
to go to college this fall.
My wife had to go back nursing
to help me pay for it.
Here, you wanna smoke?
Yeah, my little baby.
Says she wants to be a doctor.
I dont know.
Costs an arm and a leg
to raise up kids these days.
?
Bread. Geetus. Money. And lots of it.
You all right?
Youre not from around here, are you?
What the John?
Some kind of roadblock, I guess.
Keep them in line.
Theyre slipping around the end.
Yes, sir. Sergeant, you heard the man.
Right away, sir. Get in line. Line up.
Move to the right and stay in line.
Stay in line. All you pedestrians, line up.
Line up. Move to the right and stay in line.
Oh, no.
You gotta help me, okay?
Stop him! After that car! After him!
Thank God! How did you get here?
I hitched a ride with a cook.
Its good to see you, Jenny Hayden.
We gotta get out of here. Come on.
Ive done something wrong, Jenny Hayden?
I wake up alone. Youre gone.
Not a word. Nothing.
You were right.
To be with me is not good for your health.
You could have at least told me
where you were going. Said goodbye.
?
Goodbye.
You don
Teach me this.
Well, I dons a custom.
Its...
...how you tell somebody
that youll miss them...
...that you wish them well.
That you hope

Can anyone have babies?
Just women.
I understand the reproductive process
as you know it.
As we know it?
You have a baby?
No.
No babies.
Why not?
Scott and I wanted to have a baby.
It just turned out I couldnt.
Im one of those lucky ladies that just...
...cant have one.
Here, a blanket! Its dry.
You better get out of those wet clothes.
Better get warm.
You know what pneumonia is? No?
Well, youre gonna find out
unless we get you dry in a hurry.
Here, put this on.
Hi there.
Mr. Fox has been delayed.
Hes going to be late.
Whats going on here?
According to our estimates, that object
was headed for someplace in Arizona.
Intelligence thinks the visitor is on his way
to make a rendezvous.
Go on inside. Make yourself at home.
Welcome to planet Earth.
Where are we?
I think we are coming to Winslow soon.
Why didnt you wake me?
I like to watch you sleep.
I dont know why.
Its strange.
I think I am becoming
a planet Earth person.
Do you have to go back?
Isnt there some way you could stay?
No. I must go back.
But there is something I must tell you.
I gave you a baby tonight.
No.
Thatt have a child.
Ive been to a doctor, a couple of them.
Believe what I tell you.
A boy baby.
He will be human,
a baby of your husband, but...
...also he will be my baby.
He will know everything I know and when
he grows to manhood he will be a teacher.
If you do not want this baby...
...tell me now, I will stop it.
Which is your star?
Can you see it from here?
Why?
I want to show him
where his father came from.
There.
No.
Wait
There...
...low in the sky.
There.
I see it.
Youd better get dressed.
We are coming to Winslow.
I hope to God were on the right train.
I dont know,
that looks awful big for Winslow, Arizona.
No.
Las Vegas!
What?
I think weve gone
about 300 miles past Winslow.
Were still going to be okay.
All we gotta do is rent a car,
and with a little luck...
...well be back there
before noon tomorrow.
Just try not to be too conspicuous, okay?
Come on.
$500,000, folks!
Whos gonna take it home?
Hit the giant jackpot
and your troubles are over!
$500,000, folks.
Define
A giant jackpot is a lot of money.
Money? Geetus, bread, an arm and a leg?
Where did you get that?
We dont have time
to fool with the slot machines.
We gotta find a rent-a-car place and
Wheres my wallet?
- My wallet.
- What is wrong?
Where the hell is my wallet?
What are we gonna do now?
Is all right.
But you dont understand.
No credit card, no money, no car.
- Were never going to get there on time.
- Is all right.
Now.
Damn!
Thats a handy talent you got there
but you better spread it around.
These guys get kind of curious
if you hit too many jackpots at once.
Choppers from the Air Cav
will search the area on a quarter-mile grid.
- Good, Ire here.
- What is this about?
Youre a man
of some scientific attainment.
Dont you recognise an emergency
autopsy room when you see one?
With leather tie-straps?
You behave yourself, Mark.
Is this your latest update?
According to NORAD...
...his original course and rate of descent
would have taken him here...
...south of Winslow.
I see. Anything else?
The Cobra guys
were asking about ammunition.
Helicopter attack units
will carry live ammo at all times.
- This is to be considered a combat mission.
- Right.
Listen, Mr. Fox,
Id like to be a team player...
...but I want to call something
to your attention.
If theret need,
its a lecture on morality.
All right, okay, screw morality.
What happened to good manners?
We invited him here.
- I have no time for this.
- Im trying to make a point.
So am I, damn it.
You make a great show of being a rebel,
but the fact is this:
You are a GS-11 public servant.
Anytime that becomes
too much of a burden...
...you can go back to Cornell,
or wherever it was that we found you.
And lets see you get by
on an instructors salary.
Now shape up or get out.
Is that clear?
Mr. Fox, theres been
a possible sighting in Las Vegas.
- Theyre probably headed in this direction.
- Lets set up a command post in Winslow.
Youd better get out there...
...providing you still want to be
a member of the team.
You do, dont you?
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then get going.
Get rid of that damn cigar.
We ought to be coming to the crater
anytime now.
Youre gonna make it.
Youre gonna go home.
You want to, dont you?
Yes, of course.
Whats it like up there?
It is beautiful.
Not like this, but it is beautiful.
There is only one language.
One law. One people.
And there is no war, no hunger...
...and the strong
do not victimise the helpless.
We are very civilised,
but we have lost something, I think.
You are all so much alive. All so different.
I will miss the cooks
and the singing and the dancing.
And the eating.
And the other things.
Morning, folks. Whatll you have?
Coffee.
Dutch apple pie?
- How about some nice cherry cobbler?
- Thatll be fine.
And whipped cream.
Coming right up.
How long does it take to get to the crater?
Driving? Not long. Five, six minutes is all.
I want you to try this cherry cobbler.
And if you dont like it,
you dont have to pay for it.
Its delicious.
My wife made it.
Is very good.
Do you have somebody?
A wife, like...
...up there?
No.
No?
I wish
I wish
What?
Morning, folks.
Is that your Cadillac outside?
All right, go ahead.
Yeah, hold it. Yeah, okay.
Id like to talk to these people alone.
Ill be right outside if you need me.
George Fox just called in on the radio,
said to say theyre on their way over.
Im Mark Shermin, SETI,
the Search for Extraterrestrial
Mrs. Hayden, we talked on the phone.
This is just such a
Do you mind if I sit down?
Thered like to ask,
I hardly even know where to begin.
Is there anything I can do for you?
You can let him go.
I cant.
Really, I canm sorry.
Is it
Are you supposed to meet someone here?
Yes.
You dont understand,
there isnt much time.
Why here? Why the crater?
Have people from your world
been here before?
Before, yes.
We are interested in your species.
You mean youre some kind
of an anthropologist?
Is that what youre doing here?
Just checking us out?
You are a strange species...
...not like any other.
And you would be surprised
how many there are.
Intelligent but savage.
Shall I tell you
what I find beautiful about you?
You are at your very best
when things are worst.
Let him go, Mr. Shermin, please.
If he stays here...
...hell die.
Cans dying now?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Wrong ones?
They sure as hell fit the description.
No. The guy were looking for
is a lot older.
Where are they?
What have you done with them?
- Trooper, where are your prisoners?
- Wrong ones. We had to let them go.
You what?
Shermin, you are finished.
I will have you eviscerated for this.
Well, as much as I hate
to stoop to symbolism.
I hear something.
Give me your hand.
All units, this is Fox.
I want warning fire only.
When ready, roger that.
I copy. Here we go.
What the hell is that?
I must go.
Take me with you.
- I cannot.
- Please.
You will die there.
I dont think I care.
I care.
Now...
...tell me again how to say goodbye.
Kiss me...
...and tell me you love me.
I love you.
Im never going to see you again, am I?
No.
I love you.
Tell the baby about me.
I will.
What should I do with this?
The baby will know.
Goodbye, Jenny Hayden.
Goodbye.
