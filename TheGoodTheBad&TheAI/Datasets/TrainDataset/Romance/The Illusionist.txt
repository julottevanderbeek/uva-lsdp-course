It's her! I know it's her!
She wants to tell us something!
- Hey!
In the name of His Imperial Majesty
and the city of Vienna...
- I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovicz...
Also known as Eisenheim
the Illusionist...
-
-  Leave him alone!
-
They're arresting him!
They're arresting Eisenheim!
Chief Inspector Uhl.
- You're late.
- My apologies, Your Highness.
I was attending to
the loose ends of the case.
- Are there still loose ends?
- Very few.
Did he do it again?
How does he do it?
Did you ask him?
He's not talking at this point.
Well, I'm sure
you have... methods...
I want you to put an end to it.
Surely you have something on him.
Yes. Yes, I think I do.
- Drop it!
- Come on.
Now, watch.
Remember who you are.
- Quick, come on.
-
They'll never find us.
Do you promise
you'll take me with you?
One day I will.
One day we'll run away together.
We'll disappear.
There's a secret way to open it.
I wanted a picture.
Sophie, are you there?
- We must hurry! They're coming!
Stop. Stop.
- Don't do this.
- Let go!
- Let me go. Let go!
- Your father's waiting for you.
- No!
- Eduard!
- Please, let go!
- No!
- Let me go!
Let her go, please!
- Sophie!
Eduard!
- Eduard!
Sophie.
space and time...
fate and chance.
These are the forces
of the universe.
Tonight, ladies and gentleman...
I present to you a man who has
unlocked these mysteries.
From the furthest corners
of the world...
where the dark arts
still hold sway...
he returns to us to demonstrate...
how nature's laws may be bent.
I give you... Eisenheim.
-
-
Might I borrow a handkerchief
from someone?
You, madam.
Thank you.
Ah, be patient.
Now, if you please.
From the moment we enter this life,
we are in the flow of it.
We measure it and we mark it,
but we cannot defy it.
We cannot even speed it up
or slow it down.
Or can we?
Have we not each
experienced the sensation...
that a beautiful moment
seemed to pass too quickly...
and wished that
we could make it linger?
Or felt time slow on a dull day...
I assure you, they're quite real.
Is it real? Let's see.
And you, madam,
where is your handkerchief?
Bravo!
Very good.
- Please, give us something. Please.
- What's all this?
We're poor.
- Do you think you're poor?
- Yes.
I want to show you something.
You're not poor.
You have everything
that you need right here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And that's yours.
- And this too.
-
I've got the magic one!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Coffee?
- No.
- Strudel? I have two.
- Nothing, thank you.
You look very pleased with yourself.
How are the receipts?
- Not bad. A three-quarter house.
But we're going to do better
than that. Listen to this.
Listen. "There is no argument
that his uncanny displays...
"separate him from the ranks
of garden-variety stage wizards.
"Some of his effects
transcend mere illusion...
"and approach the realm of art.
He is very young
to be so masterful.' '
We are going to make more money
than you ever dreamed of.
Oh, I know, of course
I thought of that.
It's the butterflies
I'm trying to work out.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Invisible wire.
Too obvious. How many men
have you detailed for tonight?
We have eight men inside,
another eight out front.
Mmm.
- Check the last 10 rows there.
- You! Don't touch that!
- Put that down!
- Ah, Herr Eisenheim.
Who are you and what do you
think you're doing?
I'm Chief Inspector Walter Uhl
and I'm inspecting your theater.
I've seen you perform.
Very impressive.
- How can we help you, Inspector?
You will be honored to know
the crown prince...
plans to attend
your performance tonight.
- The crown prince?
I think that one's small
for an assassin, don't you?
Yes, the orange tree.
You know, I have seen things
like this before...
but never one like that.
- Extraordinary.
- Thank you.
I have been puzzling
over how it works...
especially how the butterflies fly.
I assure you,
your secret is safe with me.
I'm an officer of the law after all,
and a bit of an amateur conjurer.
- Are you really?
- Yes.
Well, card tricks, coins,
uh, sleight of hand, yes.
Hmm.
But nothing fancy.
Perhaps you'll give me a tip.
Yes, all right.
I'll show you one I'm very fond of.
Are you a gambling man?
- On occasion, yes.
- I will bet you the secret of the orange tree...
that I can guess which hand
you place this in every time.
Excellent.
Put it in your fist, raise your hand
against your forehead...
- Yes.
- Yes.
It's in your left.
- Well...
- A lucky guess, perhaps.
You have a confederate
who signals you.
- No. It's more primitive than that.
- Uh-huh.
When you raise your hand to your head,
the blood drains from it.
It will be paler every time.
Oh. Oh, I like that very much.
Please take it with my compliments.
Why, thank you.
Eh, the blood drains.
- Now, Inspector...
-
If you don't mind, I've got to prepare
for tonight's performance.
Ah.
I thought we might end this evening
with a discussion of the soul.
All of the greatest religions...
speak of the soul's endurance
beyond the end of life.
So, what then
does it mean... to die?
Someone not afraid of death.
Please, someone?
I assure you,
no tragedy will befall you.
It's an honor, Duchess von Teschen.
Do you know me?
No.
You're quite certain
that we've never met before?
Yes, of course.
Now please gaze
directly into my eyes.
Look nowhere else.
Wave to yourself.
Turn in a circle.
Now bow to yourself.
-
Away.
They must have liked you. They've
waited for you nearly five minutes.
Your Highness, may I introduce
Eisenheim the Illusionist?
- Well done.
- Thank you for coming. I hope you enjoyed it.
Oh, we more than enjoyed it.
Stimulated great debate
amongst us, hasn't it?
Except of course for your assistant,
Duchess von Teschen.
You seemed to have struck her
quite speechless. A feat in itself.
- Did you hypnotize her?
- In a fashion.
- I'd like to learn that trick.
Do you claim supernatural powers?
I've never said anything
of that kind.
- Then you won't mind a question or two.
- Now let's not ruin it.
As you wish.
Your assistants
are behind the mirror...
somewhere in robes obviously.
Lights in the frame perhaps
to illuminate them, or angled mirrors?
That would be one way to do it.
I think I understand it all
except the ghost.
That was very, very good.
Another viewing perhaps?
You must come to the Hofburg next time.
We'll make an evening of it.
That will be my pleasure.
Sophie?
You'll really have a challenge then.
Then I'll prepare something special.
Perhaps I'll make you disappear.
My God.
When he volunteered her...
I heard the crashing sound
of money falling on me in piles.
Every lady of means in Vienna will
want to get up there with you now.
- Mmm.
- What a show-off.
His father would have died
if he had seen such a display.
- She didn't seem too happy about it either.
- She'd better get used to it.
- How's that?
- Word is she'll marry him soon.
- Really?
- Taking her chances if you ask me.
- Why?
- He likes to give his lady friends...
a good thrashing now and again.
People say he pushed one of them
off a balcony...
just to cover
the beating he'd given her.
For Herr Eisenheim.
Hello, Sophie.
It took me a moment...
but, yes, I knew.
You could have said something.
I thought you'd figure
it out eventually.
Yes, I would have.
I would have come another night,
volunteered...
walked right on stage
and said, "Hello.' '
I suspect you would have.
I don't understand why.
Perhaps for the same reasons you
find it prudent to meet in a carriage.
It's just a game
I have to play with them.
I'm followed everwyhere. It's...
It's supposed to be for my protection.
Yes.
So, I hear congratulations
are in order.
They say you'll be the princess.
- It's not decided at all.
- Ah.
It makes a certain sense, I suppose.
We've known each other for years,
and of course, our families.
He's very intelligent.
You're lucky, you know...
to have broken free as you did.
I often wish that I had...
Wished what?
Wished that I would see you again.
And now you have.
Yes, now I have.
I look forward to seeing you
again at the Hofburg.
Until then.
Here's the report
on Duchess von Teschen.
Mmm. Anything interesting?
See for yourself.
The magician?
Join us for a drink?
Please.
You like something to eat,
something to drink, hmm?
- No, thank you.
- Herr Eisenheim...
I'm going to ask you a question...
that may not seem friendly...
but I assure you, in fact, is.
What is your relationship
with the Duchess von Teschen?
You're right,
that doesn't seem friendly.
Oh, but that is precisely my point.
For, you see,
where others might judge...
a discreet carriage ride
for what it seemed to be...
I am willing to find out
what it actually was.
All right. We were
childhood acquaintances.
Acquaintances?
Childhood friends.
My father was a cabinetmaker.
-
I see, the cabinetmaker's son
friends with a...
- Has there been a complaint?
- Oh, no, no. If there'd been a complaint...
well, we'd be having a very, uh,
different sort of conversation.
Yes. He relies on you for
that sort of thing, does he?
I'm a simple public servant,
Herr Eisenheim.
That's not what I hear.
I hear you'll be
the chief of police very soon.
- Maybe mayor of Vienna? Party secretary?
- All subject to his whim.
You better hope he doesn't dissolve
the parliament before you get there.
Now the prince has some progressive ideas,
but he will make a fine emperor.
Well, they say you're very close to him,
so I'm sure you'll do fine.
Look. Yes, indeed, they say
that I'm very close to the prince.
But the simple truth of the matter is,
Herr Eisenheim, I'm the son of a butcher.
He's the heir to the empire.
How close could we be to such as him?
Don't fool yourself that
you can play in their game.
I've served on the edge of it...
for... many, many years...
and I can tell you with certainty...
It's not worth it.
is not a showman at all,
but rather a wizard...
Or so at least some of our friends here
would have us believe.
-
Everything can
and will be explained.
- All mysteries penetrated.
I didn't think he was invited.
A fair likeness of the old man.
- Too modern a style for him, of course.
I'm afraid I'm not much
of a painter.
It's true. There are no brushstrokes
in this painting.
I can see that clearly.
So to achieve the color...
some sort of chemical must
be interacting, presumably.
- May I?
- If you feel you must.
- I do.
- Oh, let the man do his show.
You want me to just sit there
when it's so obvious?
-
- I do.
He tries to trick you.
I try to enlighten you.
Which is the more noble pursuit?
May we have the lights, please...
so His Highness can better see?
-  See here, Leopold, let's have the show.
-  Hear! Hear!
- Come on, Leopold.
- Get on with it.
Very well. I propose a challenge.
if you can...
without all the... gadgetry?
As you wish.
Might I see it?
Certainly.
May I?
Where does power flow from?
Skill or destiny, or divine right?
We all know the story
of a sword called Excalibur.
Excalibur's blade
was fixed in stone...
and there it stayed.
Many worthy knights tried to
pull the sword from the stone.
Only Arthur succeeded...
proving his right to rule.
You, sir, can you take the sword?
No surprise there.
- Perhaps you, sir.
- Not so eager, cousin.
You shall live a long life.
Thank you for your indulgence.
Come now. If you can't pull it out,
you'll never be emperor.
The sword to its rightful owner!
That's enough light entertainment
for this evening.
For more serious discussion,
please join me for a drink.
Shut him down.
Well, he's very popular,
Your Highness.
I'm sure you'll find a way.
- What did you do to him?
- I gave him what he asked for.
What would possess you
to do something so foolish?
We don't want to keep
the prince waiting.
- Did you enjoy the show?
- It was wonderful, wasn't it?
It was amusing.
Who told you where to find me?
Your manager. I told him if he wants
to stay in Vienna, you need my help.
Ah, so I'm to be driven
from the city, is that it?
- Good. I shall relish it.
- Stop it!
Why? Why should you possibly
care what happens to me now?
You were my friend.
I  your friend.
We knew each other very briefly
a long time ago. You don't know me at all.
Then why did you speak to me?
Why did you even bother talking...
And you kept it all this time.
I used to sit and stare
at your picture...
trying to imagine where you were.
At night I'd have dreams
I had gone with you...
and then I'd wake up
and realize where I was.
But in my dreams you
had shorter hair and no beard.
Where did you go when you left?
To my uncle's farm near Prague.
How exotic.
I went to Russia...
then Asia Minor...
and then the Orient for many years.
So long.
I always meant to return.
I just... I kept thinking I'd find it
around the next corner.
What?
A real mystery.
I saw remarkable things...
but the only mystery
I never solved was...
why my heart couldn't let go of you.
He wants me to go to Budapest...
with him next week
to announce our engagement.
He wants the Hungarians behind him.
They're going to crown him king.
I'm sure his father will have
something to say about that.
He plans to overthrow his father.
That could go very badly for him...
and for you.
I am part of his plan.
He only gets Hungary by
aligning himself with my family.
- Leave him.
- It's not that easy.
Call it off and come away with me.
As long as we're alive...
he'll hunt us.
And when he finds us, he'll kill us.
Look at me.
Yes, I do.
There you are. As I predicted,
they've shut us down.
No, look. You got it off your chest.
- What?
- Do we have any money saved?
- Yes, we have some.
But we could have had
much, much more.
Mmm, it will have to do.
And the second account, all of it.
Thank you.
And you have no doubt
it was Duchess von Teschen?
I'd stake my life on it.
What was in this suitcase?
I don't know.
He's by the first car.
As you know, we sometimes follow...
Duchess von Teschen
for her protection.
Yesterday she was seen
in the company of another man.
What man?
Eisenheim the Illusionist.
What were they doing?
- Well, they were meeting and, uh...
Fornicating?
Not that we observed, no.
However, I have reason to believe that
they may be planning something together.
I'm not certain of anything yet,
Your Highness.
Thank you, Inspector.
- We can, of course, acquire more information...
He spent the afternoon
in Vienna with his father.
He's expected shortly.
What a surprise.
I suppose you think
you're very clever...
and very democratic
in your friendships.
- What are you talking about?
Your magician friend.
I know you've been with him.
It's true. We've been
friends since childhood.
You sleep with all
your childhood friends?
I will not be spoken to this way.
- You'll be spoken to as I wish to speak to you!
- You're drunk.
You're getting quite old,
aren't you?
And you? Can you even bear children?
Are you any use at all?
- Are you trying to embarrass me?
- It has nothing to do with you.
It has everything to do with me!
You will not share my bed
if you've slept with him!
You don't understand.
I'm not going to share
your bed at all.
I'm not going to Budapest with you.
I don't want to be part
of what you're planning.
And I will not marry you.
Now, you will travel
to Budapest tomorrow.
I recommend that you are here early,
packed and ready to go.
Good-bye.
What do you mean, "Good-bye"?
Come back here.
Come back here!
No, leave that.
Leave all the lanterns.
Whoa. Whoa.
I thought you saw her
get on the train with him.
No, sir. We were waiting in Vienna
for them, but they left from Baden.
- We  she was with him.
-
- Who are you?
- I'm the family's doctor.
Are you the chief inspector?
Yes, I am. You understand
this is a police matter now?
- Of course I understand.
- Good, good.
- You have determined the cause of death?
There's a wound on her throat...
just above the left collarbone.
Perhaps from a knife or a sword.
May I take a look?
Inspector, l-I will
not stand for it.
The crown prince
will not stand for it.
This is not some circus sideshow.
My apologies, of course.
Thank you, Doctor.
Probably robbed.
Gypsies, maybe.
Saw all those diamonds,
couldn't say no.
Chief Inspector,
there's one thing you should know.
- In the folds of her dress...
I found this small gemstone.
Seen last Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Riding without an escort...
toward the Imperial Hunting Lodge.
Groomsman said
she arrived about 8:30.
What was she doing riding alone?
He did this.
You know he did.
- I know who did what?
- The crown prince!
He killed her. He's done it
before, and you know it.
No, I don't know that. In fact,
I'm sure he didn't. He's in Budapest.
- He killed her before he left!
- I'm afraid the facts don't support your theory.
- She was leaving him.
- For who? You?
- Yes!
- Don't be absurd, Herr Eisenheim.
He killed her because
he couldn't let her go.
- She knew his secret.
- What secret?
- Ask your inspector. He knows...
- Stop this right now!
Are you completely corrupt?
No, not completely. No.
Which is why I'll advise you not to accuse
anyone, especially His Imperial Highness.
Or you will end up in jail yourself.
- Where's the guard who let her out of the gate?
- Gone with the crown prince.
- Did any of the servants see her leave?
- All asleep.
Ah-ha.
What about him?
He, uh, he put her horse
in the first stall when she arrived.
Ah.
Was it this one?
We don't have jurisdiction
on Imperial property.
Thank you.
I know.
So what are you doing?
Investigating.
Listening to that magician, are you?
No, I think not.
- Chief Inspector.
-
What have you found out?
- She was last seen riding here, alone.
- Yes.
And based on your information,
I then threw her out.
- Did she commit suicide?
- No. It was surely murder.
- Do you have a suspect?
- We will soon, Your Highness.
It's perfect.
My name is Frankel.
- Where did you come from?
- I come from Brunn.
My father is a lens grinder there.
How have you come
to be here tonight?
- I don't know.
They don't seem
to think it's a trick.
Eisenheim has given us hard proof...
of the soul's immortality.
The spirit has been reaffirmed...
to a new, moral earnestness.
"It is a revolutionary movement,
and we will turn the empire...
into a spiritual republic.' '
-
- Do you think Eisenheim's behind all this?
Why must I be bothered
with a magician?
He is proving to be more
than a magician, Your Highness.
He is a charlatan.
He's a faker.
He pretends to have
supernatural powers...
Put him on trial for fraud.
- First, we have to show it is fraud.
- Then do it.
Find out how the trick is done,
and then arrest him.
This is just a rough demonstration,
Inspector.
But you can see how it could work.
Yes, I see.
Not bad, not bad.
We need a spy in Eisenheim's troupe.
- Those Orientals, they won't give us anything.
- Mm.
- I already tried.
- Yeah. Then try something else.
What has happened here?
One of those ghosts from
the theater down the street.
- Yes. Up there.
- Where?
- There.
- Right there. And it's a boy.
- Yes. Look, look.
- Sick!
- Where is this thing?
- Right there.
-  Over there.
- Uh-huh. Did you see it?
Mm!
First the orange tree, now this.
Do I have to share all my professional
secrets with the police?
Well, in this case, yes,
or I'll be forced to arrest you.
- On what charge?
- Oh, well, we'll start with fraud.
- Excuse me, Chief Inspector...
- What?
I think you should look
outside the window.
- Who are they?
- They are here for him.
My goodness, you have
a devoted following.
- What is it they expect of you?
- I have no idea.
What do your spies tell you?
That you plan to subvert
the monarchy, perhaps.
Why? Just because
the crown prince is a murderer?
He's not a murderer.
We have the real murderer in prison.
- He pleaded guilty.
- You've got the wrong man.
- You don't know that.
- No, but you do.
Hmm.
Herr Eisenheim, you will
also go to prison...
if you don't explain to me
what it is you are doing.
The sentence will be greater
if that mob attacks the building.
- Well?
-
-
- You must listen to me, please!
Thank you all for coming. I have been
speaking with the chief inspector.
I want you all to know...
that everything that you have seen
in my theater is an illusion.
I can't bring loved ones
back from the grave.
I can't receive messages
from the other side.
I apologize if I've given
you any false hope.
My intention has only been
to entertain, nothing more.
-
Please, you must go.
There, now. I've explained it,
so it can't be fraud.
May I go?
Has he tricked you?
Is that it?
Then why are you failing me?
I thought I could trust you.
I thought you were a man I could bring
with me when I took the throne.
- Am I wrong about you?
- No. You're not wrong, Your Highness, no.
I need men who can complete
the tasks assigned to them!
Instead, I'm surrounded by fools.
- I can see this case will be no different.
- Mm.
- How do I look?
- Ordinary, Your Highness.
Very ordinary.
I think I'm going to enjoy this.
- They don't recognize you.
- Good.
And keep your distance. I don't want
to be seen with a policeman.
- Yes.
-
- Someone. Here.
Chief Inspector, are you sure
you have the right man?
- Quite sure. Excuse me.
- Did you investigate the crown prince?
He cannot continue if this is true.
- He must be brought to justice.
- It's not true.
The magic trick is not evidence.
What is your name?
- I don't see how that matters.
- I advise you to watch what you say, sir.
That actress didn't even
look like Sophie.
But the audience is
stupid and he knows it.
He manipulates them.
He himself said nothing.
His actress said nothing
inflammatory.
He left it to the audience
to make their accusations.
All plants paid for
by him, of course.
I don't suppose you made
a note of those people?
I'm afraid we didn't
have enough men tonight.
Every one of them.
Eisenheim, the whole troupe.
I want to have an example
made of him...
in front of all his followers.
That was very foolish last night.
You can't destroy him, you know.
- You can't bring down the monarchy.
- Oh, I know  can't.
Then don't raise her again.
Don't provoke those questions.
Eisenheim, I don't
want to arrest you.
I'm a cynical man, God knows...
but if your manifestations
are somehow real...
then even I'm willing to admit,
you're a very special person.
And if it's a trick,
then it's equally impressive.
Either way, you have a gift.
So don't make me put you in jail!
Promise me you won't do it again.
I promise you, you'll
enjoy this next show.
What do you want?
- Nothing.
- Then why bring her back?
Just to be with her.
To be with her.
- Everything is ready?
- Yes, sir.
- We're trying to assess how he might escape.
- He will not escape.
- I want guards at every door and window!
- Sir.
But I want to make it up to you,
if you'll listen to a proposition.
- Well, I don't know.
- I'll make it worth your while, Josef.
You know, I'm very busy right now. I haven't
just been sitting around waiting for you.
No. No, of course.
I want you to assume control
of all my finances.
And my assets.
- Everything.
- Everything?
Yes. Including this theater...
and all the receipts from
tonight's performance...
which I offer with
my sincere thanks.
- What do you say?
- All right.
- I'll do it.
- Good. Good.
Would you like me
to introduce you tonight?
No. Tonight, just enjoy the show.
Excuse me, Chief Inspector.
I'm Josef Fischer, Eisenheim's manager.
Yes, I remember.
- What's going on? Why all the police?
- Precautions, Herr Fischer.
- Precautions.
- Are you planning to arrest Eisenheim?
Oh, that's entirely up to him.
Why were you murdered?
- I was leaving him.
- The crown prince?
- I tried to get away.
I was wearing my locket when I died.
- Was it the crown prince?
We must do something!
- Come along.
and the City of Vienna,
I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovicz...
also known as
Eisenheim the Illusionist...
charlatanism and
threats against the empire!
- No!
-
-  He disappeared.
-  Where is he?
Find him!
- Where is he?
- He was right there.
- How was his trick done?
- No trick.
- How is it done?
- I don't know. Nobody know.
And after that, I came in here...
and you asked me why I was late.
You've stolen Imperial property.
That seems trivial
compared with murder.
Even if that were true, you have
no jurisdiction here.
Nobody can punish you.
- Except one man.
- Who's that?
The emperor.
I don't suppose he'll leave his crown
to a murderer, do you?
- He'll never believe you.
- Maybe not.
Hmm.
But, I wrote a letter
to his general staff...
I know they'll listen to that.
You no longer want to be chief of police?
Mayor of Vienna?
I'm afraid that's out of
the question at this point.
You fool.
He's tricking you.
He's manipulating you. He had the sword
at a command performance.
He could have pried the stones loose then
and planted them here.
- He has planted everything.
- You're drunk.
It's all a trick.
It's an illusion.
Perhaps there's truth
in this illusion.
You need to wire your driver,
and have the sword returned.
- Or what?
- I'll shoot you. Perhaps I'll shoot you anyway.
And then you'll have killed
a police inspector and a duchess.
Or perhaps you'll kill yourself.
You, uh, committed suicide,
distraught at having failed your leader.
They must have received my letter.
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.
Fine. Fine. You shall have nothing.
- Gentlemen...
- The situation is so obvious.
Everyone's completely incompetent.
My father runs the empire
into the ground...
and no one notices, no one
knows anything about it.
I propose to clean up
the mess, and you betray me!
You're all becoming irrelevant.
You will be replaced.
The country will be run by mongrels!
There's a thousand different voices screaming
to be heard, and nothing will be done!
Nothing!
I've done everything I can.
Too much!
- Far too much.
-
- You're all fools.
-
- I can't stand it.
- I won't stand it.
-
- What happened?
- The crown prince just shot himself.
I used to be.
You!
Who gave you this?
- Herr Eisenheim!
When?
-
- All aboard!
Tickets and papers.
you'll travel ahead
with her, and I will follow.
- And she understands everything this entails?
-
