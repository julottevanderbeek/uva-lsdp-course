GIRL'S VOICE: IMAGINE YOURSELF
BEING SUCCESSFUL.
FIVE EXERCISES TO MAKE YOUR BUTT SMALLER.
THE POSSESSION OF WILLPOWER
AND SELF-DISCIPLINE
CAN BE THE FACTOR LEADING TO SUCCESS.
USELESS BITCH. 88 LBS.
YOU'RE DISGUSTING, DO YOU KNOW THAT?
FOCUS ON YOUR GOAL.
SENSITIVITY OR ALLERGY
CAN REDUCE--
GOD, I HATE POOR PEOPLE--
IN THE BODY.
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!
HAIR IS YOUR CROWNING GLORY.
IF YOU'VE GOT IT, THEN
STYLE IT-- FUCK YOU--
IN A WAY
THAT FLATTERS YOUR FACE
AND CHOOSE A GREAT COLOR
IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR OWN.
IF YOU WANT TO, TRY SOME
TEETH-WHITENING SOLUTIONS.
TEEN-DATING ABUSE AND VIOLENCE
IS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE.
TAKE RISKS.
FAT BITCH.
STEP OUT
OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.
SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE THINK BIG
AND ACT BIG--
REMEMBER THAT SUCCESS
DOES NOT GUARANTEE HAPPINESS.
ACCEPT LIFE IS UNFAIR.
ARE MY HIPS NORMAL?
ACCEPT LIFE IS UNFAIR.
FACT: EGGS CAN LIVE FOR UP TO TWO DAYS--
DON'T GIVE UP.
IF YOU DON'T GIVE UP, YOU CAN'T FAIL.
YOU CAN'T FAIL,
YOU CAN'T FAIL, YOU CAN'T FAIL.
DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK HOME?
YOUR ANIMALS
ARE ALL ALONE
AND THERE'S A CHICKEN
WAITING ON THE STOVE
AND YOUR COUSIN LEFT HIS DVD
OF "SWINGING IN THE '70S"
AND DO YOU WANNA
GO BACK HOME?
CHECK YOUR MESSAGES
AND CHARGE YOUR PHONE
OH, ARE YOU REALLY
SURE YOU WANNA GO?
WHEN YOU CAN
DO IT WITH A ROCK STAR?
DO IT WITH A ROCK STAR?
I DON'T WANT YOUR BODY
-  ALL THE PRACTICE IN THE WORLD...
-
WON'T GET ME GOOD
AT LONELINESS-LESS
LONELINESS-LESS-
LESS-LESS-LESS
DO YOU WANNA DANCE?
DO YOU WANNA FIGHT?
DO YOU WANNA GET DRUNK
AND STAY THE NIGHT?
DO YOU WANT TO SEE
ALL MY CAVITIES?
TALK ABOUT THE CRISIS
IN THE MIDDLE EAST?
DO YOU WANNA GET
REALLY TERRIFIED?
ICECAPS ARE ALL MELTING
AND WE'RE GONNA DIE
DO YOU WANNA CRY?
I CAN MAKE YOU CRY
DO YOU WANNA HIT ME, BABY,
ONE MORE TIME?
DO YOU WANNA?
DO YOU WANNA?
DO YOU WANNA?
DO YOU WANNA?
-  DO YOU? DO YOU? DO YOU? DO YOU?

AND HE'S AN ASSHOLE.
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,
MY NAME'S DAISY.

OKAY.
WELL, UM, WE SHOULD-- WE
SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO THE CAR.
YEAH SURE,
LET'S GO TO THE CAR.

P.A.: ...HIGH SECURITY.
PLEASE REMAIN VIGILANT.
REPORT ANY SUSPICIOUS
BEHAVIOR IMMEDIATELY
WHERE ARE YOU
TAKING ME?
OH, THEY CHARGE 15 QUID FOR
HALF AN HOUR'S PARK HERE.
SOD THAT.
JESUS.
IT'S JUST DOWN HERE.
OW!
HERE, I'LL PUT IT
IN THE CAR.
- WHAT AGE ARE YOU?
- 14.
YOU'VE GOT A LICENSE?
NO, BUT I'VE BEEN DRIVING
SINCE I WAS SIX.
YOU EXPECT ME TO GET
IN THIS THING?
- WITH YOU?
- WELL, YOU COULD GET A BUS IF YOU'D RATHER.
FINE YEAH, I WOULD.
- IT DOES TAKE ABOUT EIGHT HOURS THOUGH.
-
AND THE NEXT ONE'S
NOT DUE UNTIL 11:00...
-
- ...TOMORROW MORNING.
- ISAAC: WELCOME, BY THE WAY...
- UH-HUH.
- ...TO ENGLAND.
- DAISY: SHIT!
-
- CAREFUL!
-
- JESUS CHRIST.
SORRY. I'M BETTER WHEN
THERE'S NO CARS AROUND.
SO ARE YOU GONNA STAY
WITH US FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER?
WHAT, I JUST GOT HERE, YOU
WANT TO GET RID OF ME ALREADY?
NO NO NO, NOT AT ALL. WE'VE BEEN
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING YOU.
PIPER ESPECIALLY. SHE'S THE
ONLY GIRL MOST OF THE TIME
AND YOU'RE OUR ONLY COUSIN,
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE LIKE
A GUEST OF HONOR.
- ROAD!
-
YEAH WELL,
JUST SO YOU KNOW
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE
STUPID YANKS WHO'S GONNA
KISS YOUR ASS THE WHOLE TIME
BECAUSE YOU'RE BRITISH, OKAY?
- OKAY.
- OKAY.
HAVE WE BONDED NOW? CAN YOU
JUST SHUT UP AND DRIVE?
YEAH.
UM, WELL,
- YOU'RE THE BOSS.
-
- WHAT IS THIS?
-  I FORBID...
-
-  YOU MAIDENS ALL
THAT WEAR GOLD
IN YOUR HAIR
TO TRAVEL
TO CARTERHAUGH
FOR YOUNG TAM LIN
IS THERE
NONE THAT GO
BY CARTERHAUGH
BUT THEY LEAVE HIM
A PLEDGE
EITHER THEIR
MANTLES OF GREEN
OR ELSE
THEIR MAIDENHEAD
"OH, HAD I KNOWN,
TAM LIN," SHE SAID
"WHAT THIS NIGHT
I DID SEE
-  I'D HAVE LOOKED HIM IN THE EYES..."
-
"AND TURNED HIM
TO A TREE."
HERE WE ARE.
WELCOME HOME.
-
-
SHE'S HERE, MOM!
SHE'S HERE!
- GET YOUR DOG AWAY FROM ME.
- PUSH HER AWAY, DAISY. THEY'LL BE FINE.
- JET! GET DOWN!
- GO-- GET OFF OF ME!
-
-
- ISAAC: JET, GET OFF!
- GIRL: GET OFF, JET!
- JET, GET OFF!
-  ENOUGH!
- GIRL: GET OFF, JET! GET DOWN!
- DAISY: UGH, MOVE!
-
- COME HERE.
PIPER:
JET, BACK!

-
DAISY'S VOICE: ALLERGY TO WHEAT CAN
PRODUCE A VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS.
HOW TO BE--
FUCKING LOSER, FUCKING LOSER.
SORRY ABOUT THE DOGS.
THEY JUST-- THEY JUST GET OVEREXCITED.
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.
- WHO IS THAT?
- EDMOND.
- EDMOND?
- HE'S THE OLDEST.
AND THIS IS PIPER.
SHE'S OUR BABY.
I'M NOT A BABY!
ELIZABETH, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO SEE MY UNICORN?
- UM, PROBABLY NOT.
- PIPER, LEAVE HER ALONE.
- ELIZABETH, YOU'RE AMERICAN.
- IT'S DAISY.
NO ONE CALLS ME ELIZABETH.
AND IF YOU DON'T MIND,
WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE
TO SEE IS MY ROOM.
I NEED TO WASH MY HANDS,
LIKE, RIGHT NOW.
I'VE GOT SOME KIND
OF CANINE S.T.D.
I'LL TAKE THAT.
OH HEY.
THIS IS JOE.
- HI.
- HE'S OUR NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR.
WELL, SORT OF.
BUT HE LIVES WITH US AS MUCH AS HE CAN.
THAT WAS HIS DOG, GIN.
-
- NO, COME BACK.
- BLESS YOU.
- HEY, DO YOU WANT A DRINK?
- NO.
- AND YOU CAN WASH YOUR HANDS
IN THE SINK IF YOU WANT.
- PIPER: MOM! SHE'S HERE!
- ISAAC: PIPER, LEAVE HER.
- IT'S NOT TIME.
- IS YOUR MOM OUT OR...?
NO, SHE'S IN HER STUDY.
WE DON'T USUALLY SEE HER
BEFORE 9:00.
SHE'S AN EXPERT
IN LOONY EXTREMISTS.
- SHE'S GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD.
- PIPER, SHUT UP.
- TAKE COUSIN DAISY TO HER ROOM.
- COME ON, COUSIN DAISY.
I NEED TO GIVE YOU
THE GRAND TOUR OF THE HOUSE.
-
- THIS IS MY UNICORN I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.
-
- SHH, THAT'S MOMMY'S OFFICE.
-
- NOW WE WILL COME UP THE STAIRS.
THAT'S THE JUNK ROOM THAT
JOE SLEEPS IN SOMETIMES
WHEN HIS DAD'S BEING A WANKER.
I KNOW WHAT A WANKER IS, BY THE WAY.
AND IN HERE IS YOUR ROOM.
YOU'VE SO GOT THE BEST
BED IN THE HOUSE.
UH-HUH.
WELL, I THINK MY DAD'S
PROBABLY TRYING TO GET
THROUGH TO ME, SO...
I'D KIND OF LIKE
TO YELL AT HIM IN PRIVATE.
SO CAN YOU LEAVE?
NOW, PLEASE?
ALL RIGHT.
- CAN I GET YOU A CUP OF TEA?
- NO THANKS.
GLAMOROUS, CONFIDENT GIRL.
I HOPE YOU GET KILLED.
DUMB BABY, DUMB BABY.
ITCHING, RASHES,
WATERY EYES,
WATERY EYES,
WATERY EYES...
-
-
-
- ISAAC: WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO TODAY, MAN?
JOE:
DON'T REALLY MIND.
- I WANNA GO FISHING.
- MMM.
- GO AND GET SOME FISH, MAN.
- HEY.
COUSIN DAISY
AT LAST!
- WE THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER GET UP.
- MORNING.
SIT WHEREVER YOU LIKE. WE'VE MADE
ENOUGH FOR ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE.
MOM HAS AN EMERGENCY
MEETING IN LONDON.
SHE SAID SHE'S SORRY
AND SHE'LL SEE YOU THIS EVENING.
THERE'S GOING TO BE
A WORLD WAR III.
NO, THERE ISN'T.
STOP BEING A DICK
- AND GET DAISY SOMETHING TO EAT.
- I'M NOT A DICK!
- I'M ACTUALLY NOT THAT HUNGRY.
- DICK DICK DICK.
-
- ALL RIGHT, JET, I'M DOING IT.
WE LET YOU SLEEP IN. EDDIE SAID YOU
NEEDED TO CATCH UP ON SOME REST.
- DID HE?
- PIPER: ARE YOU A VAMPIRE?
NO.
- HOW MUCH DEAD ANIMAL DO YOU WANT?
- I'M REALLY NOT HUNGRY.
IF YOU WANT, I CAN
MAKE YOU A SANDWICH.
WE'VE GOT SOME
REALLY NICE CHEESE.
NO. I DON'T DO WHEAT
OR COW CHEESE.
- COW CHEESE?
- KNOB CHEESE.
WHY DON'T YOU EAT COW CHEESE?
BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY
SOLIDIFIED COW MUCUS.
IT STAYS IN YOUR GUT
FOR LIKE FIVE YEARS.
-
- EDDIE: MORNING.
OTHERS:
MORNING.
- DID YOU GET THROUGH TO YOUR DAD?
- YEAH.
HE'S FINE.
ACTUALLY, ISAAC, COULD YOU
PASS ME THE WATER, PLEASE?
DAISY'S VOICE: AT LEAST EIGHT
GLASSES OF WATER A DAY.
ISAAC: MOM SAID SHE'D CALL
HIM AS SOON AS SHE CAN.
- LET HIM KNOW YOU ARRIVED SAFELY AND ALL.
- NO, THAT'S FINE.
HE'S KIND OF BUSY WITH WORK
- AND THE NEW BABY, SO...
-
INCREASING THE SUPPLY
OF THE BRAIN HORMONE...
-
- HEY.
-
- HAVE YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
DAISY'S VOICE: IT SHOULD BE
TAKEN ONCE A DAY WITH WATER.
STAY AWAY
FROM DISTRACTIONS,
DISTRACTIONS,
DISTRACTIONS, DISTRACTIONS.
STEP OUT
OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.
- SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE THINK--
-
WHO IS IT?
UH, WE'RE GOING FISHING,
IF YOU WANNA COME.
I DON'T FISH.
UGH, GROSS!
YOU'VE GOT ME
IN A HEADLOCK, DARLING
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO BREATHE
YOU'VE TURNED ME
UPSIDE DOWN...
- ISAAC: COME ON, LET'S GO.
- PIPER: LET'S GO!
- ISAAC: COME ON, MOVE!
-
- YOU CAN'T HAVE THE FISH. NO, YOU CAN'T.
- PIPER: OFF!
YOU DON'T WANT THEM.
THEY'RE ALL SLIMY.
- COME ON.
-
- JOE: DIE! DIE!
- NO WAY, IT'S CEASEFIRE.
TERRORIST FORCES DON'T
RESPECT THE CEASEFIRE.
- YOU'RE DEAD.
- YOU DON'T WANT FISH.
- IT'S DISGUSTING.
- JOE: WAIT FOR ME.
PIPER:
NOT THERE! COME ON!
AUNT: FOR FUCK'S SAKE,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HAVE YOU GOT ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE IMPOSING?
YOU ARE GOING TO COMPLETELY
LOSE ANY CREDIBILITY.
-
- NO.
...THE WHOLE POINT IS
TO FOCUS ON THE CEASEFIRE.
WHAT'S THE POINT IN GOING
OVER IT ALL AGAIN
WHEN I'M GETTING ON A PLANE
AT 10:00 IN THE MORNING?
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS
IN-PERSON BEFORE THE BRIEFING.
THE REASON MY EMAIL
MENTIONED MY KIDS
IS 'CAUSE WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT MIGHT BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN
AND I'VE GOT TO GET ON A PLANE
AND LEAVE THEM HERE,
SO DON'T EXPECT ME TO BE FUCKING
CALM ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?
-
-
- EDMOND?
- NO.
ELIZABETH.
OH, PASCALE, PASCALE,
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
COME IN.
HEY.
LOOK AT YOU.
- I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN SO BLOODY USELESS.
-
IT'S THIS PEACE PROCESS.
IT'S A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE.
HELLO? AH, ANYA.
I HAVE SPOKEN TO PASCALE AND I'LL
CALL YOU BACK IN FIVE MINUTES.
ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
SIT.
YES.
ALWAYS PREPARE
FOR THE WORST.
IT'S THE BEST WAY
TO ENSURE IT NEVER HAPPENS.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.
SO...
HOW ARE YOU SETTLING IN?
YEAH, IT'S-- IT'S FINE.
- I HOPE MY CHILDREN ARE LOOKING AFTER YOU.
-
LET THEM WAIT.
AH, NOW I'VE GOT YOU HERE,
I JUST WANTED TO ASK:
I'VE GOT TO FLY TO GENEVA IN THE
MORNING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS
AND I CAN'T DECIDE WHETHER
OR NOT TO TELL YOUR FATHER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO WORRY UNNECESSARILY.
DON'T BOTHER.
IF MY DAD CARED ABOUT ME,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE, SO...
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- WHAT?
- SORRY. IT'S JUST...
JUST THE WAY
YOU SAID THAT JUST--
REALLY REMINDED ME
OF JULIA.
MMM.
SHE USED
TO LOVE IT HERE.
IT WAS HER FAVORITE PLACE.
MY MOM CAME HERE?
OF COURSE.
DIDN'T YOUR FATHER
TELL YOU THAT?
NO.
NO.
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THE ROOM YOU'RE STAYING IN,
THAT'S WHERE
SHE USED TO SLEEP.
SORRY.
YEAH. OH HI, SAM.
NO NO NO, IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.
I'M SITTING
IN FRONT OF IT.
-
- IF YOU TELL ME YOUR THOUGHTS,
I WILL GIVE YOU
A ROUGH ESTIMATE,
YEAH. UH, DAISY?
DAISY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING.
MY FRIEND SALLY'S GONNA COME UP AND LOOK
AFTER EVERYTHING WHILE I'M AWAY, OKAY?
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT!
YES.
-
-
PIPER:
COME BACK QUICKLY.
HEY, UM...
WE'RE GONNA GO SWIMMING
BEFORE SALLY GETS HERE
AND MAKES US EAT VEGETABLES.
I DON'T SWIM.
IT'S LIKE
A REALLY SPECIAL PLACE.
IT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE TO HAVE SOME
FUN BEFORE THE FASCIST REGIME.
UH-HUH.
MAYBE NEXT TIME.
OKAY.
STOP STOP.
STAY AWAY FROM DISTRACTIONS.
TAKE RISKS.
STEP OUT
OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.
PHYSICAL SHORTCOMINGS.
FIND THE GOAL OF YOUR LIFE.
-
- ISAAC: HEY.
HEY.
WHAT?
I CAN'T CHANGE MY MIND?
OH NO.
NOT HER!
N.B., JUST BECAUSE
I'M ATTENDING
DOESN'T MEAN
I'M PARTICIPATING.
THERE WILL BE
NO SWIMMING.
YEAH, WE'LL SEE.
- HEY, JET, COME ON.
- COME ON, JET.
- JET!
- COME ON, BABY.
COOL.
COME ON, LET'S GO.
- ISAAC: COME ON.
- PIPER: JET!

CAN'T CATCH ME!
HELLO.
GOOD DOG.
ISAAC:
COME ON, LET'S GO. HEY.
DON'T GO NEAR THEM.
COME ON, LET'S GO.
ARE THOSE COWS OR BULLS?
HEY, GUYS?
-
- THEY'RE COWS-- COWS!
PIPER:
COW-CHEESE COWS!
IT'S FINE.
YOU GO ON.
- THEY WON'T HURT YOU.
- I KNOW.
I'M-- I'M FINE.
I'M JUST GONNA GO HOME.
I DIDN'T REALLY WANNA
GO SWIMMING ANYWAY, SO.
WAIT HERE.
NO WAY.
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?
- OH OW! OW SHIT!
- YOU OKAY?
AW, FUCKING DIRTY FENCE.
- YOU'RE BLEEDING.
- IT'S COOL.
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
- LET ME SEE.
IT'S REALLY FINE.
WE'D BETTER CATCH UP.
- ISAAC: PIPER!
- PIPER: LOOK, I DID IT!
LOOK AT THIS!
COME ON!
OH, IT'S COLD!
IT'S COLD! IT'S COLD!
WHOO!
JET, OH, COME HERE.
- ISAAC: JOE, COME ON IN.
- PIPER: COME ON, JET.
- CATCH! CATCH, JET!
- JOE: IT'S FREEZING.
SERIOUSLY, MAN,
IT'S NOT THAT COLD.
-
- HEY! OH, CAREFUL!
-
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT KIND OF BACTERIA
- LIVES IN RIVER WATER?
- NOT THIS WATER.
COME ON, DAISY.
NO ONE EVER COMES HERE
AND DOESN'T GO SWIMMING.
YEAH WELL, THERE'S A FIRST
TIME FOR EVERYTHING.
-
- WHOA, SAVED YOUR LIFE.
- DAISY, COME AND LOOK AT THIS.
- WHAT?
JUST COME AND YOU'LL SEE.
QUICK.
YOU'RE GONNA MISS IT.
LOOK, CAN YOU SEE IT
RIGHT THERE?
- DAISY: NO.
- JOE: LOOK. JUST RIGHT THERE.
LOOK.
RIGHT HERE.
- RIGHT THERE. LOOK.
- ALL THESE RULES--
YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT
TO OBEY THEM.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- ALL THAT NOISE INSIDE YOUR HEAD.
DUMB BABY.
STOP IT.
IT'S IN YOUR HEAD.
-
-
YOU FUCK!
HE LOVES ME,
HE LOVES ME NOT.
HE LOVES ME,
HE LOVES ME NOT.
PIPER: THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE
THE BEST MARSHMALLOWS.
PLACE IT IN QUITE
A SMALL PLACE
AND MAKE SURE
IT'S QUITE A HOT PLACE.
DON'T PUT IT IN
FOR TOO LONG.
TRY SOME OF THIS.
- MMM, DO I HAVE TO?
- YES.
- IT'S REALLY GOOD.
-
DAISY:
MMM.
THESE ARE ACTUALLY
PRETTY GOOD.
WHAT'S UP WITH THEM?
IT'S PROBABLY SALLY JUST
GETTING INTO THE HOUSE.
- THEY CAN HEAR FOR MILES.
- PIPER: SALLY'S OUR AU PAIR.
SHE'S GOT
DOUBLE-JOINTED THUMBS.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
I'D BETTER GET HOME.
IT'S SNOWING.
GET THE STUFF.
WE'RE GOING.
PIPER, COME ON.
WE'RE GOING NOW.

THE PHONE'S NOT WORKING.
ISAAC: I BET MOM'S ALREADY
ON HER WAY HOME.
SHE'S NOT GONNA
STICK AROUND IN GENEVA
- ONCE SHE KNOWS WHAT'S
HAPPENED HERE, IS SHE?
- NO WAY.
ISAAC: SHE'LL PROBABLY BE
ON THE NEXT FLIGHT HOME.
MOM'S AN EXPERT.
SHE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WE'VE JUST GOTTA WAIT.

WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE 17.
OR 25, YOU KNOW?
DAISY.
BUT WHAT IF WE CAN
GET THROUGH THIS...
AND THERE'S LIFE
ON THE OTHER SIDE?
IF THERE IS,
I WANNA BE HERE
WITH YOU.
THIS IS HOW
I WANNA LIVE.
AND IF ALL THIS ISN'T HERE

THEN I DON'T WANNA
LIVE AT ALL.
NO!

DAYS' WALK AHEAD OF US.
WE NEED TO BE
DISCIPLINED.
COME ON.
THE BOYS ARE WAITING.
WATER TABLETS. SHIT!

I FORGOT THE FUCKING WATER TABLETS!
WE NEED TO SAVE THAT.
I KNEW I'D FUCK IT UP.
GOD DAMN IT, DAISY.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE OPEN.

DO YOU THINK
EDDIE AND ISAAC

CHOCOLATES!

DAISY.
I'M TIRED.
MY FEET HURT.
I NEED WATER!
WE'VE BEEN WALKING
FOR HOURS.
I'M TIRED.
- DAISY.
- WILL YOU SHUT UP?! I AM SO SICK
OF YOUR STUPID,
WHINY VOICE ALL THE TIME.
DO YOU WANT ME TO JUST
LEAVE YOU HERE?
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
I'M GONNA DO.
IF YOU DON'T
SHUT THE FUCK UP,
I AM GONNA RUN AND YOU'RE GONNA
BE LEFT HERE ON YOUR OWN
IN THE DARK AND YOU'RE
GONNA DIE OUT HERE.
DO YOU WANNA SEE
YOUR BROTHERS AGAIN?
WELL, COME ON.
PIPER.
PIPER!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IT MIGHT BE POISON.
- I FORGOT!
- WELL, YOU CAN'T FORGET, OKAY?
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE SOURCE,
YOU CAN'T TRUST THE WATER.
AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE EATEN ALL
THAT CHOCOLATE. THAT WAS STUPID.
MOMMY SAYS I'M A MONSTER
FOR CHOCOLATES.
I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF.
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
SHE WENT AWAY.
WHAT?
'CAUSE I WAS GREEDY.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE AROUND ME ANYMORE!
HEY.
SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY
THINGS THEY DON'T MEAN.
YOUR MOM LOVES YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING.
AND SHE'S
SO PROUD OF YOU.
- I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT.
- HOW?
WELL, I'M OLDER
THAN YOU AND...
IT'S JUST SOMETHING I KNOW.
AND LISTEN,
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,
I'M SORRY I SAID THAT STUFF.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT, OKAY?
COME ON.
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE DIRTY
NOT BECAUSE
THEY'RE CLEAN
NOT BECAUSE I KISSED
A BOY BEHIND A MAGAZINE
BOYS, BOYS,
HAVING ALL THE FUN
SHE CAN EVEN
DO THE SPLITS
BUT I BET YOU 10 BUCKS
SHE CAN'T DO THIS.
- DAISY?
- HMM?
WHAT WAS
YOUR MOMMY LIKE?
I NEVER REALLY MET HER.
HOW COME?
SHE DIED
WHILE I WAS BEING BORN.
DO YOU MISS HER?
YEAH,
SOMETIMES.
IF SHE'D NEVER HAD ME,
SHE'D PROBABLY STILL BE ALIVE.
WE'VE GOT WALKING TO DO.
I HATE WALKING.
WHEN I GET HOME, I'M NEVER
GOING TO WALK AGAIN.
LOOK. LOOK!
THAT'S THE BOYS' PLACE.
GATESFIELD. THAT'S WHERE
THEY'VE TAKEN EDDIE AND ISAAC.
I TOLD YOU,
THEY'VE GONE HOME ALREADY.
BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE.
JUST 'CAUSE
YOU HAD A DREAM,
WHO SAYS
THE DREAM'S REAL?
OKAY,
COME ON.
YES. COME ON.
AS SOON AS I SEE
EDDIE AND ISAAC,
I'M GONNA GIVE THEM
A BIG HUG. AH.
WHERE IS EVERYONE?
-
-
PIPER:
WHAT WAS THAT?
STAY HERE, OKAY?
-
-
-
-
ARE YOU HERE?
ITCHING, RASHES,
WATER TABLETS.
CERTAIN DEGREE OF WILLPOWER
AND SELF-DISCIPLINE.
- WHAT WAS IN THERE?
- COME ON.
WE NEED TO GET AWAY
FROM HERE.
WHERE ARE MY BROTHERS?
I DON'T KNOW.
COME ON.
EDDIE.
ARE YOU OKAY?
CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME A SIGN
OR SOMETHING?
EDDIE?
AHH.
DAISY: DON'T WORRY.
IT'S NOT FAR NOW.
WE SHOULD BE HOME
TOMORROW.
REALLY?
I'VE SAVED A PIECE OF CHOCOLATE.
DO YOU WANT IT NOW?
QUICK.
GO! QUICK.
COME ON, PIPER!
COME ON!
COME ON.
QUICK.
- COME ON!
-
HURRY UP.
COME ON.
IN HERE.
QUICK.
OH, YOU'RE A BIG RABBIT,
AREN'T YOU?
- PIPER: GET OFF OF ME!
-  HEY.
- NO! GET OFF!
- I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.
- HEY.
- LET HER GO!
I SAID
LET HER GO NOW!
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?
DON'T MOVE ANY CLOSER.
WE'RE ONLY WINDING
YOU UP, LOVE, EH?
COME ON, LITTLE LADY.
IT'S JUST A BIT OF FUN.
TAKE IT EASY NOW.
TAKE IT EASY. TAKE IT EASY.
CALM DOWN.
TAKE IT EASY.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY--
-
FIND A GOAL IN LIFE.
THEY STAY IN. STOP.
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
HURRY THE FUCK UP.
STAY AWAY FROM DISTRACTIONS.
TAKE RISKS.
STEP OUT OF YOUR-- SHE ALMOST GOT--
ACCEPT LIFE IS UNFAIR.
FOCUS ON YOUR GOAL.
- OH GOD!
- THAT'S FOR TOUCHING MY COUSIN
WITH YOUR DIRTY,
DISGUSTING FINGERS!
-
-
-
- THE MAP.
MAP.
THE COMPASS.
THE MAP.
THE MAP. OH SHIT.
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE ARE.
THIS SEEMS LIKE
A NICE PLACE.
WHY DON'T WE JUST STAY HERE?
OKAY.
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF WE JUST...
STAY HERE.
IT'S EDDIE'S HAWK.
LOOK.
COME ON.
COME ON.
IT'S TAKING US HOME.
I TOLD YOU, DIDN'T I?
EDDIE'S HOME.
MAYBE THEY'RE
AT THE BARN.
DAISY:
EDDIE?
PIPER:
JET!
JET.
DAISY, IT'S JET.
- OH, JET!
-
OH, I LOVE YOU, JET.
YOU'RE BLEEDING.
WHAT HAPPENED?
LOOK AT ME.
AND I WILL NEVER
LET YOU GO.
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?
HE'S IN THE WOODS.
EDDIE?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
EDDIE.
I NEED YOU.
PLEASE.
I LOVE YOU.
PLEASE.
EDDIE?
-
- IT'S ME.
EDDIE?
EDDIE, IT'S OKAY.
- IT'S ME.
-
- YOU'RE HOME.
-
YOU'RE HOME.
BEFORE THE WAR,
I USED MY WILLPOWER
FOR STUPID STUFF,
I THINK I THOUGHT
IF I COULD CONTROL MYSELF,
THEN MAYBE THE WORLD AROUND ME
WOULD START TO MAKE SENSE.
I GUESS I WAS
PRETTY NAIVE BACK THEN.
DURING THE WAR
WE ALL LEARNED
TO STOP LOOKING FOR REASONS
WHY THINGS HAPPEN.
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO EDDIE,
-
- ...THE THINGS HE HAD TO DO.
HIS BURNS AND SCARS
ARE STARTING TO HEAL,
WOMAN ON RADIO:
...ANNOUNCING EARLIER TODAY
THAT A RUNWAY AT HEATHROW
IS DUE TO REOPEN.
THE AIRPORT WILL BE
WORKING AT 10% CAPACITY.
THAT SINCE THE CEASEFIRE
WAS ANNOUNCED,
ELECTRICITY SERVICES
HAVE RETURNED TO NORMAL
THE NEW GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES
THAT WITHIN THREE MONTHS
80% OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE
RETURNED TO PRE-WAR LEVELS.
RAIL SERVICES ARE CURRENTLY
OPERATING AT 15%.
ISAAC'S GONE,
ISN'T HE?
PIPER:
WILL EDDIE BE OKAY?
YEAH, HE'LL BE OKAY.
HE JUST NEEDS TIME.
NOW I USE MY WILLPOWER
TO WAIT FOR YOU, EDDIE,
TO CARE FOR YOU
I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT ONE DAY
YOU'RE GOING TO GET BETTER.
DID YOU FINISH
YOUR DRINK?
"YES, THANK YOU, DAISY.
IT WAS LOVELY."
-
- OH!
OW. DOES IT HURT?
'CAUSE LIKE I
SAID TO YOU ALL THAT TIME AGO,
AND THAT'S
HOW I LIVE NOW.
WE LIVED
IN A GARDEN'S HEART
AND OPENED IT UP
FOR THE SKY
THE WORLD
SPUN ITSELF AWAY
BUT I WAS COMING ALIVE
BY YOUR SIDE
AND NOW THE SKY
IS SNOWING OUT
AND WE ARE TALKING
FROM SO FAR AWAY
I HEAR A WHISPER
IN THE TREES
YOU NEED TO FIND
A WAY BACK HERE
THE SPACE THAT IS
IN BETWEEN
YOU NEED TO FIND
A WAY BACK HERE
THE SPACE THAT
IS IN BETWEEN
WHERE I AM YOU
AND YOU ARE ME
WHERE I AM YOU
AND YOU ARE ME
WHERE I AM YOU
AND YOU ARE ME
