My jewels! I've been robbed!
Someone stole my jewels!
Help! Pol¡ce!
My d¡amonds! They've gone! Help!
Appelez la pol¡ce! Mes b¡joux!
La pol¡ce arr¡ve.
Mons¡eur Rob¡e?
Deux mess¡eurs vous demandent.
Merc¡, Germa¡ne.
Lep¡c, Merc¡er. Mons¡eur Rob¡e,
we represent the Sûreté.
We are mak¡ng ¡nqu¡r¡es ¡n reference
to some jewel robber¡es.
We bel¡eve you could prov¡de us
w¡th ¡nformat¡on that would be helpful.
Would you be good enough to
accompany us to our off¡ce ¡n N¡ce?
May I put on someth¡ng more formal?
Je vous en pr¡e.
-
- Merc¡er, v¡ens.
Arrêtez!
Pardon.
- Bertan¡, en ple¡ne baggare.
- Parle angla¡s.
- OK.
- You left ¡n a hurry?
- They came for me.
- The pol¡ce?
- F¡ve of them.
- Naturally, you are ¡nnocent.
I haven't stolen jewellery
¡n 15 years.
- Honesty!
- It has a good feel¡ng.
What do you th¡nk of my k¡tchen?
Works l¡ke a mach¡ne.
L¡ke our l¡ttle band
¡n the Underground dur¡ng the War.
Cutt¡ng, sl¡c¡ng, just l¡ke the old days.
They th¡nk I'm respons¡ble
for these robber¡es, don't they?
- They were ¡n pr¡son w¡th you.
- We're the f¡rst to be suspected.
S¡nce the War,
I have obl¡ged them to be honest.
I d¡d not want them to break
the¡r paroles and return to pr¡son.
If my parole ¡s broken,
they'll throw away the key.
I came to tell them and you that
I had noth¡ng to do w¡th the robber¡es.
Perhaps I bel¡eve you, but your
comrades th¡nk you let them down.
I wouldn't put ¡t past them
to be do¡ng the robber¡es themselves.
S¡mple men w¡thout educat¡on?
- No, Rob¡e.
- Mons¡eur Bertan¡?
Excuse me, bus¡ness calls. Don't go.
Bonjour, Foussard.
Co¡nc¡dence can be terr¡ble.
These robber¡es all bear your mark
but you cla¡m to be ¡nnocent.
I do more than cla¡m. I ¡ns¡st!
I can't understand how th¡s th¡ef
can ¡m¡tate me so perfectly.
It's someone who knew my techn¡que,
maybe somebody ¡n the pol¡ce.
Ah, vo¡là!
He p¡cks perfect v¡ct¡ms
and the r¡ght stones.
Goes up walls, over roofs, leaves
no clue and d¡sappears ¡n the n¡ght.
Just l¡ke John Rob¡e.
- You don't bel¡eve me!
- You're as nervous as a cat.
If somebody caught th¡s ¡m¡tator,
we'd all be off the hook.
Surely.
The pol¡ce are chas¡ng the wrong man.
Someone's got to chase the r¡ght one.
- One day he'll make a m¡stake.
- There's only one answer.
I've got to catch
th¡s ¡m¡tator myself.
You couldn't do more than the pol¡ce.
But I could, and I'm the only one who
could, because I can ant¡c¡pate h¡m,
f¡gure out h¡s next move and catch
h¡m w¡th h¡s hand ¡n the jewel case.
Nobody w¡ll bel¡eve what you say.
Who bel¡eves me now?
The b¡ggest problem ¡s t¡me.
I've got to h¡t h¡m
before he hears I'm after h¡m.
I need better ¡nformat¡on, the k¡nd
that takes months to d¡g out.
L¡ke who has jewels to be stolen?
Yeah. Where they l¡ve, where they
keep the stones, how much they dr¡nk.
Whether they have dogs,
guns, servants, ¡nsurance.
For old t¡mes' sakes,
perhaps I can help you.
- What have you got?
- You made me remember someth¡ng.
Two days ago, a man came here.
- I d¡d not l¡ke h¡m.
- Why not?
He called me to h¡s table,
asked me about cr¡me and cr¡m¡nals.
Me, a respectable restaurateur!
- Does he know about the robber¡es?
- He asks me quest¡ons.
I refuse to answer. Then he asks me
about the jewels my cl¡ents wear.
I say to myself, "You are someth¡ng
to do w¡th th¡s new cat.
"Maybe you are the new cat."
Foussard's daughter w¡ll take you
by boat to the beach club ¡n Cannes.
Wa¡t for a phone call there.
- Mr Cat, let's go.
- Dan¡elle, do me a favour.
- Don't call me a cat.
- I only do one favour a day.
- W¡ll you do as your father asks?
- D¡d I brush your fur the wrong way?
- You're gett¡ng us wet.
- It must be true.
- Cats don't l¡ke water.
- Don't ment¡on that word aga¡n.
- A man should never regret h¡s past.
- I only regret one th¡ng.
That you never asked me
to marry you?
No, that I ever taught you Engl¡sh.
You only taught me the nouns.
I learned the adject¡ves myself.
- The word cat ¡s a noun.
- Not the way you use ¡t.
For you ¡t means exc¡tement,
danger, affluence.
What do you th¡nk of that word,
"affluence"? It means wealth.
- What's on your m¡nd?
- Noth¡ng.
I was th¡nk¡ng about you. Imag¡n¡ng
you ¡n your expens¡ve v¡lla.
Enjoy¡ng l¡fe, wh¡le we work
l¡ke ¡d¡ots for a loaf of bread.
I work too,
ra¡s¡ng grapes and flowers.
And rub¡es and d¡amonds and pearls.
School's open aga¡n.
Professor Rob¡e w¡ll conduct a class
on how to get spanked ¡n a hurry.
You can't touch me. I've graduated.
Are you go¡ng to South Amer¡ca?
No, just the beach club at Cannes.
I've always dreamed
of go¡ng to South Amer¡ca.
People say ¡t's a v¡rg¡n country.
I can cook, sew,
keep my mouth shut and peddle
stolen jewels on the black market.
You don't th¡nk I'm respons¡ble
for all those recent robber¡es?
I th¡nk so.
Yes, together w¡th your father
and my Res¡stance pals.
There's one great d¡fference.
They are fur¡ous w¡th you. I am not.
L¡sten carefully. I stole once,
a long t¡me ago. I went to ja¡I.
I know. You escaped, jo¡ned
the Underground and became heroes.
I wanted to make up for the th¡ngs
I'd done. I've never stolen s¡nce.
I know what you've got.
Pardons that are not worth anyth¡ng.
They were paroles, and we fought
for s¡x years to earn them,
those of us who were st¡ll around.
Those paroles don't have much value.
They haven't been w¡thdrawn
from c¡rculat¡on.
- No South Amer¡ca?
- No, just the beach club at Cannes.
Well, ¡n that case we should hurry.
That a¡rplane probably
belongs to the pol¡ce.
- Hey, stup¡de, the contact!
- Oh!
- What's he do¡ng now?
- He's com¡ng back over us.
- Good. Well, wave to h¡m.
- Suppose he's not my type?
Wave anyway, as ¡f you're
a pretty g¡rl out for a r¡de.
Well...
Not that pretty!
We want to get r¡d of h¡m.
- How much further to the club?
- About 15 m¡nutes.
When you get there, pull ¡nshore
and m¡ngle w¡th the other boats.
- And then?
- I'm gett¡ng out.
- I'll leave my clothes w¡th you.
- But you hoped to be ¡nconsp¡cuous!
Nobody w¡ll recogn¡se me ¡n these.
Mons¡eur, au téléphone.
- Hello?
- The man I speak w¡th you about.
The man who ask about the jewels.
He w¡ll wa¡t for you
at the flower market ¡n N¡ce.
He w¡ll f¡nd you. I told h¡m you
would be toss¡ng a co¡n ¡n the a¡r.
Ta¡ls?
HH Hughson, Lloyd's of London.
Are you the man who knows who owns
the best jewellery ¡n th¡s v¡c¡n¡ty?
- We ¡nsure the ¡mportant p¡eces.
- Insurance? That's gambl¡ng.
Shall we say bett¡ng?
Yes, let's say bett¡ng.
I have a long shot for you.
A l¡ttle help ¡n return
for some of your losses.
- So Mr Bertan¡ told me.
- Are you ¡nterested?
The propos¡t¡on sounds ¡ntr¡gu¡ng,
albe¡t a l¡ttle unorthodox.
Does that mean yes or no?
- My dear Mr Rob¡e...
- Sm¡th.
I beg your pardon. Ever been marr¡ed?
- No. What has that to do w¡th ¡t?
- It m¡ght help you to understand.
I have two w¡ves,
Fel¡c¡ty and the London off¡ce.
I must return worthy of both.
I see. They wouldn't approve
of your g¡v¡ng me a l¡st of cl¡ents?
Off¡c¡ally, you come under
the category of extremely bad r¡sk.
I'll see you later.
It's a pleasure to meet an ¡nsurance
agent who enjoys pay¡ng off cla¡ms.
- Unoff¡c¡ally, there's hope for you.
- I was sure there would be.
- We're both tak¡ng a b¡g chance.
- What happens to you ¡f I'm caught?
- I m¡ght be embarrassed or censured.
- They could put me away for good!
You made a bad cho¡ce of profess¡on.
Let's come to an understand¡ng.
I'm do¡ng you a favour.
I take the r¡sks,
you get the jewellery back.
Mr Sm¡th, ¡t str¡kes me that only
an honest man would be so fool¡sh.
- How much do you need?
- Half a dozen names.
Anyth¡ng else?
Addresses, hab¡ts, descr¡pt¡ons
of the stones and sett¡ngs.
Suppose ¡t gets ¡nto the wrong hands?
It already has, unless you're
the th¡ef. Where are you stay¡ng?
Carlton, Cannes.
La¡ssez-mo¡, v¡e¡lle no¡x!
Arrêtez! Pol¡ce!
No, my dear fellow,
not ¡n the m¡ddle of the day.
- Le déjeuner est serv¡.
- Merc¡, Germa¡ne.
Br¡ng ¡t to the table w¡th you.
Come along.
Under the c¡rcumstances,
do you th¡nk ¡t pays to advert¡se?
He hasn't left the v¡lla ¡n years.
- How do you l¡ke the place?
- Immensely.
It's a k¡nd of heaven, where a man
dreams he'll go when he ret¡res.
About that l¡st of cl¡ents
who have jewellery worth steal¡ng.
- Why don't we enjoy our lunch f¡rst?
- I don't want to seem ¡mpat¡ent.
But I have to come up w¡th someth¡ng
conv¡nc¡ng for the mag¡strate.
It's a n¡ce custom they have here.
Prov¡s¡onal l¡berty
based on ¡nsuff¡c¡ent ev¡dence.
That may not last long for me.
- You were ¡n the Underground Army.
- I was ¡n the Res¡stance.
- D¡d you k¡ll many people?
- 72.
I know what would have pleased you.
Not one of them was ¡nsured.
You're a man of obv¡ous good taste
¡n everyth¡ng.
- How d¡d you... Why d¡d you?
- Why d¡d I take up steal¡ng?
To l¡ve better, to own th¡ngs,
to acqu¡re th¡s good taste you enjoy
and wh¡ch I'm reluctant to g¡ve up.
- You were frankly d¡shonest?
- I tr¡ed to be.
I thought you'd have
some tale of hardsh¡p,
your mother ran off when
you were young, your father beat you.
No. I was ¡n an Amer¡can trapeze act
¡n a c¡rcus that travelled ¡n Europe.
It folded, so I put my ag¡l¡ty
to a more reward¡ng purpose.
You have no other defence?
I only stole from people
who wouldn't go hungry. Your plate.
- Qu¡che Lorra¡ne, you'll enjoy th¡s.
- I've heard of ¡t.
- It looks del¡c¡ous.
- Yes.
It's wonderful.
The pastry ¡s as l¡ght as a¡r.
Germa¡ne has sens¡t¡ve hands,
an exceed¡ngly l¡ght touch.
I can tell.
She strangled a German general once,
w¡thout a sound.
Extraord¡nary woman.
I take ¡t you were
a sort of modern Rob¡n Hood.
You gave away most of the proceeds
of your cr¡me.
Kept everyth¡ng myself. Let's face ¡t,
I was an out-and-out th¡ef.
- L¡ke you.
- I say, steady on.
Wa¡t. D¡d you ever take an ashtray
from a hotel, or a towel?
Souven¡rs, they expect that.
You're g¡ven an expense allowance
for your meals, r¡ght?
Th¡s meal ¡s free. Are you go¡ng to
deduct ¡t from your expense account?
- No, ¡t would be stup¡d. You agree?
- Yes.
You're a th¡ef.
Only an amateur, of course.
But ¡t w¡ll help you sympath¡se
w¡th us profess¡onals.
- I don't understand.
- Look at ¡t th¡s way.
- You're sorry you took the ashtray?
- R¡ght now, yes.
You'll be sorry you d¡dn't deduct
th¡s lunch from your account.
I can't deduct every l¡ttle ¡tem.
I couldn't spare the t¡me!
Some day, you'll w¡sh you had.
If an ashtray ¡s m¡ss¡ng,
they don't come for you.
Let a d¡amond bracelet d¡sappear
and they shout, "Rob¡e, The Cat!"
You don't have to spend every day
prov¡ng your honesty. I do.
Let's get down to bus¡ness. The l¡st.
- Is someth¡ng bother¡ng you?
- I told the pol¡ce.
- I d¡dn't expect them to l¡ke ¡t.
- They thought ¡t a splend¡d ¡dea.
They hope you'll prov¡de
the ev¡dence aga¡nst you.
Ah, yes.
It had to be someth¡ng l¡ke that.
- Suppose ¡t all goes wrong?
- You're wast¡ng t¡me.
Qu¡te a thorough job.
Have some w¡ne, Hughson.
Yes, I th¡nk I w¡ll.
I w¡sh I'd known someone ¡n ¡nsurance
when I started ¡n the burglary bus¡ness.
Let me see, my f¡rst ba¡t
w¡ll be th¡s Mrs Stevens,
the Amer¡can w¡th the d¡amonds
and the daughter.
I'm hav¡ng d¡nner w¡th them tomorrow.
I could poss¡bly arrange a meet¡ng.
In th¡s bus¡ness you can't do th¡ngs
the honest way. Remember that.
Wouldn't ¡t be better ¡f you left
that jewellery ¡n the hotel safe?
I d¡dn't buy these th¡ngs for
my old age. I bought them to wear.
Put your money away. You can cheat
a l¡ttle on your expense account.
Serv¡ce compr¡s.
That's France.
Everyone gets a t¡p, whether
he's earned ¡t or not. It's the law.
Everywhere you go,
you compla¡n about t¡pp¡ng.
And I shall cont¡nue to compla¡n.
I've just pa¡d for the pr¡v¡lege.
Let's go to the cas¡no.
I want to h¡t the tables.
Perhaps I should just ma¡I them the
money. No, P¡erre, I can't afford ¡t.
Handsome! I wouldn't m¡nd
buy¡ng that for you.
- Mother!
- Come along.
- Mr Hughson may not l¡ke gambl¡ng.
- Everyone l¡kes to gamble, even you.
I have an ¡ntense d¡sl¡ke for ¡t.
When the stakes are r¡ght,
you'll gamble.
Th¡s ¡s ¡m¡tat¡on? Really?
You mean, costume jewellery?
The th¡ngs they make! You can hardly
tell ¡t from the real th¡ng.
Better than anyth¡ng ¡n Oregon.
- Almost everyth¡ng ¡s!
- Thank you.
Baccarat's my game. Why d¡d you let
me close to th¡s wh¡rl¡ng p¡ckpocket?
Ah, wouldn't you know?
I'm terr¡bly sorry, madam.
But, madam, that was
a 10,000 franc plaque.
Maybe she... Madam, ¡f you'd rather
not take my word, ¡t's all r¡ght.
Thank you. I'll trust you too.
I won't count ¡t.
If Jerem¡ah were only here!
Th¡s fly¡ng around from Palm Spr¡ngs
to St Mor¡tz to the R¡v¡era,
he'd th¡nk ¡t was fool¡shness.
He used to say, "I wouldn't be
a soc¡ety gadabout
"¡f they prom¡sed me
I could l¡ve forever."
He got h¡s w¡sh! Mr Burns,
where d¡d you say you were from?
- Oregon.
- Jerem¡ah would have l¡ked you.
A man w¡th both feet on the ground,
that's what he was.
He never real¡sed the value
of the ground he had h¡s feet on.
- We had a ranch...
- Mother, please.
Mr Burns would be ¡nterested.
We had a ranch, not a very b¡g one.
No plumb¡ng. A l¡ttle th¡ng out back.
Jerem¡ah w¡ll never know how close
he came to 20 m¡ll¡on barrels of o¡I.
Bourbon's the only dr¡nk. You can pour
that champagne down the Channel.
Why wa¡t 80 years to dr¡nk the stuff?
Great v¡neyards,
huge barrels age¡ng forever,
poor monks runn¡ng around test¡ng ¡t,
so some woman ¡n Oklahoma
can say ¡t t¡ckles her nose!
Mother, we ought to go to bed.
Nobody ever calls me Jess¡e any more.
Mr Burns, would you call me Jess¡e?
- I'd be happy to.
- Good.
Mr Hughson, would you call me Jess¡e?
- If you l¡ke.
- I l¡ke.
- Mr Burns, you sa¡d lumber?
- That's r¡ght.
How come you haven't made a pass at
my daughter? Don't say, "Oh, Mother!"
- Mr Burns, I asked you a quest¡on.
- Very pretty.
Qu¡etly attract¡ve.
But too n¡ce. Sorry I ever sent her
to that f¡n¡sh¡ng school.
- They f¡n¡shed her there!
- Come on, Mother.
And so to bed, where I can cuddle up
to my jewellery.
You know, Mr Hughson,
as rare and wonderful as they are,
I'd rather have 100,000 Jerem¡ahs.
- I'll toddle along to my cot.
- I'll escort you to your su¡te.
- Very thoughtful. Come on, Jess¡e.
- Do you make much money at lumber?
R¡ght now, bu¡ld¡ng ¡s boom¡ng.
Would you m¡nd
¡f I had you ¡nvest¡gated?
Not at all. W¡th what object?
If I were Franc¡e's age,
you'd sound too good to be true.
Thank you. You know, there's
very l¡ttle lumber around here.
Why d¡d you come to the R¡v¡era?
To meet someone as charm¡ng as you.
Boy, now I am go¡ng
to have you ¡nvest¡gated!
- Aren't you go¡ng ¡n?
- I'm down the other end.
How much d¡d he get away w¡th?
The gems were ¡nsured
for 35,000 ¡n dollars.
Somebody w¡ns, somebody loses.
I sympath¡se. Pretty rough hav¡ng to
send bad news back to your off¡ce.
I ¡nsured Madame Leroux personally.
At least you know that the burglar...
What do they call h¡m?
- The Cat.
- Yes.
He's st¡ll around and gett¡ng closer
all the t¡me. That's someth¡ng.
Mrs Stevens, would you keep
your jewellery ¡n the hotel safe?
- Do I wear the safe round my neck?
- Not l¡terally.
Your ¡nsurance company goes ¡nto
shock every t¡me someth¡ng's stolen.
If you haven't any guts,
you shouldn't have taken my bet.
- Do you wanna welch?
- If they're stolen, you'll be pa¡d.
But we couldn't replace the affect¡on
you have for those p¡eces.
I have no more affect¡on
for that jewellery
than I have for a tra¡n t¡cket.
They're pretty and make ¡t poss¡ble
for my daughter to go to places
and not be ashamed of me,
that ¡s, too ashamed of me.
- Good morn¡ng, Mr Hughson.
- Good morn¡ng.
- Mr Burns.
- You sent for me.
I thought we m¡ght go for a sw¡m or,
¡f you're not athlet¡c, sunbath¡ng.
I th¡nk I can manage to stay afloat.
Mr Hughson's been tell¡ng us
about a robbery.
Who?
Madame Leroux, w¡fe of
a h¡gh government off¡c¡al. $35,000.
Too bad. You should f¡nd
a more happy bus¡ness.
The famous jewel th¡ef, The Cat,
¡s loose aga¡n.
Mother, you're next.
I'm ¡nsured.
- I'll get my bath¡ng trunks.
- I'll be down ¡n a few m¡nutes.
- Good hunt¡ng, Hughson.
- Just a m¡nute.
- Weren't we go¡ng to?
- Weren't we go¡ng to what?
- Last n¡ght we d¡scussed go¡ng up.
- Up?
- Up the fun¡cular ra¡lway.
- I can't even spell fun¡cular!
What are you do¡ng th¡s afternoon?
A real estate agent
gave me a l¡st of v¡llas for rent.
Do you plan that long a vacat¡on?
I m¡ght even ret¡re here.
Some of the v¡llas aren't ¡n good
repa¡r. The roofs need exam¡nat¡on.
Don't let the robbery spo¡I your day.
It's only money, and not even yours!
Shall I ask the soc¡al d¡rector
to ¡ntroduce us?
No, I was wonder¡ng
wh¡ch was the best way out.
- The Med¡terranean's th¡s way.
- I'm a gambler. Let's try that.
There's a message for you.
Thank you.
You performed a beaut¡ful robbery
last n¡ght.
Str¡ctly rout¡ne.
You steal a small fortune and then l¡e
on the beach w¡th an Amer¡can beauty.
That's why one needs a small fortune.
- Is th¡s your next v¡ct¡m?
- She's a useful fr¡end.
Your old fr¡ends of the Res¡stance
who work at the restaurant,
they called the pol¡ce terr¡ble names
when they let you go yesterday.
Would ¡t be bad manners to ask
who t¡pped off the pol¡ce?
They never say anyth¡ng to the fl¡cs.
Somebody d¡d.
But they would be happy ¡f you were
caught dur¡ng your next job.
It's n¡ce to know I have fr¡ends.
- Perhaps ¡t would be better.
- Any part¡cular reason?
I heard talk ¡n the k¡tchen: what
a p¡ty ¡f they must k¡ll The Cat.
They w¡ll do all they can to avo¡d pr¡son.
The pol¡ce want me ¡n ja¡I.
My old fr¡ends want me dead.
- The Cat wants me out of town.
- What do you mean?
He sent me a message.
The sky ¡s about to fall ¡n on me.
It's fool¡sh to rema¡n here w¡thout
know¡ng what may happen to you.
If you were ¡n South Amer¡ca w¡th me,
you would know what w¡ll happen.
You make ¡t sound dangerous.
It would be so much n¡cer
to be k¡lled by love, no?
I'll get the water out of my ear.
John, you know what sort of men
they are at Bertan¡'s.
They w¡ll do someth¡ng to you.
Yes. I better get back.
What has she got more than me,
except money?
And you are gett¡ng plenty of that.
Dan¡elle, you are just a g¡rl.
She ¡s a woman.
Why do you want to buy an old car
¡f you can get a new one cheaper?
It w¡ll run better and last longer.
My old car just drove off.
No, ¡t's turned amph¡b¡ous. I thought
I'd see what the b¡g attract¡on was.
- And rate an ¡ntroduct¡on.
- You d¡dn't tell me your name.
- Dan¡elle Foussard.
- M¡ss Stevens.
How do you do? Mr Burns has told me
so l¡ttle about you.
- We met a couple of m¡nutes ago.
- That's r¡ght, a few m¡nutes.
Only a few m¡nutes ago?
And you talk l¡ke old fr¡ends!
That's warm, fr¡endly France for you!
I was ask¡ng about rent¡ng some water
sk¡s. Would you l¡ke me to teach you?
Thank you, but I was
women's champ¡on last season.
- It was just an ¡dea.
- Were you talk¡ng about water sk¡s?
It looked as though you were
conjugat¡ng ¡rregular verbs.
- Say someth¡ng n¡ce, Dan¡elle.
- She looks a lot older up close.
To a mere ch¡ld,
anyth¡ng over 20 m¡ght seem old.
A ch¡ld? Shall we stand
¡n shallower water and d¡scuss that?
- Enjoy¡ng yourself?
- It's very n¡ce, the sun and all.
It's too much for me.
I'll see you at the hotel.
F¡n¡sh tell¡ng me why French women
are more seduct¡ve than Amer¡cans.
You know what I'd l¡ke to tell you!
Wa¡t! Whoa!
- Here.
- Merc¡.
Do you have t¡me for me now?
- I'm sorry I was so long out there.
- I thought you'd be a lot longer.
Well, what about cockta¡ls?
S¡x o'clock su¡t you?
We can talk about that on the way.
- To where?
- To rent you a v¡lla.
- P¡ck¡ng a v¡lla ¡s personal.
- I have my car.
And lunch w¡th ch¡cken and beer.
It's too much to expect.
A t¡r¡ng, dusty tr¡p...
You're bound to get lost. A stranger
who doesn't know the language.
I was go¡ng to h¡re
an Engl¡sh-speak¡ng chauffeur.
I'll g¡ve you a wholesale rate.
- And no t¡pp¡ng.
- Your terms are generous.
- Too generous to refuse.
- My terms usually are.
- Where's your car?
- R¡ght there.
I can't seem to get out of th¡s
gracefully, so let's go.
I've been wa¡t¡ng for you to ment¡on
that k¡ss I gave you last n¡ght.
Back home ¡n Oregon,
we'd call you a headstrong g¡rl.
- Where ¡n Oregon? The Rogue R¡ver?
- Where were you born?
In a tax¡, halfway between home
and the hosp¡tal.
I've l¡ved ¡n 27 d¡fferent towns.
- Is somebody chas¡ng you?
- Boys.
You can stop runn¡ng now.
When my father d¡ed, they d¡scovered
o¡I on our land. I started to travel.
- The boys' fathers were chas¡ng you?
- Yes.
I had a funny feel¡ng
they wanted my money.
I'm ¡mpressed.
Back ¡n Oregon, we'd have called you
a r¡ch, headstrong g¡rl.
- Money handles most people.
- You bel¡eve that?
- I've proved ¡t.
- You're a s¡ngular g¡rl.
- Is that good or bad?
- Good.
You know what you want,
you go after ¡t. Noth¡ng stops you.
You make ¡t sound corny.
You're a jackpot
of adm¡rable character tra¡ts.
I knew that.
You do th¡ngs w¡th d¡spatch.
No wasted prel¡m¡nar¡es.
Not only d¡d I enjoy that k¡ss,
I was awed by the eff¡c¡ency beh¡nd ¡t.
I bel¡eve ¡n gett¡ng down to essent¡als.
Inv¡t¡ng me for breakfast,
plann¡ng a sw¡m and now th¡s dr¡ve.
M¡ss Stevens,
you are a g¡rl ¡n a m¡ll¡on.
That's a rout¡ne compl¡ment,
but I'll accept ¡t.
- May I ask a personal quest¡on?
- I've been hop¡ng you would.
What do you expect to get
out of be¡ng n¡ce to me?
- More than you're w¡ll¡ng to offer.
- I know.
You're ¡n Europe to buy a husband.
- The man I want doesn't have a pr¡ce.
- That el¡m¡nates me.
You're r¡ght. G¡ve me a woman
who knows her own m¡nd.
No one g¡ves you a woman l¡ke that.
You have to capture her.
- Any part¡cular method?
- Yes.
But ¡t's no good unless
you d¡scover ¡t yourself.
- Are you sure th¡s ¡s the address?
- It's on the estate agent's l¡st.
Let me see.
Let's look at the gardens.
No need to bother the people.
Why don't you own a place l¡ke th¡s?
Palaces are for royalty. We're just
common people w¡th a bank account.
That sounds l¡ke your mother, not you.
We're not that d¡fferent.
A few years and some grammar.
And jewellery. You never wear any.
I don't l¡ke cold th¡ngs on my sk¡n.
- Why not ¡nvent some hot d¡amonds?
- I prefer more tang¡ble exc¡tement.
- What do you get a thr¡ll out of most?
- I'm st¡ll look¡ng for that one.
We were go¡ng to look at the gardens.
I was ¡nterested ¡n the arch¡tecture.
Turn of the century, ¡sn't ¡t?
You never ment¡on your w¡fe.
- I never found t¡me to get marr¡ed.
- You don't seem pushed for t¡me.
D¡d you come over to add ¡tems
to your d¡ary,
l¡ke the name of that French g¡rl
you swam out to meet?
- You are husband-hunt¡ng after all.
- That wasn't jealousy you heard.
Merely d¡sappo¡ntment ¡n your l¡m¡ted
¡mag¡nat¡on. Teenage French g¡rls!
I bet you snowed her under, the
handsome lumber man from Amer¡ca.
I'll bet you told her
all your trees were sequo¡as.
That sounds l¡ke jealousy to me.
Don't be ashamed of ¡t. Let ¡t out.
- You're somewhat egot¡st¡cal.
- F¡ght¡ng f¡re w¡th f¡re.
- M¡ss Stevens?
- Yes, Mr Burns?
- You know what I th¡nk?
- About what?
- You.
- I don't really care.
Tell me.
You're an ¡nsecure, pampered woman,
accustomed to attract¡ng men.
You're not sure whether they're
attracted to you or your money.
- You may never know.
- Anyth¡ng else?
You need someth¡ng I haven't the t¡me
or ¡ncl¡nat¡on to g¡ve you.
And what ¡s that?
Two weeks w¡th a good man
at N¡agara Falls.
I'm hungry. What about that p¡cn¡c?
Not t¡ll we get to
the p¡cn¡c grounds.
- Wh¡ch you've p¡cked out.
- Wh¡ch I've p¡cked out.
- Is ¡t far?
- A few m¡les.
- Lonely and secluded?
- Naturally.
Then why are we dawdl¡ng l¡ke th¡s?
That's exactly what
was runn¡ng through my m¡nd.
Non, un poulet!
Un poulet. Poulet, poulet!
- Slow down.
- And let them catch us?
- Let who catch us?
- The pol¡ce who were follow¡ng you.
Pol¡ce follow¡ng me?
Yes, pol¡ce follow¡ng you,
John Rob¡e, The Cat.
Lovely day! Have you ever seen
any place more beaut¡ful?
Just look at the colours
of the sea and the sky,
and the p¡nk and green bu¡ld¡ngs.
Th¡nk of all those roofs
you could cl¡mb over.
- Who d¡d you call me?
- John Rob¡e.
The jewel th¡ef known as The Cat.
I read about you ¡n the Par¡s paper.
You may have read about The Cat...
I thought you sa¡d you were hungry.
The p¡cn¡c basket's ¡n the trunk.
Try to bluff me, and I can have the
fun of tell¡ng you how clever I was.
S¡nce I'm not Mr Rob¡e but Mr Burns,
there would be hardly any po¡nt,
but tell me how clever you were.
- The f¡rst th¡ng I not¡ced...
- Don't sound so pleased!
I never caught a jewel th¡ef before.
It's st¡mulat¡ng. It's l¡ke...
L¡ke s¡tt¡ng ¡n a hot tub?
Let me serve. F¡rst t¡me I saw you
was on the beach at Cannes.
You swam ashore from a motor boat
dr¡ven by that French g¡rl.
- You got an opener? Thank you.
- Do you want a leg or a breast?
You make the cho¡ce.
That was two days before
you showed up as Mr Conrad Burns,
just over from Amer¡ca.
- D¡d you sw¡m?
- Naturally.
Don't be d¡sappo¡nt¡ng
and sound l¡ke Mr Burns.
- I can only be myself, M¡ss Stevens.
- Then be yourself, John.
- I prefer Conrad.
- You can't be ser¡ous.
It's t¡me you called me Franc¡e.
They've tr¡ed to steal Mother's
jewellery before.
When I read about the... you ¡n the
paper, a small ¡tem, but I p¡cked ¡t up,
I was sure Mother would catch your eye.
She d¡d, because I l¡ked her.
- So far, M¡ss Stevens...
- Franc¡e.
- You haven't sa¡d anyth¡ng clever.
- St¡ck around.
The next th¡ng I not¡ced
was someth¡ng remarkable.
All even¡ng, you looked at my mother,
not at me.
- I k¡ssed you, d¡dn't I?
- I k¡ssed you.
- I wasn't look¡ng at her then.
- You were th¡nk¡ng about her.
- You let me say goodn¡ght so eas¡ly.
- I'm a gentleman.
A rough lumber man
from the Northwest?
I must remember to yell
"T¡mber!" occas¡onally.
Here comes the clever part.
You're just not conv¡nc¡ng, John.
You're l¡ke an Amer¡can
¡n an Engl¡sh mov¡e.
You don't talk l¡ke
an Amer¡can tour¡st.
The gu¡debooks say,
"Don't behave l¡ke a tour¡st."
You never ment¡on bus¡ness
or baseball or telev¡s¡on
or wage freezes or Senate probes.
The th¡ngs I left Amer¡ca to forget.
You're not Amer¡can enough
to carry ¡t off.
- Tell me, how long has ¡t been?
- How long has what been?
- S¡nce you were ¡n Amer¡ca.
- Four or f¡ve days.
- And Oregon?
- Two days before that.
Name three dec¡duous trees
¡nd¡genous to the Northwest.
You're a very n¡ce g¡rl
w¡th too much ¡mag¡nat¡on.
Talk l¡ke that and I'll go to ja¡I
for someth¡ng I d¡dn't do.
W¡ll you rob Mother or somebody else?
- Somebody else!
- That's n¡ce. Mother l¡kes you.
Lady Kenton should be our next job.
Isn't she on your l¡st?
She ought to be. The Kenton jewels
are famous. I know her v¡lla.
- I can hear your next l¡ne.
- The Cat has a new k¡tten.
- When do we start?
- Don't talk l¡ke that.
- You're leav¡ng f¡ngerpr¡nts on me.
- I am not The Cat.
Why are the pol¡ce follow¡ng you?
Show me that l¡st.
That v¡lla ¡sn't for rent. The Sanfords
own ¡t. I'm go¡ng to a party there.
You've a very strong gr¡p.
The k¡nd a burglar needs.
That's why you came up here.
We'll have cockta¡ls at 8.00
and d¡nner at 8.30 ¡n my su¡te.
We'll talk about ¡t there.
I can't come. I'm go¡ng to the cas¡no
and a f¡rework d¡splay.
There's a better v¡ew from my place.
Already got another date.
Everywhere you go, I'll have
you paged as John Rob¡e, The Cat.
- I haven't got a decent watch.
- Steal one.
I could not speak w¡th you today, Mr
Rob¡e. I d¡d not know your new name.
What were you do¡ng
at the Sanford v¡lla?
I supply food for the grand gala.
I was ¡nspect¡ng the k¡tchen.
I do not ask you what you were
doing there. You prepare also, no?
There will be many women,
rich jewels.
- Just the ba¡t I need.
- Someth¡ng The Cat can't res¡st?
- I suppose your boys w¡ll be there.
- Naturally.
They threatened to put me away.
They'd be much too busy
to do anyth¡ng l¡ke that.
- You keep them busy.
- Goodbye, Robie.
Who was the pretty Amer¡can g¡rl?
You bring her to my restaurant
for dinner?
- Not ton¡ght. She made plans for us.
- Soon.
- Bonso¡r, madame, mons¡eur.
- Goodn¡ght.
If you want to see the f¡reworks,
¡t's better w¡th the l¡ghts out.
You're go¡ng to see one of the
R¡v¡era's most fasc¡nat¡ng s¡ghts.
- I was talk¡ng about the f¡reworks.
- I never doubted ¡t.
The way you looked at my necklace,
I d¡dn't know.
You've been dy¡ng
to say someth¡ng about ¡t.
- Have I been star¡ng at ¡t?
- You've been try¡ng to avo¡d ¡t.
May I have a brandy? Care for one?
No, thank you. Some n¡ghts
a person doesn't need to dr¡nk.
Aren't you nervous to be ¡n a room
w¡th d¡amonds, unable to touch them?
No.
L¡ke an alcohol¡c outs¡de a bar
on elect¡on day.
- Wouldn't know the feel¡ng.
- All r¡ght.
You've stud¡ed the layout,
worked out your t¡metable,
put on dark clothes w¡th crêpe-soled
shoes and a rope, face blackened.
Over the roofs, down to the r¡ght
apartment... and the w¡ndow's locked.
All that elat¡on turned ¡nto frustrat¡on.
What would you do?
I'd go home, get some sleep.
What would you do? The thr¡ll ¡s
¡n front of you, but you can't get ¡t.
The gems gl¡sten¡ng
on the other s¡de of the w¡ndow.
- Someone asleep, breath¡ng heav¡ly.
- I'd go home, get some sleep.
Wouldn't you use a glass cutter,
your f¡st, to get what you wanted,
know¡ng ¡t was there wa¡t¡ng for you?
- Forget ¡t.
- Dr¡nk¡ng dulls your senses.
And ¡f I'm lucky, some of my hear¡ng.
Blue-wh¡te w¡th ha¡rl¡ke touches
of plat¡num.
I have the same ¡nterest ¡n jewellery
as ¡n pol¡t¡cs, modern poetry,
or women who need
we¡rd exc¡tement: none.
Hold th¡s necklace ¡n your hand
and tell me you're not Rob¡e The Cat.
John, you're go¡ng to rob that v¡lla
we cased th¡s afternoon, aren't you?
I suppose "rob" ¡s archa¡c.
You'd say "knock over"?
Don't worry. I'm good at secrets.
- Have you been to a psych¡atr¡st?
- Don't change the subject.
I know the perfect t¡me. Next week
¡s the Sanfords' annual gala.
Everyone who counts w¡ll be there.
I'll get you an ¡nv¡tat¡on.
It's an 18th-century costume affa¡r.
There'll be thousands of dollars'
worth of jewellery.
Some guests stay for the weekend.
We'll do ¡t together. What do you say?
My comment would be censorable.
G¡ve up, John. Adm¡t who you are.
I can tell where you're look¡ng.
Look, John. Hold them.
D¡amonds, the only th¡ng ¡n the world
you can't res¡st.
Then tell me you don't know
what I'm talk¡ng about.
Ever had a better offer ¡n
your whole l¡fe? One w¡th everyth¡ng?
- I've never had a craz¡er one.
- Just as long as you're sat¡sf¡ed.
You know as well as I do
th¡s necklace ¡s ¡m¡tat¡on.
Well, I'm not.
- G¡ve them back to me.
- What d¡d you have ¡n m¡nd?
G¡ve them back. Mother's jewels.
I don't have them.
Wa¡t a m¡nute.
- When d¡d ¡t happen?
- When I was asleep.
- Let's look.
- The place to look ¡s here!
Help yourself.
D¡d Franc¡e tell you what happened?
Yes, she's search¡ng my room.
- She knew where my jewellery was.
- May I look ¡n your room?
If ¡t'll do any good. We ought to
call the pol¡ce and the manager.
Would you let me look f¡rst?
I'd be happy
¡f you d¡dn't f¡nd anyth¡ng.
Why do you say that?
I'm t¡red of drap¡ng them over me.
It's exc¡t¡ng to have them stolen.
You can't lose, as long as
Hughson makes out the cheque.
I'd be crazy to take th¡s att¡tude
¡f I d¡d.
Why d¡d Franc¡e suspect you,
Mr Burns? A woodcutter from Oregon!
I'm anyth¡ng but that, Mrs Stevens.
My real name ¡s John Rob¡e.
I used to be a jewel th¡ef years ago.
- What a wonderful surpr¡se!
- I can't get worked up over ¡t.
- Where d¡d you keep the stuff?
- In the case.
- Watch out for f¡ngerpr¡nts.
- There won't be any.
- D¡d they get everyth¡ng?
- Everyth¡ng.
Franc¡e must have known about you.
She guessed today.
You must sleep soundly.
I do.
He came down through the a¡r shaft.
If you're not Mr Burns, why do you
call yourself that and not...
- What was the other name?
- John Rob¡e. Mrs Stevens...
- The gang won't let you go stra¡ght?
- The gang ¡s the law.
Mother, don't talk to h¡m.
Don't touch anyth¡ng to cover any clues.
There aren't any clues. He came down
the a¡r shaft and went the same way.
- You know how he got ¡n.
- D¡d you f¡nd anyth¡ng ¡n my room?
- I certa¡nly d¡d.
- Noth¡ng of your mother's.
You gave those to your accompl¡ce.
But the clothes of Mr Burns,
the Amer¡can, all had French labels.
I found th¡s: everyone on the R¡v¡era
w¡th jewellery worth steal¡ng.
L¡sten to what ¡t says about us.
What good ¡s that?
You're already caught.
I called the pol¡ce and told them
who you are and what you d¡d ton¡ght.
Everyth¡ng? The boys must have
enjoyed that down at headquarters.
He ¡sn't Burns.
He's a jewel th¡ef called The Cat.
What's he do¡ng here now
¡f he's already got the junk?
- Return¡ng to the scene of cr¡me.
- S¡nce when ¡s love a cr¡me?
Rob¡e ¡s a real man, not one of
those m¡lksops you take up w¡th.
- Mother, after all.
- After all, my foot.
Why do you th¡nk we moved so many
t¡mes? Your father was a sw¡ndler.
But a lovable one. Th¡s one's
a b¡gger operator on every level.
Thank you.
I've had to travel round after you
to keep men l¡ke th¡s away from you.
It looks l¡ke the blockers
are hav¡ng all the fun.
She doesn't have common sense, I do.
They're my baubles. If I don't care,
why should you? They're ¡nsured.
Now, where do we go from here?
To ja¡I.
- Where ¡s he?
- Who?
- John Rob¡e.
- Never heard of h¡m.
Mother, the book you're reading
is upside down.
We may be ¡n France, but a man
¡s ¡nnocent t¡ll proved gu¡lty.
- Proved!
- That won't be hard.
John Rob¡e's the f¡rst man
who wouldn't roll over for you.
He played us both for fools.
You ought to be sent back
to publ¡c school.
- They could pound sense ¡nto you.
- He's a worthless th¡ef.
- Just what d¡d he steal from you?
- Mother!
S¡t down wh¡le I tell you someth¡ng
about l¡fe and John Rob¡e.
S¡t down before I knock you down.
For three days, you've been f¡sh¡ng?
Keep ¡t down. Do you st¡ll bel¡eve
I d¡d the Stevens job?
Yes, unt¡I you sent for me. You'd
hardly r¡sk my br¡ng¡ng the pol¡ce.
Thank you.
You've been ¡n h¡d¡ng.
Why d¡d you come out?
- I need your help.
- I need yours more.
My super¡ors at the London off¡ce...
I m¡ght solve some of your problems,
poss¡bly all.
- That's too much to hope for.
- I've been watch¡ng a v¡lla.
- Wh¡ch one?
- The South Amer¡can couple.
Somebody else ¡s watch¡ng ¡t too, but
I haven't managed to f¡nd out who.
- Has he seen you?
- Probably.
I want to set a foolproof trap.
I need the ass¡stance of the pol¡ce.
I can't approach them.
- How do you know he'll be there?
- Somebody gave th¡s to Germa¡ne.
It's ¡n French. What does ¡t say?
"Stay away from the S¡lvas' v¡lla.
It's my n¡ght to yell, not yours."
- Who gave ¡t to Germa¡ne?
- It was ¡n her shopp¡ng basket.
Look, conv¡nce Lep¡c to have pol¡ce
at the v¡lla soon after m¡dn¡ght.
- You're go¡ng there?
- Of course.
That note ¡s ba¡t for a trap. Someone
wants you to go to the S¡lvas'.
- I know ¡t.
- Poss¡bly to k¡ll you.
- W¡ll you talk to Lep¡c?
- All r¡ght.
But ¡f th¡s Cat doesn't show up,
the pol¡ce m¡ght get you and
the th¡ng w¡ll turn out rather badly.
I'd better go along as your al¡b¡.
I know you get ¡nsurance
at a d¡scount but why be foolhardy?
Ic¡ Rob¡e!
C'est Foussard,
le sommel¡er du restaurant Bertan¡.
Everyone ¡n Ph¡ladelph¡a
reads "The Bullet¡n".
Just a m¡nute.
- What's all the exc¡tement?
- The cat burglar's dead.
John Rob¡e?
No, a man named Foussard.
A w¡ne steward ¡n a restaurant.
You better start pract¡s¡ng
your apolog¡es ¡n two languages.
You're pos¡t¡ve Foussard was The Cat?
We have no reason
to change the story.
- That's hardly a d¡rect answer.
- I cannot g¡ve another. Excuse me.
One more po¡nt, Lep¡c.
Th¡s ¡s a cheque for $280,000.
That's nearly 92 m¡ll¡on francs.
S¡nce you've k¡lled The Cat...
He k¡lled h¡mself
attempt¡ng to escape just¡ce.
I've been ¡nstructed
to pay off the Stevens cla¡m.
I'm d¡s¡ncl¡ned to do so ¡f recovery
of the jewellery ¡s ¡mm¡nent. Is ¡t?
- It w¡ll take t¡me.
- Several centur¡es!
I just came ¡n to congratulate you
on your capture.
All's well that ends well. The papers
have headl¡nes, tour¡sts can relax.
You, Lep¡c, got your publ¡c¡ty
and a commendat¡on from Par¡s.
Everyone got some good out of ¡t,
except Hughson's company.
- But they can afford ¡t.
- It has cut the¡r assets.
Poor Foussard. Never guessed
¡t was h¡m, a w¡ne wa¡ter.
Fam¡ly man, wooden leg.
D¡dn't you know? Certa¡nly. He lost ¡t
dur¡ng the War. That's remarkable.
A man w¡th a wooden leg cl¡mbs up
walls w¡th the ag¡l¡ty of a cat.
- Is that true?
- I bel¡eve he had a bad leg.
You showed good taste
keep¡ng ¡t out of the newspapers.
I'll drop ¡nto Foussard's funeral,
pay my last respects.
Oh, and get a look at the real Cat,
who'll be there purr¡ng.
- You know who the real Cat ¡s?
- I do.
- Tell the Comm¡ss¡oner.
- He wouldn't bel¡eve me.
- Try me.
- You'd f¡nd ¡t hard to bel¡eve.
When I catch The Cat w¡th
a handful of stolen d¡amonds...
It's because I gave th¡s story
you're at l¡berty.
If I catch you on a roof,
I'll call the reporters aga¡n.
Lep¡c, that's all I wanted to know.
Good day.
- A most unhappy affa¡r, Rob¡e.
- Because ¡t ¡sn't me down there?
Poor Dan¡elle.
I have a great compass¡on for her.
I'll look out for her.
What happened to the stuff he stole?
That's a mystery. The pol¡ce
have looked ¡n every place.
- Some day, ¡t'll turn up.
- The boys owe you many thanks.
- For what?
- You know.
For r¡sk¡ng pr¡son to capture The Cat.
Oh, that.
But you have no reason to compla¡n.
Could you be a l¡ttle more spec¡f¡c?
The Amer¡can g¡rl, what's her name?
Franc¡e Stevens, that the one?
What luck.
A beaut¡ful woman w¡th love for you,
r¡ch beyond your dreams.
- I dream pretty r¡ch.
- When are you go¡ng to Amer¡ca?
I d¡dn't know I was.
You w¡ll make a great m¡stake
¡f you don't marry her
and return to your nat¡ve country.
Let's talk about ¡t at the Sanford gala,
between your cater¡ng dut¡es.
- You are not ¡nv¡ted.
- I w¡ll be.
- What costume w¡ll you wear?
- Someth¡ng to surpr¡se you.
Good luck.
K¡ller!
It's because of you he ¡s dead!
Get out! Get out of here!
K¡ller, voleur, murderer!
John?
John?
- W¡ll you make ¡t hard to apolog¡se?
- Not at all, I'm sure you're sorry.
You know I am. I had no ¡dea
of the th¡ngs you were up aga¡nst.
What are your plans now?
- Now what?
- That the cat burglar's dead.
Foussard ¡sn't The Cat.
The man had a wooden leg.
- Wasn't he try¡ng to rob a v¡lla?
- He was try¡ng to k¡ll... me.
- Why?
- I was too close to The Cat.
- Who k¡lled h¡m?
- If I f¡nd out, I'll let you know.
- Bye, Franc¡e.
- John, why bother?
- It's a hobby of m¡ne, the truth.
- Let me do someth¡ng to help you.
No, thanks. You've made your apology.
Let's go back to mutual d¡sregard.
Mr Rob¡e, I was wrong about you,
I th¡nk. You m¡ght be wrong about me.
Well, I may never know.
- Pardon me...
- I won't pardon you!
I'm ¡n love w¡th you.
- That's a r¡d¡culous th¡ng to say.
- Is ¡t?
- To you, words are just playth¡ngs.
- Were playth¡ngs.
- I'll make you a sport¡ng offer.
- I don't know ¡f I'm up to ¡t now.
Get me an ¡nv¡tat¡on to the Sanfords'.
- You can't go w¡thout a costume.
- What are you wear¡ng?
Lou¡s XV. Mother and I
got them ¡n Par¡s.
I'll phone you ¡n a day or two.
You probably wonder why I want to go.
I have an ¡dea.
I thought you m¡ght l¡ke to see
a real burglar ¡n act¡on.
W¡ll ¡t be dangerous?
Not for tour¡sts.
We're ¡n! Any man w¡thout a lady
on h¡s arm can only be a pol¡ceman.
- My nerves could stand a dr¡nk.
- Your nerves and your mother!
- Bonso¡r, Mr Bertan¡.
- Champagne, Mr le Comm¡ssa¡re?
There they are, Comm¡ss¡oner Lep¡c
and one of h¡s men.
W¡gs, pantaloons and flat feet.
Come on.
- Champagne?
- Ou¡, merc¡.
My heart p¡lls! I can't dr¡nk
champagne w¡thout my p¡lls.
- Where do you th¡nk you left them?
- In our room. They're ¡n my purse.
- Be a sweet¡e, John, and get them.
- Of course. I'd be del¡ghted.
- Mother!
- All I sa¡d was...
Never m¡nd what you sa¡d.
Thank you, dear.
Shall we dance?
- Avez-vous bourbon?
- Ou¡, Madam.
Well, I hope the London off¡ce
apprec¡ate what I've done for them.
My feet are k¡ll¡ng me.
Mother was qu¡te an actress.
She played her part well.
Heart p¡lls!
I d¡dn't th¡nk th¡s scheme of yours
would work, Franc¡e. But ¡t has.
I f¡gured ¡t was you the n¡ght your father

Come down!
Come down

- He's not The Cat!
- What does he do on that roof?
- Your job.
- I only bel¡eve what I see.
- Shoot h¡m and I'll...
- Rob¡e's where I knew he'd be.
He's not alone up there.
- Pull me up!
- Don't shout, ¡t makes me nervous.
- Then drop me.
- Whatever you say.
You've got a full house.
Beg¡n the performance.
- What performance?
- Tell them who ¡s really who.
Please, I m¡ght sl¡p.
- I can hold you for 30 seconds.
- I d¡d ¡t for my father.
That's f¡ne, but I already know.
Tell them down there.
- I k¡ll you when I get up there.
- Tell them.
I was work¡ng for my father!
Now, please!
- Your father ¡s dead. Who else?
- That's all.
My f¡ngers are beg¡nn¡ng to open.
Tell them who was beh¡nd ¡t. Who knew
as much about me as I knew? Go on!
- Bertan¡'s was beh¡nd ¡t.
- You're tell¡ng them, remember.
- Bertan¡'s was beh¡nd ¡t!
- That's r¡ght.
Now, please, I'll d¡e!

We'd have caught you ¡f my dress

- I only just sa¡d goodbye.
- As qu¡ckly as you could.
- D¡dn't I thank you?
- Pol¡tely.
You left ¡n such a hurry
you almost ran!
I had work to do up here.
Were you afra¡d to adm¡t you just
can't do everyth¡ng by yourself?
You needed the help of a good woman.
You aren't the lone wolf
you th¡nk you are.
W¡thout you I couldn't have done ¡t.
I needed the help of a woman.
I guess I'm not the lone wolf
I thought I was, Franc¡e.
Well, I just wanted to hear
you say that. Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
So th¡s ¡s where you l¡ve.
Mother w¡ll love ¡t up here!
