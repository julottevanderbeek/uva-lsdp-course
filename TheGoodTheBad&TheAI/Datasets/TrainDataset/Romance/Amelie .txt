-On September 3, 1973
at 6.28pm and 32 sec.
..a blue fly
of the Calliphorides species,..
..whose wings can flutter
..landed in Saint-Vincent Street,
Montmartre.
At the exact same second,
outside a restaurant,..
..the wind was sweeping in
under a tablecloth,..
..causing the glasses to dance
without anybody noticing it.
At the same time, on the fifth floor
of 28, avenue Trudaine,..
..Eugène Koler, erased the name
of his best friend, Émile Maginot,..
..in his adress-book
after coming home from his funeral.
Still at the same second,
a spermatozoon..
..containing an X-chromosome
and belonging to M. Raphaël Poulain..
..was reaching the ovum
of Mrs Poulain,..
..born Amandine Fouet.
..Amélie Poulain.
-Amélie's father was a former
army doctor,..
..and was working at the hydropathic
establishment of Enghien-les-Bains.
Raphaël Poulain doesn't like..
..peeing next to somebody else.
He doesn't like..
..noticing people laughing
at his sandals...
...coming out of the water with
his swimming suit sticking to his body
Raphaël Poulain likes..
..to tear big pieces of wallpaper
off the walls..
..to line up his shoes
and polish them with great care..
..to empty his toolbox,..
..clean it thoroughly,..
..and, finally, put everything away carefully.
Amélie's mother, Amandine Fouet,..
..was a Primary School teacher
from Gueugnon,..
..she had always been
unstable and nervy.
She doesn't like to have her fingers
all wrinkled by hot water.
She doesn't like it when
somebody she doesn't like..
..touches her,..
..to have the marks of the sheets
on her cheek in the morning.
She likes the outfits of
the ice-skaters on TV.
..to shine the flooring.
to empty her handbag..
..clean it thoroughly,..
..and, finally, putting everything away carefully.
Amélie is 6 years old.
She would like her father to hold her
in his arms from time to time.
But the only contact they have
is during the monthly medical check-up.
Moved by this intimacy,
the little girl..
..can't stop her heart
from beating wildly.
As a result,..
..her father believes she suffers
from a heart disease.
Because of this fictitious illness,
she doesn't go to school.
Her mother acts
as her private tutor.
-"The... chicken... often...
..hatch... in... the... convent."
-"The chicken..."
-Very good.
-hatch often.
-No !
-With no contact with
other children,..
..and mollycoddled by her parents,..
..Amélie's only refuge
is the world she makes up.
In that world, vinyls are made
the same way as pancakes,..
..and the neighbour's wife, who has been
in a coma for months,..
..just decided to do all
her sleeping at once.
-This way, I'll stay awake
night and day for the rest of my life.
-Amélie's only friend
is called "the Cachalot".
But the atmosphere at home turned it
into a neurasthenic and suicidal fish.
-Since these suicide-attempts
only increased her mother's stress,..
..a decision is taken...
-ENOUGH !!!
-In order to comfort Amélie,..
..her mother gives her
a second-hand Kodak.
-What have you done?
-A neighbour makes her believe that
her camera causes accidents to happen.
Since she's been taking pictures
all afternoon,..
..Amélie finds herself in deep worry
in the evening.
She collapses in front of the televison,
feeling guilty ..
..for a fire,..
..2 derailments
and the crash of a Boeing 747.
Later on, Amélie realizes
that the neighbour had made fun of her,..
..and decides to take her revenge.
-But, what the...
You be careful!
-and then, one day,
tragedy struck her.
Like every year, her mother
had taken her to church to lit a candle..
..so that Heaven would
send her a little brother.
The divine answer
came 3 minutes later
Alas, it wasn't a newborn
that fell out of the sky..
..but a tourist from Quebec,
determined to end her life.
Amandine Poulain, born Fouet,
is killed outright.
After her mother's death,..
..Amélie finds herself alone
with her father.
The latter withdraws into himself
even more.
He starts to build
a miniature mausoleum,..
..for the ashes of his beloved wife.
Days, months,
then years go by...
The outside world seems so dull..
..That Amélie prefers to dream her life
until she's old enough to leave.
in a bar in Montmartre,..
.."les Deux Moulins".
Today's 29 August,..
..in 48 hours, the destiny of
Amélie Poulain will take a different turn.
but right now, she has no idea
of what's going to happen.
For her, life goes on
with her collegues and the regulars.
This is Suzanne, the landlady.
She limps a little, but has
never spilled the slightest drop.
When she was young, she used to be
a horse-dancer. She likes..
..sportsmen who cry
from disappointment.
She doesn't like it when a man
is humiliated in front of his kid.
The tobacconist is Georgette,
the hypochondriac.
When it's not a migraine,
it's the sciatic nerve that's trapped.
She doesn't like to hear..
.."le fruit de vos entrailles
est béni."
This is Gina, Amélie's colleague,
granddaughter of a healer.
She likes to crack her fingers.
Here you can see her bringing a Kir
to Hipolito, the not-successful writer.
What he likes
is to see a bullfighter getting gored.
This is Joseph.
Gina's jealous ex-lover.
He spies on her
to see if she's replaced him.
The only thing he likes..
..is to pop the bubbles
of plastic wrappings.
And finally, there's Philomène,
the air hostess.
Amélie looks after her cat
when she's away. She likes..
..the sound of the bowl with water on the floor.
As for the cat,..
..he likes to listen to
children's stories.
-No thanks, ma'am,
I never work on Sundays.
-Amélie often goes to see her father,
during the WE, by train.
-Why don't you enjoy your retirement, and...
-Do what?
-Travel,
you never left Enghien.
-When we were young,
your mother and me,..
..we'd have liked to travel,
but we never could.
Because of your heart.
-Yes, I know.
-And now,...
Now...
-Sometimes, Amélie goes to the movies.
-I like to turn around in the dark
to see the faces of the people around.
And I also like to spot the little
detail nobody will ever see.
But I don't like it
when the driver doesn't watch the road.
-Amélie doesn't have a boyfriend.
She tried, but it didn't
live up to her expectations.
On the other hand, she enjoys
all sorts of little pleasures,..
..putting her hand
in a bag of seeds,..
..piercing the crust
of crème brûlée..
..with the tip of a spoon.
And play at ducks and drakes
on the Saint-Martin-canal.
-This is the cristal-man.
Because of an illness, his bones
break like cristal.
All his furniture is fleece-lined.
A hand shake is enough
to break his finger-bones,..
..so he never goes out.
Time hasn't changed anything. Amélie still
shelters in solitude..
..and asks herself silly questions
about the world or about this town.
For example, how many couples are
having an orgasm right now?
-Fifteen...
-And finally, the night of
This is what will change
the life of Amélie Poulain totally.
*-Good evening.
The Princess of Wales, Lady Di
died this afternoon in a car crash.
She was with her friend...
Only the first man to enter
the grave of Toutankhamon..
..may understand how
Amélie felt..
..when she discovered the treasure
that had been hid by a little boy.
On the 31st of August,
at 4 in the morning..
..Amélie suddenly has
a luminous idea.
She is going to find the owner
of this box..
..and return his treasure to him.
If he's moved, that's it, she'll
start to mingle with other people's lives.
If not, well, too bad.
-Oh, the young missie of the 5th floor.
We don't often see you.
-Excuse me. Did a little boy use to live
in my flat in the 50ies ?
-Come in
and have a drink.
-No, thanks.
-Yes, come in. Close the door.
Oh, kids...
I've known so many!
At first, they're cute, and then
they start throwing snowballs..
I know.
-How long have you been here?
-Since 64.
People must have told you.
-No.
Sit down.
My husband used to work
at Coccinelle Insurance.
People liked to say
he slept with his secretary.
They certainly did stop at
all the hotels in Batignolles...
And not the little ones.
'cause the bitch
would certainly spread her legs,..
..but only in satin cheets!
My husband started to steal
from his firm.
First only a little,
then 50 million at once.
And there they went! Flew away, both of 'em.
Drink !
So, on January 20 1970,..
..the doorbell rings. Well...
"Ma'am, your husband died
in a car crash in South America."
My life just stopped.
Black Lion died of sorrow.
Poor thing!
See how he still looks at his master..
..with love in his eyes.
I'll read his letters to you.
Don't move.
You can spare me 5 min, can't you?
There, he was in the army.
"Mado my love..."
My name is Madeleine.
"I can't sleep. I can't eat.
"I left my only reason
to live in Paris.
"I will see her again on friday 15,..
"..when I'll see my beloved weasel
at the station,..
"..in her blue dress with straps.
"
"Love."
There you are.
Have you ever received
letters like these?
-No. I'm nobody's
little weasel.
-My name is Madeleine Walace.
There's this saying: "Pleurer comme
une madeleine", isn't it?
-Yes.
-And Walace...
The Walace Fountains...
You see, tears
were my destiny!
For that business of yours...
Go and ask the grocer.
Collignon has always lived
in this building.
-Ah, good morning, Amélie-mélo !
A fig and 3 nuts,
as usual?
-The people who lived
in my flat, in the 50ies...
Do you remember them?
-Tough question!
I was 2 in the 50ies.
Just like this moron today.
-The moron is Lucien.
He's not a genius,..
..but Amélie likes him.
He holds the endives
as if they were precious,..
..'cause he likes a job well done.
-Come on, look at him!
It's as if he's picking up
a bird that's fallen from the nest!
You're lucky you
don't want grapes,..
..you'd have gotten it on Monday!
Come on, move, you retard!
The lady has other things to do!
Right.
Go and see my mother.
She's got
a memory like an elephant.
Mum-ephant!
-Thanks.
-Bredoteau.
-Excuse me ?
-That's the name you're looking for.
But it doesn't count if I say it,..
..I am senile.
-Don't listen to him,
he's senile.
Look at my oleanders!
-Why, what?
-Before the grocery,
he used to be a ticket puncher.
-What's wrong with that?!
-At night, he gets up..
..and punches my oleanders!
-I'd have preferred lilacs.
But that's life!
Everyone his way to calm down!
-With me, it's ducks and drakes!
- Ducks and drakes!
- There you are !
I write down everything.
-You write down what?
-Your son's almost 50.
And I still do his accounting!
-When he was 15, you still got his
toothbrush ready! That's the result!
-So, Camus, 2nd on the right...
-No, that's not it!
-No, staircase B,
that was Brossard...
That's it, I've got it!
Bredoteau, 5th on the right.
They were from the Pas-de-Calais.
-Bredoteau...
That's all I have to say!
-This young man who rummages
about under the photo machine..
..is called Nino Quincampoix.
Amélie was denied the company
of other children,..
..but little Nino,
would rather have done without.
Often, at the same moment,
..one was dreaming about a sister
and the other about a brother,..
..with whom they'd play
all the time.
-Hello, dad.
Made yourself a new friend?
-No, I've had it for ages.
But since your mother
hated it,..
..I had put it away in the shed.
Let's reconcile them with each other.
There! Not bad, eh?
-Say, dad.
If you found something from
your childhood, a treasure for you,..
..would it make you happy, sad,
nostalgic? How would you feel?
-I didn't have the dwarf
when I was a kid.
It was a present
when I retired.
-No, the things you keep a secret
as if it was of great value.
-I should varnish it
before the fall.
-I'm gonna make tea.
Do you want some?
-Don't move.
-You're OK? Better?
-Hey, close the door !
-It's not like Siberia.
-You're not allergic
to carbon monoxyde!
I coughed so much last night
that my pleural membrane almost broke!
-Yes, of course!
-What's the menu today?
-Endive "au gratin"
-They'll bring you to your knees.
-So they're good?
-Depends on where you fall...
True, if it's in the toilet..
-They're no good!
-12.15am, burst of laughter
reminiscent of an orgasm..
..to please the dominating male.
-I can't take it anymore.
-Yes, true.
Why does he insists?
There's other bars!
-Goodbye.
Mrs Suzanne !
-Yes ?
-Is there béchamel sauce,
in your endives?
-Of course, why?
-Béchamel sauce
doesn't agree with me.
Just like horse-meat for you.
-That's got nothing to do
with digestion, but with memories.
I'd rather eat
human flesh.
-Come on!
-Mrs Suzanne ?
Can I leave earlier today?
-What's his name?
-Dominique Bredoteau.
-Hello !
-Dominique Bredoteau ?
-Yes...
Can I help you?
-Well... It's for the petition.
-The petition ?
-Yes... The pétition... for...
For the canonization of Lady Di.
-O, yes. Er, no, thanks!
-Hello!
*-Yes?
Dominique Bredoteau ? It's for the census
of the European Union.
*-Come up. 3rd floor.
Hello, kitten.
Earl Grey ? Bergamot ? Jasmine ?
Can I offer you
something to drink?
-No. I have work to do.
-Yes, yes! Coming!
-Good afternoon, madam.
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau.
-Oh, my poor girl!
You've just missed him.
See, he's coming down.
-Bretodeau.
Not Bredoteau.
You look like you can use
some hot wine with cinnamon. Come in!
-I've lived here for five years now,
it's the 1st time bump into you.
-I never come out.
I don't want to meet
just anybody.
And there's only rascals out there!
But come in. There. Come in...
You know,
They call me the cristal man.
But my name
is Raymond Dufayel.
Amélie Poulain..
I'm a waitress...
-At the "Deux Moulins", I know.
And you're coming back empty-handed..
..from your hunt for Bretodeau.
Because it's not "do",
it's "to".
Like "toto".
-Thanks.
I really like this painting.
-It's "The rower's lunch".
By Renoir.
I paint one every year,
for 20 years now.
The hardest is the eyes.
Sometimes, they change
their moods on purpose,..
..when I'm not looking.
-They look happy here.
-They better be!
This year, they had
hare with morel..
..and waffles with jam
for the children.
Let's see, where did I put..
..that little note?
I see you're looking at
my camera at the window.
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.
Oh, I just put it there, this way..
..no need to wind up
my clock anymore.
After all these years,..
..the only character I
can't quite figure out,..
..is the girl with the glass of water.
She's in the middle..
..and yet, outside.
-Maybe she's just
different from the others.
-How different?
-I don't know.
-As a kid, maybe she didn't often
play with other children.
Maybe even never...
Here you are.
Dominique Bretodeau.
It's for you.
-This morning,
like every Tuesday,..
..Dominique Bretodeau goes out
to buy a chicken.
Usually, he cooks it in the oven
with baked potatoes.
After cutting off the legs,
the breast and the wings,..
..he'll clean up the bones
with his fingers,..
..starting with the oyster.
No, Bretodeau won't buy..
..a chicken today.
He won't go any further..
than that telephone booth.
There...
-In one second, Bretodeau
remembers everything.
Bahamontes' victory
in the Tour de France 1959...
Aunt Josette's corselets...
And, especially,
that tragic day..
..when he won all the marbles
of his classmates during playtime.
-Bretodeau !
-Bretodeau !!
The Claw, Bretodeau !
Does he know it, the claw?
-One cognac, please.
I can't believe,
what just happened to me.
It must've been my guardian angel.
Can't be anything else.
It's as if
the telephone booth was calling me..
..it rang, and rang...
-Well my,
there's the microwave calling!
-Can I have another cognac?
It's weird, life.
When you're a kid,
time creeps slowly and then one day,..
..you're 50.
And childhood,
whatever's left of it,..
..fits into
a little rusty box.
You don't have children
yet, do you,..
..miss?
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.
We haven't spoken to each
other for years now.
I heard she has a child,
a little boy.
His name is Lucas.
It's about time
I went to pay them a visit..
..before I end up in a box myself.
Don't you think?
-Amélie suddenly feels
in perfect harmony with herself.
everything's perfect:
the softness of the light,..
..that little scent in the air,
the peaceful sounds of the city...
Life seems so simple
and cristal-clear that she's swept..
..by this desire to help
the all mankind.
-I'll help you.
We go down and there we go!
There's the widow
of the drummer of the brass band.
Hey, the horse's lost one ear!
The husband of florist is laughing.
There's lollipops
in the shop window!
Can you smell his scent?
This man is offering melon
to his clients to taste.
There, they make
wonderful ice-cream!
We're passing
in front of the butcher's.
Ham on the bone costs 79 !
Here we're at the cheese merchant's...
At the butcher's,..
..a baby's looking at a dog,
that's looking at the chicken.
Here you are, now
we're at the metro station.
I'll leave you here, goodbye.
"She was never able to enter
into relationships with others..."
"As a kid, she was
always on her own."
*-On the evening of a bright
day in July,..
..while holiday-makers
enjoy themselves on the beach..
..in the carefreeness of the
sunny days and while in Paris,..
..the strollers, overcome by the heat
gaze at the trails of smoke..
..of the fireworks,..
..Amélie Poulain, also known
as "the godmother of the rejected",..
..or "the madonna of the cast-offs"
succumbs to exhaustion.
In the streets of Paris,
struck with grief,..
..millions of mourning anonyms
gather for the funeral cortège..
..to show in silence..
..their great sorrow
of being forever orphans.
What a strange fate,
that of this young woman..
..deprived of herself,..
..yet so sensitive to the charm
of the little things in life.
Like Don Quichotte,
she was determined to grapple..
..the unforgiving grinder
of all the human sorrows.
An impossible fight
that consumed..
..her life prematurely.
At 23, Amélie Poulain..
..let her life deteriorate
in the swirls of universal pain.
And there she was struck by the regret
of having let her father die,..
..without ever being able to give
back to this suffocated man..
..the breath of air
she'd been able to give..
..to so many others.
-Hey, Mister !
Hey, Mister !
Sir !!
Wait!
Wait!!
-Pages
full of failed identity photos..
..that their owners had
thrown away..
..and that had been re-assembled
and classified by some eccentric.
Some family-album!
-One Gauloises blondes.
-There's so much smoke.
Where are they?
I can't see anything.
-More to the left.
A bit further. There you are.
-There? Thanks.
Where are my 1F coins?
Never mind.
-Yes?
-One Moresque.
On Kir, one Moresque
and two and 2 peppermint cordials.
-That cooing, is it pre-nuptial
or post-coital ?
-And your bloody stupidity,
is it congenital?
-Pre-nuptial.
-Don't worry.
You'll find the right one in the end.
They all dream about sleeping
on a man's shoulder.
-I wouldn't mind,
but men snore.
I have a sensitive ear!
-I was operated, I got rid of it.
-How romantic !
-It's clear you've never known
true love.
-If I hadn't known it, they wouldn't
have shortened my right leg.
-Wasn't it a horse?
-Yes, precisely.
I was in love
with a trapeze artist.
I should've known, they dump you
at the last moment!
He dumped me
as I was going into the circus ring.
I was so upset,
and as a result, so was the horse.
Unfortunately, I was under it!
Right ! The Moresque.
-Love at first sight, it does exists.
-I'm not sayin' it doesn't.
But after 30 years behind the bar,..
..I can even give you the recipe!
Take two regulars, make them
believe they like each other,..
..let it simmer..
..works every time.
-Excuse me!
Excuse me!
-No !
-I'll go.
Don't you think you've done
enough harm already?
-Gina's old enough to
defend herself.
-I'm not thinking about Gina,
but about Georgette.
-Georgette ?
-Open your eyes !
She's hoping for you..
..and you're only looking at Gina !
Poor thing !
Look at all she's doing..
..to try and attract
your attention.
You're blind !
-I'm off, I have a date.
Bye!
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
I don't know
how the new one will be,..
..but'll never be worse than
that freak there with his tape recorder.
-Joseph's not really a freak.
He's hurting, that's all.
-It's been two months
since they broke up,..
..and he still shows up every day.
He likes to suffer !
-Don't tell me you
haven't noticed anything?
-What do you mean ?
-He always sits there?
-Well, yes.
-Sit down.
Sit down, Georgette.
What can you see, from here?
-My shop.
-And there's nothing missing?
-Well, no.
-Think harder.
-Well, no.
Really, I can't see!
-I'll let you think about it.
Good night.
Good morning...
"A Swiss octogenarian has received
a letter 30 years later.
"The mail was found by
mountaineers on the Mont-Blanc,..
"..in a bag
of the Malabar Princess,..
..a plane that crashed
at the end of the 60ies."
-What a pity !
Such a young and pretty princess...
-You mean, old and ugly,
that wouldn't have been that bad?
-Well, yes... Look at Mother Theresa.
And him?
Still after Gina ?
-No, after somebody else.
-Tell me,
is it someone I know ?
-Yes. It's funny,
that story about the mountaineers.
-Somebody from the Deux Moulins ?
Not you!
-No !
-Not Mme Suzanne...
No !
-Yes !
Look, he's there again.
-Yes... How strange.
-And here.
-"Still him."
Lyon Station.
-And here, again.
March 5, Austerlitz.
-And still the same expression.
Isn't it ? So neutral.
-12 times in total.
I counted.
It's strange, isn't it?
Why would he go across the whole
town to take photographs,..
..and then throw them away?
-Especially since they're
in perfect condition!
-Looks like some sort of ritual.
-Maybe he's obsessed..
..by the fear of getting old
and this is his way to relax.
-He's dead!
-Dead?
-He's afraid
of being forgotten.
He uses those machines
to remind the living of his face.
As if he were faxing
his image from the hereafter.
-A dead man who'd be
afraid of being forgotten...
Well, these ones don't
have to worry about that!
They died long time ago.
But they'll
never be forgotten.
You know,
that girl with the glass,..
..maybe she's thinking about someone.
-Somebody on the picture?
-No.
Rather a young man
she saw some place else.
She feels like they're
the same, the two of 'em.
-She prefers to imagine a relationship
with somebody who's away,..
..than to create bonds with..
..those who are there?
-No...
Maybe she's doing everything she can
to sort out other people's lives.
-But her ?
Her life,..
..who's going to take care of that?
-In the meantime,..
..it's better to devote yourself
to others than to a garden-dwarf.
-2,8 g of alcohol in his blood
for a chauffeur!
I'm not the only one to employ
an irresponsible moron.
-M. Collignon.
Your keys...
-Just a minute!
No rush!
Look at Lucien.
At work, there's no chance
he'll exceed the speed limits.  Is there?
-You shouldn't, M. Collignon.
It's not his fault.
-You're right.
It's not his fault,
it's Lady Di's fault !
Do you know
what I found this morning?..
..The 3 Suisses catalogue
open at the page with the nighties.
He'd stuck the picture of Lady Di
on the bodies of the models.
So, this time,
a bunch of asparagus,..
..or the neighbourhood records?
-Nothing.
"KEYS WHILE YOU WAIT"
-Thanks. Well, looks like those
migraines are gone.
-Yes, but I haven't slept all
night because of my sciatic nerve.
-You're looking good !
-Really ?
-A woman without love, it's
like a flower without sun. It dies.
-Strange weather today!
Did I say something wrong?
-No.
Everyone gives me the weather forecast.
-Talking about the weather
to forget that time goes by.
-No, to avoid talking nonsense.
-You can write nonsense,
but not publish it...
-Still nothing?
-30th rejection.
-What about your cousin, the critic?
-What do you think?
They're like the cactus..

-And your book ?
Is it a love-story ?
-No, it's about a guy
who keeps a diary.
But instead of writing it
as things happen,..
..he writes the worst-case scenario
beforehand.
As a result, he's depressed,
and he doesn't do anything.
-It's the story of a guy
who doesn't do anything.
-Look, Mme Suzanne,..
..I'll sign you the manuscript.
-Yes, and you forget
about his bill.
-I exchange his masterpieces
for my "pièces-de-résistance!"
-Here you are.
-Thanks.
-Thanks, Mme Suzanne.
-How long
did it take you?
Have you seen the time?
Jesus, this one,..
..they never got him finished!
