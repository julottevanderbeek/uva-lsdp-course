Hello.
Oh, yeah,
nice to see you.
Hey,
that dress needs
dry-cleaning.
Here you go.
Thank you kindly, Monica.
Monica? Monica?
Oh, shit, Hillary.
Okay.
Hi, Bill.
Oh, hey, Snow White.
Where is 11-B?
Bingo.
Where did she say
that thing was?
Guess it's time
for a little action.
Monica.
It's Bill.
I got some dictation for you,
Monica.
I got a big secret for you,
baby.
How did you get
up here so soon?
Monica. Monica.
- Hm?
Oh, wait, Monica!
Oh, I can't see!
My eyes! My eyes! I can't see!
WOMAN:
Who let you in?
Ah!
What happened? Where's Monica?
What happened to Monica?
How did you get in here?
She told me where the key was.
I can't see.
Did she say it was okay
to dry hump her roommate?
She said you'd be in the library
because you're a geek.
I am not a geek. Gosh.
Ah!
Oh, my God. What was that, Mace?
Oh...
Eternity by Calvin Klein.
Oh, I'm gonna be so careful who
I get in bed with from now on.
That'd be a big adjustment
for you, wouldn't it?
Ow. God.
Ow!
I do that every time.
I've invented a solution
for that. Seriously.
It's something that goes
around the coffee cup
so you don't
burn your hand.
I'm gonna call it the
coffee collar. Brilliant idea.
I know all about you.
I know your whole rap.
You do?
Yeah. You're a senior...
Uh-huh.
...who preys on freshmen.
You slept with half my floor.
Well, half your floor
was female.
Whatever.
And you once met Bono,
which I suspect
is total bullshit.
No, it's true. He signed my CD.
It's upstairs in my room
with my coffee collar
if you wanna see it.
Are you hitting on me?
No. I'm going off your look.
My look.
- Yeah.
Your "doggy bowl" look.
Are you calling me a dog?
No, it's a theory I have.
Oh, Casanova has a theory.
Yeah, when a girl's attracted
to a guy, she has a look.
It's her tell, like poker.
It's the same look a dog gets
right before
you put down the bowl.
You're offensive.
And you're crazy.
No, I'm honest. I believe
honesty is the best policy.
All right. You want me
to be honest with you?
Sure.
I'm majoring in Fine Art.
Right.
I'm studying the golden
proportions
of the human face.
And your nose is bent,
and it droops down at the bottom
a feature that's accentuated by
the thinness of your upper lip.
And your eyes
are too far apart,
but they'd have to be
to accommodate that bent nose.
And I feel sorry for you, that
you have to validate yourself
through insatiable,
meaningless, ego sport-sex
with insecure girls
like my roommate.
I would never have sex
with someone
like you.
Wow.
Wow.
Hey, come here.
That was amazing.
What was?
- The honesty.
That was almost better than sex
without the, uh,
without the crying.
Actually,
it did feel pretty good.
No one's been
that honest with me before.
It's called a friend.
I'm Tom, by the way.
Hannah.
Hannah. That's a palindrome.
Oh.
Good night.
- Uh...
good night.
Mwah.
Your hand's clammy.
- Oh.
I can see through
your nightgown.
Oh.
Tom, is that you?
Can I see your Bono autograph?
She's all yours, friend.
Hm.
Monica, get some sleep.
Who is this?
Oh, I'm late.
What are you doing tonight?
I don't do back-to-backs.
Isn't that what we were doing
last night?
No, that was
something different.
Back-to-backs
are seeing each other
two nights in a row,
and you know I don't do that.
Couldn't you just break
one of your stupid rules?
No.
- For me?
I'm sorry.
I don't break the rules.
I have a rule about that.
Mwah.
See you next week.
Thank you.
Oh, excuse me.
- Oh. Sorry.
Can I get a grande drip,
and a decaf, triple grande,
nonfat, extra-hot, stirred,
no-foam Caramel Macchiato,
with whipped cream,
extra caramel?
And fill that 70 percent
of the way.
Thank you.
Ooh, oh, here. Let me put
a coffee collar on that for you.
WOMAN: Oh, thank you.
I hear
the guy that invented that gets
a dime for each one used.
You're kidding.
- I am not.
That could add up.
Oh, I think I picked up
yours by accident.
Sorry about that.
- Oh, that's all right. Thank you.
Anytime.
Bye-bye.
"Gloria."
Morning.
Good morning, Hannah.
Coffee the way you like it.
Mm. Perfect timing.
I just finished
working on his balls.
That's a-- Yeah. Good.
Um, so I made a reservation.
HANNAH:
So, uh, which rule is this?
TOM:
No back-to-backs.
HANNAH:
Oh, isn't it the same
as the no-more-than-
once-a-week rule?
No, the once-a-week rule
works Monday to Friday--
Oh, so you could have a date
on Sunday and then Monday
without breaking it.
Exactly, you got it.
- Of course.
Ah, here we go.
Uh, hey, good morning.
Can I get the, uh,
steamed buns,
uh, the scalloped
steamed dumplings,
and the vegetarian
and shrimp steamed dumplings?
Thank you.
- For what?
You know how much
I love the fried stuff.
HANNAH:
You're looking after me.
Excellent.
So, what did she say?
Well, she was hurt,
but at least I was--
But you were honest,
weren't you?
What? I was. I am. Always.
I know you are,
but it's just shocking
how you use it as a shield.
Maybe I should lie.
Be more like Dennis Phillips.
Say whatever it takes
to get a woman in bed.
Do not be like Dennis Phillips.
He's so gross.
He only hit on you once.
At my father's funeral.
Okay, so he's not known
for his sensitivity.
Oh, God.
Anyways...
What?
Hm, nothing.
Oh. I know that "nothing."
It's not nothing.
It's something. Anyway...?
Anyway, we both know
you don't need to lie
to get a woman into bed.
Gloria. I don't wanna lose that.
- Mm-hm.
Can I keep it?
Thank you.
See, here's another rule too:
I can't call her
for another 24 hours.
Because then it appears
I'm too desperate.
Yeah, right.
You know,
Dan sent me another letter.
Asking you to move to Canada
and marry him again?
A slice
of apple-crumb pie.
TOM:
No. Got that last time.
I thought you guys broke up
a year ago.
HANNAH:
Nineteen months.
You're counting?
- No, he is.
It was in the letter.
- Uh-huh.
Lemon,
butter-cream cup.
Mm. Not feeling
the cream cup today.
Cranberry-orange muffin?
Oh, Hannah, come on.
You're losing it.
I know, I know. Okay, okay.
- They don't have it.
Forget about it.
Come on.
You're disappointing me. Ooh.
I got it. I got it.
Okay, I so have it,
I so have it.
Cream cheese-swirl brownie.
- Ooh.
You're so good.
What do you think
of this?
I think we should
bring them this.
Tom, I am not going to another
one of your father's weddings.
Thank you. Hannah? Please.
Take one of the girls
you've been rubbing against.
No weddings
or family events.
Oh, that's right.
I forgot that rule.
Leaves the wrong impression.
- It does.
TOM:
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Is this made
with real alligator?
Yes, baby alligator.
You should be
ashamed of yourself.
Oh. Look at you.
Hello, there. Hello, there.
Aren't you beautiful?
Oh, I love you.
Yes, I do. I love you.
You're so pretty. Yes, you are.
You're beautiful.
You're beautiful. You're so
beautiful. Look at that face.
Love you, love you,
love you, love you.
You should try saying that
to a human sometime.
What?
A human?
You don't say that to a human.
Mwah.
You're sweet. Love you.
Hannah, please.
- Come to the wedding.
No.
- He gets married and I go.
I go because he's my father
and I care deeply for the man.
And everybody knows
he doesn't love them.
They don't love him.
It's pathetic.
Breaks my heart.
I don't know what to say to him.
You know,
if someone's making a mistake
and it's not your place
to interfere, you say:
"I'm happy you're happy."
"I'm happy you're happy."
- Yeah.
Okay. I'll do that.
I promise you, this is the last
time I'll ask you to come.
And then I'll find somebody else
to come for the next few.
Hannah, please.
That's cute.
Last time.
Thank you. Thank you.
Look, she gets the apartment
in the city
and 30 grand a month.
Right. Okay, okay. You get
the house in the Hamptons.
She's asking for the apartment
and 30 grand a month.
Thirty? But--
Are you still
negotiating the prenup?
Now the party starts.
My son is here.
You're getting married
in 10 minutes.
Dad, Dad, please. I can't
breathe. Dad. Please, Dad.
Did you bring the lovely Hannah?
- Yes, I did.
You know, you don't act on that,
you know what I'm gonna do?
No.
- I'm gonna make her
my number six.
It's seven.
This is number six.
Yeah.
- My God, you are pretty.
Oh, Dad-- Oh--
- Mwah, mwah.
I used to be
that pretty once.
Dennis, look how pretty
my boy is.
Yeah, he's beautiful.
- They won't accept
a minimum of five times
a week.
She promised five,
I want five.
What did she promise
five times?
Four times?
- Two.
Two-- No, no, no.
We're not done yet.
We're not done yet.
Agree to three
with a bimonthly BJ.
Oh, this is disturbing.
Four, and make it weekly.
Wait, wait, wait. Don't--
Driver, go around the block.
We are not even close.
Hi.
- Hi.
What was that?
Christie, wait.
Christie.
Come on.
- Okay. Okay.
Come on, tell me.
Say what you gotta.
Well,
I'm happy if you're happy.
Oh."You're too old
for her, Dad.
"She doesn't love you.
This is embarrassing.
You're gonna rack up
your fifth divorce."
Sixth.
DENNIS: Sixth.
Come on,
I'm happy if you're happy.
Bullshit.
They'll go for four
if you exercise more.
She says you can't
gain any more weight.
Take it. Deal.
- Deal.
I told her I weighed
Ain't love grand?
Sign them both.
- What's he signing now?
Current prenup
and his last divorce papers.
Oh, that's just great.
WOMAN:
You look great, don't fix it.
Come on. You're good. Move.
I'm so excited.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- I'm so excited.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
Did you tell your dad
you loved him?
Ah, I told him
I cared for him.
You can't even tell your father.
Mm, I don't get that.
It's a guy thing.
- No, it's a Tom thing.
Oh, well,
you're an "I love you" slut.
Are you kidding me?
You say it all the time
to everybody.
HANNAH: Oh, this looks so good.
- There you go.
That looks good.
What is that?
TOM:
Ooh, lemon. Ooh, I should've
ordered this. This looks good.
You always order better
than I do.
BOTH:
Mm.
It's lemon, right?
- Mm.
It's good.
I'm ordering that from now on.
No, you won't.
- Why?
I need you to order
the chocolate cake
so I can have some.
There's my son.
Here we go.
Hi.
Christie. How are you?
Oh, if you're a bad boy,
I'm gonna spank you.
Oh, yeah. You know what I would
like to say to you?
Is that-- Ow.
CHRISTIE:
I want you to listen to me,
Tom.
- Yes.
If you need any monies...
Mm.
...or you need any advice...
- Right.
...or you got girl problems.
I don't think--
Uh-huh.
- I need you
to think of me
how you would a real mother.
TOM:
Yeah, that's exactly what I--
Look at this beauty.
- Oh, there he is.
Hello, sweetie.
- Hi.
Drunk as the night
I first met her.
HANNAH: So romantic.
- Oh, please. By all means.
You are a bad influence on her.
- Me?
Last shot, okay?
Mm-mm.
I'm stealing you away.
The last one?
He does know
that he can just date, right?
Um,
no, I don't think he does.
To mothers.
- To mothers. Cheers.
Ah, careful.
Oh, nice.
Oh, God.
Hide me.
- What?
It's my dad's
patient coordinator.
Yeah, don't look, don't look,
don't look. Don't look.
No, no. She's obsessed with me.
Yeah, she's created a website
called AllThingsTom.org.
The psycho blogger?
- Yes.
Okay, come on.
Dance with me. Watch yourself.
I think she's kind of cute.
- Oh, stop it.
I'm serious.
- Just keep going.
TOM:
Here, just--
Hide me. Up. Neck, neck, neck.
Up. Back. Side, side. Go. Over.
Her last blog was a two-page
description of my face.
You see, she doesn't think
my nose is too bent
or my lips are too thin.
Who said that?
- You did. When we met.
Well, I lied.
What?
I thought you were hot.
Ooh.
Well, you told me
I looked like a dog.
That's because I was just
trying to sleep with you.
Why haven't you since?
Well, I like having you
in my life.
Funny.
Hi, Tom.
- Oh, hi.
Did you see the new blog?
- Uh, no, we haven't.
Who's this?
- This?
Well, this is my--
My girlfriend.
Why didn't you tell me
you were seeing someone?
Because I don't know you.
- But we have a really,
really open relationship.
- Really?
I wanted to talk to you
about that, princess.
Princess?
- I--
I don't wanna be
with anybody but you.
I don't know if I'm really quite
ready to make that commitment.
Oh.
- You know my rules.
Oh...
We're a bit
of an emotional retard.
Yeah.
I think I need to start
a new blog now.
That is so scary.
- She's psychotic
on top of being--
- Oh, this is not good.
Get out of my way.
Hey!
Okay, good, she's gone.
Perfect. Let's go.
Oh, good, come on. What?
HANNAH:
Do you remember
that ancestral home in Scotland
with those paintings
I told you about?
Mm, it's all I think about.
Stop it, Tom.
I finally got the board
to sign off
on making them additions
to our permanent collection.
Really?
- Mm-hm.
But they want me
to go to Scotland
for an acquisitions trip.
When do you go?
Couple of days.
Couple of days?
For how long?
Six weeks.
- Oh.
That's a long time.
- Mm-hm.
That's great.
You think?
Yes, it's a great opportunity
for you.
You're like the museum maven
of the Met.
It's got a good ring to it.
Hm...
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Six Sundays. Hm.
That is six Sundays.
What am I gonna do
without you?
Oh, well,
I can just imagine.
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
I'm gonna jump!
- No. God. Jesus.
Six Sundays.
How can I live without you?
Can you not take
anything seriously?
Yeah, I can.
- Get down.
Let's get you
another drink.
I think I've had
too many already.
Oh, thanks for coming
to the wedding.
Oh, it was a ball.
I can't wait for number seven.
TOM:
It's coming up soon.
I have a feeling.
WOMAN :
Ah, I'm not gonna be able
to play today, man.
My back.
- Oh. If we don't have a fourth,
we're gonna end up
with Tiny Shorts Guy.
What's up? Need another?
- Hey, how's it going?
No, our friend Paul,
with longer shorts, is coming.
No, Ginny signed him up
for some art-walk thing.
- Art walk? Are you serious?
Tell me, what do you think
Ginny did with his balls?
Oh, come on, guys.
Marriage isn't that bad.
I agree. Without marriage,
there'd be no divorce,
and without divorce, I wouldn't
have my condo in Aspen.
There you go.
Good one.
What is he? What is he?
- I'm serious, man.
You're missing out
on the best parts of life.
The most important part of life.
This from the guy whose wife
won't let him own porn.
He's got to wank off
to the underwear section
of the Sears catalogue.
Hey, I thought we weren't
gonna talk about that, huh?
Whoa, whoa.
- What's the matter with you?
You are single and you've
been single ever since--
What was her name,
in sophomore year?
Uh...
- Plim--
Pimkin. Pimkin, that's it.
Pimkin dumped you
for him sophomore year.
You've never been the same.
You haven't been able to sleep.
Scarred.
FELIX:- Yeah.
You have no idea
how nice it is
to have someone who's gonna
be there for you,
no matter what, forever.
Snaps to that.
You don't know how nice it is
to sleep with a different girl
every night.
- That's true.
Nice rebuttal.
You know, you got the best
of both worlds, Tom.
No, it's true.
I can sleep with whoever I want
but I still get to hang with
Hannah. It's a perfect setup.
Well, maybe not for Hannah.
- What's that mean?
Come on, Tom.
She's a woman.
Yeah, I got that.
You sure?
- Yeah.
Dude, she's pushing 30.
You think her idea
of happily ever after
is coming home to you
and hanging out
after you got laid?
Makes you think, right?
Yeah.
Hello?
Hey.
How's the weather
in England?
It's great.
Only I'm in Scotland.
Oh, right. Right.
So it's sunny.
It's 3 in the morning.
Yeah.
Hey, have you seen
the Loch Ness monster yet?
Is there something important?
Yeah, you'll never guess
what happened.
They filled in the pothole.
The pothole?
Terrific. Hey, Tom?
Yeah?
Oh, okay. Sure.
Love you.
Call me tomorrow.
This stuff's all old.
Yeah. That's the point.
Let's go to Fendi.
Fendi? No. No, no.
- Yes.
We're here.
Let's just stay here.
I'm not into old stuff.
Why are you talking
like a 6-year-old?
I'm not.
This line is too long.
Can't we just go somewhere else?
No. This is the best bakery
in the world.
That's why
it's worth waiting in line.
Come on, we'll play a game.
Wanna play a game?
Yeah, we can play a game.
Okay, good.
Tell me what to order.
- Why?
You'll see. It'll be fun.
Make a suggestion.
A cookie.
No, no, you have to be specific.
Like, what type of cookie?
A really big cookie.
Tom, your phone's ringing.
Hello?
Hello?
Nope.
What's wrong?
Missed an important call.
That's because you're
an important person.
No. Oh-- Oh, wait.
- Hey, c-c-come to mama.
Uh, we will have, um,
two fried dumplings
two of the wontons and six of
the, um, fried porky thingies.
Yeah, but that's fried.
Oh, come on.
- It's not healthy.
Have some of the fried.
It won't hurt you.
Thank you.
Move, please.
Oh, gosh.
This is unbelievable.
Hello?
Hey. Hello?
Hannah?
- Hey.
Tom? Tom, is that you?
- Hello?
Ugh-- Hello?
Tom? I'm stuck
in a thunderstorm.
I'm surrounded
with a herd of cows.
I'll call when I get
to the hotel.
Tom?
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Oh, I hate Scotland.
WOMAN:
We're having a hard time.
MAN:
We're having a hard time.
Oh, yeah? Want a hand?
Can you give us
a little...?
Yeah.
- We'd love it.
All right. I think
you'd better sit down, sir.
I might fall in.
- Sit down there, sir.
Sit, sit, sit.
- Here we go.
Oh, don't come in.
Hang on.
- Thank you, thank you.
Have a good afternoon.
WOMAN:- Have a wonderful day.
Here we go.
Come on, scrub.
- Watch out.
Let's go.
What do you got, Gare?
What do you got, Gare?
What do you got?
FELIX: Come on, Tom.
What do you got?
Easy.
Tom, foul.
That's a foul, Tom.
What's the matter
with you today?
I don't know. I think I might
have feelings for Hannah.
Oh, come on, come on.
- Let's just play.
It's just...
without her, something's off,
and it's got me thinking
that maybe there's more to life
than just sleeping around.
I don't understand.
I-- I'm not following.
Come on, let's just play.
Come on. I'll take it out.
I know exactly
what you mean, Tom.
Thanks. Here you go.
I'm gonna tell Hannah.
When she gets home I'm gonna
tell her I want to be with her.
Nothing about marriage,
just together.
Yeah, that's romantic.
ANSWERING MACHINE:
HANNAH :
EL PRESIDENTE:
All right.
Okay.
Have a good night.
Ah!
Tom. You okay?
I'm all right.
Are you all right?
I think I broke a rib.
His rib. I'm fine. I'm okay.
WOMAN: Sorry about your flowers.
Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry. What?
WOMAN:
Sorry. Here are your flowers.
Oh, but-- But--
Flowers?
No, they're not my flowers.
Your flowers. Those are yours.
- I didn't have flowers.
Hi. It's good to see you.
I missed you.
- It's great.
Come here. There's someone
I want you to meet.
Oh, good.
HANNAH:
It started pouring,
and suddenly it was just me
in a field of cows.
And of course, we're in Europe,
so there are no street signs
and it's getting dark.
I think she thought she
was in some bad werewolf movie.
Stay off the moors, lassie.
So anyway,
all of a sudden out of nowhere,
Colin comes riding up
on horseback--
- Oh.
Can you believe it? A horse.
--and asks me
if I need any help.
Wow.
You were a lady in distress.
What was I gonna do?
It was right out
of a Bronte novel.
So anyway, he shows me
to this charming little inn
where he proceeds
to buy me the most awful dinner
I have ever had.
Right. Okay. Aye.
It was pretty bad,
even by Scottish standards.
Then we just spent
the next month
traveling around the country
getting to know each other,
visiting museums. It was--
BOTH:
It was perfect.
So when it was time
for Hannah to leave, I just--
I don't know, I just--
I couldn't let her go.
So I got down on one knee--
And he proposed, and I accepted.
Wow, that's just--
It's huge, it's--
So the wedding's
coming together quickly.
Oh, it sounds like it.
- We're gonna get married
at Colin's parents' summer home.
It's gonna be small affair.
We can't expect too many people
to make the trip overseas
in just a fortnight.
A fortnight?
Aye.
That's two weeks.
It's crazy, isn't it?
You ever been to Scotland, Tom?
- You know, I haven't.
You should see
where we're exchanging vows.
It's the same church that
Colin's parents were married in.
It's pretty spectacular.
It's across the loch
from our distillery.
- Distillery?
Yeah. Colin's family owns
the largest whiskey distillery
in Scotland.
Oh.
Tom, look,
if you were getting married,
I'd expect to be your best man.
Tom, will you be
my maid of honor?
Your maid of honor?
Oh!
TOM:
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Forgive me, I--
What is it with you?
- What? I didn't--
What are you--? Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Did you see that?
Maid of honor.
That's funny stuff.
But you're a guy.
Go ahead, just get it out.
Oh, my--
So-- So, what did you say?
Did you say yes?
- No.
No?
I didn't know what to say.
I told her I'd think about it.
Think about whether that dress
is gonna make your ass look big.
Give me a break. Come on.
Okay. All right,
let me think.
She really into this guy?
Oh, you should have seen her.
Staring at him all moony,
like he shits unicorns.
Oh, that's not good, man.
You're gonna have to do this.
You're gonna have
to be the maid of honor.
What?
- Yeah. I'm serious.
Think. This would give you
an excuse
to be around Hannah
all the time.
Helping her out, being the man
behind the curtain. Huh?
You'd be her confidant.
And then you could use that time
to point out to Hannah
that this is really crazy
and that she doesn't
even know this guy at all.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
No way.
What? Look.
- No.
I don't know
what your other options are.
You've got a better chance
of stopping this wedding
from inside
than from another continent.
And they say
that you can shorten this
and wear it again
if you like.
Come on, if you're serious
and you really want Hannah back
from this guy, you're gonna
have to do whatever it takes.
Whatever.
Your dress is beautiful.
Thank you.
I am so happy
you're gonna do this.
Pleasure. For this wedding,
I am willing
to do whatever it takes.
Oh, I'm so excited.
- Yeah, me too.
All right, so let me tell you
who the bridesmaids are.
Okay.
- Stephanie.
Great. I like Stephanie.
- And she loves you.
Oh, good.
- And my friend Hilary.
I don't know Hilary. Okay.
- She's the best.
And Melissa.
Oh, no.
- I had to, Tom.
She's my cousin.
- She hates me.
Well, you broke her heart.
She broke my nose.
That was an accident.
- She hit me with her fist.
I was completely
honest with her.
I said, "Look, nothing serious,"
and she agreed.
So sometimes our hearts
don't match our mouths.
Oh, that's good.
Put that in the vows.
She's wanted to be my maid of
honor since we were 5 years old,
so now she's really
gonna hate you.
There they are now.
Okay, well,
as your maid of honor,
I promise to keep the peace.
- Good.
Oh, hi.
Hello, good to see you.
- Yes.
Oh, the bride-to-be.
- Hello. I'm Tom.
I'm Hilary.
- Very nice to meet you.
Hi.
- Stephanie, how are you doing?
Good to see you.
- It's so good to see you too.
Are you kidding me?
And look at you, Melissa.
- How have you been?
That went great.
- This isn't awkward.
It's gonna be fine. Don't worry.
I'm gonna be fine.
WOMAN:
Oh!
STEPHANIE:
So, Tom, have you met Colin yet?
TOM:
Yes.
Oh, isn't he dreamy?
Absolutely.
Could someone please
pass me the Splenda?
Could someone
who's not a misogynist
pass the Splenda?
Hello?
Thank you, Stephanie.
It's Colin, you guys.
ALL:
Aw!
Hi, babe. One sec.
Hi.
They're so cute.
- Oh.
We have nine days before we
leave. We have to act quickly.
Exactly. I've been
a MOH six times,
so I'll organize everything
that needs to be done.
Even though I'm not officially
the MOH here.
What is a MOH?
M-O-H.
Oh, maid of honor.
Oh, that's clever. Yeah.
- That's you.
No, it's going great.
Very smoothly.
So we've got the bridal shower,
the bachelorette
dress fittings, the kilt--
I'll do the kilts.
STEPHANIE: Perfect.
- Oh, good.
Shopping for Hannah's trousseau.
STEPHANIE:
That's great.
Trousseau?
- What is a trousseau?
It's lingerie.
Oh.
- For her wedding night.
How do you expect
to be a good MOH
if you don't know that?
She's talking to me.
No, I didn't.
You just did.
Oh, I'm sorry, Tom.
Did I break a rule?
Oh, um-- How about we focus
on the wedding part?
Good idea. Let's do that.
Just for now.
Okay. I need dress sizes.
I'm a 4.
Okay.
- Eight.
I'm sorry.
You know, Hilary, uh,
do you think that maybe you'd
just be more comfortable in,
like, a 12?
No, it'll be fine.
I'm doing the Dr. Riverbed fast.
Oh, yeah.
What is that?
Uh, water, peach resin,
apple pectin
shark extract,
Lawry's seasoning salt.
What about food?
Look, I am going to look amazing
in that dress,
I am going
to meet a Scottish man
and I'm gonna be happy.
Write down an 8.
Got it.
What's your dress size,
maid of honor?
I don't know.
What's your jock size, Melissa?
Okay, guys. That's enough.
- It's enough.
Sorry. But will you guys
look at Hannah, please?
Okay, she's happy, finally.
So could you please,
for Hannah,
let's all just get along,
hook a smile on our faces
and pretend like everything
is perfect.
Okay, fine. Okay.
Oh, you're back. That's great.
What did he say?
How's he doing?
- Oh, he's so sweet.
ALL:
Aw!
Oh, isn't that great.
How's it going?
HILARY: Great.
- Good. Really good.
Oh, wow.
- Fantastic, so fantastic.
I mean, it is
pretty much done.
Perfect.
- Really?
Tom?
- Yes.
Here.
- What is this?
Uh, she does bridal shower
entertainment.
I hired her for Stephanie's
sister's shower
and Hannah loved it.
She reads tarot cards
and stuff.
Oh, that's great. Thank you.
I'm not doing it for you,
I'm doing it for Hannah.
Okay. Thank you.
For Hannah.
It should've been me.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye, Tom.
Goodbye.
- Bye, Hilary.
See you.
Nice meeting you.
HILARY:
You too. Bye.
I just had a very nice
bonding moment with Melissa.
Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure.
My mother and grandmother
are coming into town tomorrow
and I have so much to plan.
I was wondering if you
and your boys
could entertain Colin
for the day.
Entertain him?
- Get to know him and stuff.
Sure.
Cool.
- Yeah.
So are you more proud
of Scotch tape
or McDonald's?
I think they're both American.
So wait, you invited this guy
to play ball with us?
Yeah. He's the competition.
I need to get to know
his strengths and weaknesses.
DENNIS:
I like his green shirt.
Is that, like,
a poly-blend kind of thing?
TOM: It's my shirt.
DENNIS: It's yours?
Yeah. Looks good on him, huh?
Yeah. Looks real good.
- Why don't you play with him.
Thanks.
Hey, Colin, you ever play
basketball before?
We would call this netball.
Um, back in Scotland it's more
of a woman's game.
So no, I don't have
much experience.
I do. You need one more?
We're good.
- All right.
All right, girls. You ready?
FELIX: Yeah. I am.
Good. Gotta use
your hands there.
GARY:
You all right there?
DENNIS:
I'm open, I'm open.
There we go.
FELIX:
Gotta hold on to the ball, man.
Gotta hold on to the ball.
Almost. Almost.
You should get
some Scottish girls out here.
No, you want to start again
because you didn't get that.
There you go.
There you go. That was good.
Here you go.
FELIX:
What do you got?
Shoot that. Nice.
TOM: I like it like that.
Sorry, guys.
DENNIS:
Get on him.
TOM: Lay-up. Hey,
get in there, ball.
You okay?
DENNIS: Okay, back to you.
Put it in the basket.
Put it in the basket.
Jeez.
You know what I'm learning?
The guy's a chump.
Yeah.
TOM: There it is.
FELIX:
Arms up, baby. That's good.
That's it, that's it.
We got it now.
Hey, I look good, don't I?
Here we go. Here we go.
DENNIS:
Yo.
Just put it in the basket.
Go ahead.
Put it in the basket.
FELIX:
Hey, take a shot.
COLIN: Sorry, guys.
DENNIS: You see that?
Probably not allowed
to stuff it in.
He dunks the ball.
- Sorry, sorry.
He dunks the ball.
That was awesome.
You can dunk.
He can dunk.
That is awesome.
Wait, if that's allowed,
why don't you guys all do it?
Yeah, if we could,
we would. Right?
Nice.
Yeah!
Oh!
Score.
Oh! Ooh!
DENNIS: Yes!
Good game, yeah.
Good game.
MAN:
Ow, my brother.
Looks like he's gonna be more
competition than you thought.
I know, I know.
GARY:
I love this guy.
Hey.
Uh...
Hm...
Whoa.
- Oh, shit.
Whoa.
You all right?
FELIX: Yeah.
Hey.
Holy...
That boy's got mad-cow disease.
We gotta get dirt on him.
I got a guy I use
when a spouse suspects
infidelity.
Everybody's got skeletons
in their closet.
Nobody is squeaky clean,
and my guy is the best.
I don't know.
It just seems so cheap.
It won't be. I'll charge double
because you're rich.
I mean,
it's a cheap thing to do.
He plays cheap.
You gotta match that.
How does Colin play cheap?
That whole thing with Hannah,
being Scottish,
making her fall in love
with him in Scotland.
That monster thing of his.
Fine. Get the dirt.
That's cool.
WOMAN :
What's he gonna do,
eat her?
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, take a breath,
take a breath, take a--
Thanks, Tom.
Yeah, have a great flight.
Bye. Thanks, mate.
Oh, come on. Jesus.
I love you, Colin.
Bye.
Bye. Ooh!
Yeah. Mm.
Oh, God.
Need some ChapStick?
- Yeah.
So, what church
are we going to?
HANNAH:
Grace Church.
Thank you so much for coming
with me to meet the reverend.
Oh, it's no problem.
- He is the sweetest man.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
He married my parents
and insisted
on coming to Scotland
to do my wedding.
Why didn't Colin
stay and do this with you?
Well, it was more important
for him to go back to Scotland
to petition the Grand Council
so Colin
and I could get married.
I don't-- What's a Gran--?
What's that mean?
I'm not Scottish, and his family
is kind of like, you know...
What?
...royalty.
Royalty?
- Mm-hm.
Royalty? What is he,
like a king?
No, no. He's a duke.
Oh.
A duke!
Ah, Hannah, darling.
Reverend Foote.
And this must be
the lucky young man
who's marrying
our beautiful Hannah.
Oh, no.
- No.
I'm not marrying him.
- No.
This is Tom,
my maid of honor.
- Mm-hm.
Maid of honor?
- Yes.
Well, how about that?
We have many gay and lesbian
members of the congregation.
Welcome.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Reverend.
So let's talk
about the wedding.
Okay.
I need to get some details
about you and, uh...
Colin.
...Colin. Colin, yes, uh,
I want to work it
into the ceremony.
Okay. Well, it was such
a whirlwind, really.
Yes, well, enlighten me.
Tell me about it.
Hannah, darling.
Hannah, I think it's important
to dig deep here for the vows
and tell Reverend Foote
all you know about Colin.
All that you love about him.
Okay.
And not just the obvious stuff,
but those unique characteristics
that are Colin.
Those things
that make you laugh and say:
"That's so Colin."
Right.
And then, you know,
maybe you could, uh,
get some information from Colin
and emphasize their unique bond.
Their shared history.
Of course.
We could talk about
love at first sight.
Well, that's always
a crowd pleaser, but, uh--
Hannah, elaborate.
Tell me more about him.
How you feel about him.
FOOTE:
Where did you meet?
HANNAH: In Scotland--
Modigliani.
Your first summer in New York
you were dating a guy
who worked on Wall Street
and he asked you to move in,
and you weren't sure.
That was right around the time
you discovered Modigliani.
You became obsessed
with his painting
of this woman who had
a blue scarf on, holding a baby.
And Hannah said,
"That painting captured
the essence of that woman
better than any photograph."
I can't believe
you can remember that.
I also remember that she freaked
because she said she felt
more passionate
about that painting
than she did
about Mr. Wall Street
and she wondered if she
could ever meet somebody
that could make her feel as
passionate as that work of art.
FOOTE:
That's good.
That's good.
Modigliani.
Now I know why you picked him
to be maid of honor. Yes.
Well...
Come on.
Who's ready to lose
some money tonight?
Because I'm feeling lucky.
You guys are late.
How you doing?
FELIX: How you holding up?
TOM: Stressed.
What the hell is this?
Hannah's shower's
in the morning.
Well,
where we gonna play?
We're not gonna play
until these baskets
and everything else gets done.
What about this party mix?
- Mm-hm.
That's potpourri.
Oh, this is perfect.
Felix, take it off.
Deb has one of these.
It's funny,
you can't see a thing.
GARY: She'd have to, with you.
- Take this.
You could be,
like, blinded.
I'm not playing with baskets.
It's poker night.
TOM:
You put bayberry with serenity.
You no like?
- No, it's interesting.
Thought it was obvious bayberry
worked best with harmony.
Really? I've been putting
bayberry with Tahitian sunrise.
Ooh.
That, I like.
That's Zen.
Yeah. You know
what I like?
I like how you put
the bath ball in the center.
I like that so much,
I'm gonna see your ball
and raise you another ball.
Good idea.
You should have two balls.
FELIX: Get you another ball.
Hey, Dennis,
come and curl some ribbon.
I can feel my sperm dying
inside of me one at a time.
Shut up and grab a basket.
Come on, it's fun.
I'm going to a strip club
to eat some meat.
Then I'm gonna
get into a fight.
Call me when you find
your balls, Tom.
All right, tough guy.
Or maybe they're in the basket
next to the Tahitian sunrise.
Someone's afraid
of his feminine side.
TOM:
Look at that-- Oh, nice job
with the fluffing.
Look at that, huh?
- You tjuzsed it,
and it's been tjuzsed, and--
Look at us.
- Come on.
Nice work, huh?
- You can't lose.
TOM :
Oh, shit.
Oh, hello, ladies.
You look lovely today.
HILARY: Tom.
Ah, Hilary, how are you?
Good.
Everything looks wonderful.
This is the best shower
I've ever been to.
Really, you think so?
You know what, Hilary?
You should really
eat something.
No. Tom, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm okay.
Oh, what you ladies go through
to fit into a dress.
Hey, this pretty much blows
your rule out of the water
about no women allowed
at your place, huh?
What good's a rule
if you don't break it?
I'm very, very impressed.
Huh? Listen to that.
Gay Gordons party remix,
just for you.
Hear the horn?
Hear the horn?
It's good, isn't it?
No--
- Here, let me turn it up for you.
There.
It's a little loud.
- What?
It's a little loud.
- Right. I'll turn it down.
There. Look, try this.
Haggis pink.
It's pepper, cheese,
chopped-up baby lamb lung
and cow pituitary gland.
It's a Scottish delicacy.
Colin recommended it.
Hm.
Ladies. Ladies.
Look what just came for Hannah.
It's from Colin,
everyone.
Oh.
STEPHANIE:
Wait, there's a card.
There's a card. There's a card.
It says "Hannah."
"Hannah, my love,
this is the extremely rare
Scottish floral bud thistle."
Thistle?
"They only bloom for four hours
before they die."
He must have timed
this out perfectly.
HANNAH:
Oh, my gosh. When we first met,
Colin joked that he would
roam the countryside
to find me one,
and he did.
ALL:
Aw!
Sweetheart, that's the most
romantic thing I've ever heard.
Thanks, Mom.
Joan, good to see you.
It's been too long.
I think, uh,
Easter, wasn't it?
Yes. You slept
with our maid.
She told you?
I didn't know
she spoke English.
Yes, huh?
- This is Grandma Pearl.
You remember Tom.
- Of course.
How are you?
- Oh, yes.
Uh, the fornicator.
That's right.
Okay.
- Tom, this is awesome.
It's great.
- Good, thank you.
This is even better
than my sister's shower.
Really?
It appears
to be going well. Yes?
Sharon would like to know
where to set up.
Who?
- Uh, the entertainment.
Ah, yes. Thank God--
I mean, good.
Uh, she-- Uh, she should set up
over there.
Hello, everybody.
Hi, I'm Sharon.
Good to see you all.
Yeah, come on,
right down in front.
TOM:
This was my idea, you know.
Oh, I know you loved her
from Stephanie's
sister's shower--
SHARON: I'd like for us all
to take in a deep breath.
She wasn't at the shower.
She wasn't?
- No.
And now exhale slowly.
- Really?
SHARON: Good job. Good job.
It's very important to
reset our third eye, right?
And connect
to the primal...
Ooh.
...inside of ourselves
before I present
the pleasure aids.
Pleasure aids?
Now...
...these pleasure aids
are best used
when in a tantric,
meditative state.
And today,
I'm going to show you ladies
how to reach your optimal,
sacral chakra.
All of these aids
are for sale, ladies.
And-- Oh, look
what we have here.
We have edible panties.
You look hungry.
Here, snack on these.
There you go.
Now, ladies, what pleasure party
would be complete without
glow-in-the-dark thunder beads?
These are terrific.
And for you ladies today,
two for one.
Okay? There you go.
You wanna try
those out, princess?
W-where do these go?
SHARON:
From casual
right into evening wear.
Gorgeous.
You know what,
why don't you keep those.
Oh, and they match
your earrings.
Hannah, you okay?
You know that I dreamt
of my wedding shower
ever since
I was 10 years old?
No.
Strangely enough,
the image of my Grandma Pearl
draped in glow-in-the-dark
thunder beads,
wasn't a part of it.
It's not funny, Tom.
Uh--
Do you have any idea
how important this is to me?
And the Gay Gordons,
pink haggis,
dildo saleswoman?
W-- Just understand something,
that Melissa set me up.
Oh, please. There's always
an excuse with you.
I never even should've asked you
to do this in the first place.
You don't even believe
in marriage.
You know, I might.
I gotta get back.
Whoa, Melissa's pretty good.
TOM :
that she doesn't know anything
about Colin.
That I'm the right man
for her.
That did not happen.
Oh, Stella. No.
No, baby,
don't eat buttons, okay?
Yeah, but you're still
the maid of honor, right, Tom?
I think she might have fired me.
How does somebody get fired
from being maid of honor?
Tell me about it.
You know what? I got an idea.
Okay.
Right.
DENNIS: I'm at a loss,
completely stunned.
My guy couldn't find
any dirt on Colin.
This has never happened.
This guy's clean.
I'm glad it happened to me.
You know he's got
three Guinness records?
Cool. For what?
He's actually got
a Medal of Honor.
Hey, that's pretty funny,
because we got the maid
of honor right here.
ALL :
Hey! Oh!
Hey.
All right, let's stay focused.
The point is, we're not gonna
get her off this guy.
Yeah, so we need to
not make this about Colin.
We need to make it about you.
Good.
Show her that you're growing up,
that you're changing.
I am changing.
I'm growing up.
Good. Then this
should be easy for you.
Okay, great.
These are bridal magazines
from 18 different countries,
each with a feature article
on being a maid of honor.
- That's not bad.
GARY:
Now, I got guys in Bangalore
that we outsource to.
They translated them
overnight for you.
Nice appetizer there, Gary.
Here's the main course.
TOM:
What you got? Bring it.
My wife, Deb,
is an A-type personality.
She has to do
everything perfect.
Sure.
- Love her. Hate that about her.
Right.
- Anyway, she rented this
when she was gonna be
the maid of honor
for her yoga teacher.
This is the goods.
TOM: Let's look.
FELIX: You'll be wowed.
Okay, what's the length
of the bridesmaid's dress?
Can't be longer than bride's.
What if someone
won't be able to attend?
You gotta send
an invitation anyway.
Receiving line?
Receiving line?
If there's a receiving line,
that means I've failed,
because Hannah's married.
DENNIS:
Right. It was a trick question.
Who was the runner-up MVP, 1974?
No, hey-- These questions
all have to do
with Tom being the best
maid of honor he can be.
All right, uh...
I thought we were just asking,
like, questions.
Go sit down.
Basic duties
of the maid of honor?
Manage the bridesmaids,
hold the ring,
support the bride.
Basic duties as you
as the maid of honor?
Show that I've matured,
that I can take care
of my responsibilities fully
and that I need to destroy
the wedding from within.
What happens if you fail
at that task?
Colin gets her.
What are we gonna do?
Steal the bride.
What are we gonna do?
Steal the bride.
What are we gonna do?
Steal the bride.
ALL:
Steal the bride.
And remember, whether it's
helping with the seating chart
or giving an opinion
on the cake,
You know, you didn't have to
clear your day to do all this.
Are you kidding?
Of course I did.
The perfect maid of honor
is with his bride
every step of the way.
A changed man.
I am, indeed.
Wow, I don't even know
where to begin.
Now, when choosing
your china patterns,
you need to think about
what entertaining you wanna do,
what sort of foods
you wanna cook.
Ah, here, look.
Now, don't be afraid
to mix and match.
It's important, even with
different styles and textures.
What you wanna do
is stir up the table.
Make it come alive
with color and finesse.
That is the goal.
Also, at the end of the day,
you will find...
connections.
Ah, thank you very much.
Let's go.
If you think I'm good
with plates,
wait till linens.
Lingerie, perfect.
What about the linens?
Help pick something
for the wedding night.
No.
- Are you crazy?
You're the perfect person
for this job.
Who's taken off
more lingerie than you?
Let's put your whoring
to good use.
Good point.
So how did it go
with the Scottish Grand Council?
HANNAH:
Oh, great.
Colin got them
to approve everything.
Great.
So I gotta tell you,
I know this is gonna
sound funny
but, um,
I have to thank you.
For what?
Well, for asking me
to be your maid of honor.
Yeah. I-- I know this
is gonna sound crazy,
but you've really opened my eyes
to the whole idea of marriage.
Right.
No, seriously.
Have you met someone, Tom?
No.
Well, then how
can you be serious?
I don't know. I just...
I don't know.
Hm.
What do you think?
You think Colin will like it?
No. No.
It's just--
- What?
It's cute.
Ah!
- Cute?
I do not wanna look cute
on my wedding night.
Just put this on.
Cover yourself up.
Oh, hey.
That's my coat.
Thank you. Yeah.
Thank you.
TOM:
Here, let me get you in a cab.
Watch--
I can't believe this is
my last day in New York.
What are you talking about?
I've been meaning
to tell you, Tom.
When I leave tomorrow,
I'm not coming back.
I've decided
to move to Scotland
to be with Colin.
You're leaving New York?
- I am.
It's exciting, you know,
and it makes sense.
He's next in line to take over
the family business and...
It's a whole new chapter.
Hm.
You were amazing today,
you know that?
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I had no idea
you could juggle like that.
Yeah, well--
I mean, women, yes, china, no.
Yeah, I know.
You're always amazing.
Come.
I'll see you in Scotland soon,
okay?
Yeah, I'll see you
over there.
I'll miss you.
Mwah.
Scotland.
WOMAN:
Come, baby.
Oh, hi there.
- Hi.
Hey.
Nice dogs.
This is Hamish
and this is Callum.
Callum?
- Yeah.
Callum.
What kind of dog is that?
- He's a Scottie.
A Scottie.
Ah. That's perfect.
Fucking Scottie.
I've never felt
like this before.
So hopeless.
So tell me again why you agreed
to be the maid of honor.
Uh, to be with her.
Make her happy.
Figure out some way
to get her off of him.
Maybe that was all wrong.
Maybe he's better for her
than me.
He's Scottish, he can dunk,
he's perfect.
Nobody's perfect.
Although I tell you,
this whiskey comes damn close.
It was a gift from Colin.
He made it.
Swell.
I can't go.
I can't watch Hannah
marry this guy.
She's moving to Scotland,
I've lost her already.
Crap.
If you love something,
set it free.
Said by a pussy
and used by pussies ever since.
Bogie puts her on the plane.
Pussy.
- Bogie's a pussy?
Big pussy.
You know, I've only truly
been in love once.
The most amazing woman
in the world.
She was my best friend.
But I was young, stupid,
and I messed it up.
My great list of mistakes,
that was the greatest.
Who was this?
Your mother.
And when I finally realized
how stupid I was,
I decided to fight for it,
but I was too late.
She wouldn't take me back.
And she was right.
And then it really was
too late.
By the way, uh,
I'm getting another divorce.
Oh, Pop.
Hey. Go and get her,
you pussy.
TOM:
What about the dresses?
UPS is delivering them
tomorrow morning.
I gave you the tracking number.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Okay, so Colin and Hannah
are gonna meet everyone
at the house.
Okay, great.
Thomas.
- Yeah.
Go get 'em,
maid of honor.
Yeah.
Make this
the perfect wedding.
Then steal the bride.
Thanks, guys. Thanks.
Thanks for everything, man.
Thank you so much, all right?
All right, baby.
All right.
All right, all right, all right.
Get out of here.
I'll see you later.
STEPHANIE:
Wow. This is like a fairy tale.
Hannah is so lucky.
- This is a fairy tale.
I know.
- I wish I was her.
STEPHANIE: How she ever found
such a great guy...
HILARY: We'll come visit her.
STEPHANIE: All the time.
Hey. Hey.
What's your name? Huh?
You're a pretty dog.
Oh, I love you.
TOM:
That's his house?
No. Is this the summer house?
The McMurrays
have homes for each season.
This summer home is the smallest.
- Oh.
They also have an autumn home,
winter home, spring--
I know the seasons, buddy.
Somebody's richer than you, Tom.
I guess you gotta go
invent something even stupider.
The entire castle
was actually built in 1220
in the 13th century.
This is incredible, isn't it?
- Yes.
But around the 7th--
- Hi.
Hi.
Grandma Pearl, Joan,
this is my mother, Dierdre,
and my father, Mungo.
How do you do?
- How do you do?
Nice to meet you, Joan.
Nice to meet you. Welcome.
COLIN:
Everyone, I want you
to meet someone
who is so special to my Hannah
and has been a lifelong friend,
and now her maid of honor: Tom.
Hi. Yes.
Did he just say
he's the maid of honor?
He's a bloke.
How do you do?
Very good, thank you.
Mungo.
- Mungo, pleasure. Thank you.
Definitely gay.
COLIN:
Oh, and the, uh--
These are the bridesmaids:
Hilary, Stephanie and Melissa.
How do you do?
- Oh, hello.
Hi.
Nice that you could come.
How do you do?
How do you do?
So, what do you think?
I think they think I'm gay.
What?
- Listen, can we get together?
Talk, catch up?
Tom, Tom,
do you wanna see your chamber?
Oh, I'd love to. Thank you.
Follow me.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Uh, thank you.
Now, then.
I think just a few more sprigs
of gypsophila
at the front there.
Ah. Lovely.
What do you guys think?
Oh, it is gorgeous.
- You look amazing.
It is so pretty.
It's gonna be-- With the veil...
It's so shiny.
- It's you.
Tom.
- Hi.
What do you think?
Of?
The hair.
Yeah, it, um...
This sash will go on the dress.
Really?
- Mm. Tradition.
What's up with the hair?
Well, I'm not
entirely sure that--
Oh, no, no, no.
No, you see,
it's attached up here
with a lovely big...
You're the maid of honor. It's
good to just be supportive--
I'm supportive.
- I don't think you are.
I think I am.
- No, listen to me.
No, you're doing great,
you're doing great.
Hannah.
Actually, you know,
your hair looks amazing.
Really?
Yes.
The games will be starting soon.
Here are your costumes.
Games?
- Oh!
Costumes.
- Our costumes?
What--? What do you
mean "games"?
Oh, the Highland Games.
Uh-huh.
It's a tradition in honor of the wedding.
It goes right back to the time
when the groom had to prove
that he was man enough
to deserve the bride.
If he didn't win,
he didn't get the bride.
No problem for my Colin, ha!
MUNGO :
Doesn't my Colin look handsome?
Who was in charge of that?
Uh, I have no idea.
WOMAN:
Yeah, you're sexy!
MUNGO :
Ladies and gentlemen, the result
of today's Highland Games
A tree.
We're tossing a tree?
Yeah.
Way to go, Colin.
He's strong.
MAN:
Look alive, lassie.
Come on, Tom. Oh, gosh.
Okay, I can do this.
I can do this.
Okay, here we go.
Okay. Okay, okay. I got it.
Whoa, whoa.
TOM:
Okay. Okay. Here we go.
Here we go. Oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Watch your step. Watch your
step. Watch your step. Oh.
What an ass.
Colin McMurray!
Ah, that's great.
COLIN:
# O, my love is like a melody #
# That's sweetly played
In tune #
# As fair art thou
My bonnie lass #
# So deep in love am I #
# And I will love thee still
My dear #
# Till all the seas gang dry #
# And I will love thee still #
# My dear #
# Though t'were 10,000 miles #
MUNGO:
Well done, my boy. Well done.
That is so cute.
Well done, my boy.
Robert Burns,
who wrote that song,
is Scotland's most famous poet.
Oh.
No, no, Auntie, we--
We haven't had any bairns yet,
so we haven't got any names.
Bairns means children.
I'm so sorry, I'm having a hard
time understanding your accent.
Athol.
- Excuse me?
It's a name for the children.
Athol.
- Athol.
Little Athol.
Yeah, no, we won't be naming
our child Athol.
Maybe when he's a teenager.
My mother's third cousin
was the Duke of Athol.
We're a long line of Athols.
Well, maybe-- Maybe we'll
keep it in the mix, eh?
Maybe as a middle name?
- Mm.
Mm-hm.
So, Hannah,
do you like the venison?
Mm, it's delicious.
Colin shot it.
He's a wonderful shot.
COLIN: Oh, stop, Mom,
you'll make me blush.
And this is the moment,
I've just remembered.
What moment's that?
When Colin killed the deer.
I filmed it.
Hm. Oh.
Right between the eyes.
In fact, everything
we are eating this evening,
Colin has killed.
MAN: Colin.
HILARY: To Colin.
In your honor, Hannah.
That is so thoughtful.
I'm so sorry
I didn't kill anything for you.
Oh, gosh. Mm.
What did you get?
Um, I think--
Oh, I love chocolate.
Uh...
Don't-- Don't do that.
Um, if you want some...
Here. Give you some.
Okay?
Excuse me. Hi.
Reverend.
Excuse me. Sorry to--
There you go.
A wonderful dinner.
Delighted, Tom.
And your wife
is looking for you.
Oh, thank you very much.
Mm-hm.
Nice one.
- Cheers.
Mm. A little birdie tells me
Colin personally slayed each one
of these reindeer heads.
Tom.
- You're right.
When I say a little birdie
told me,
he would've told me,
but Colin shot it.
Listen, seriously.
Can we go somewhere private
and talk?
It's important.
Yeah.
Shall we go?
Oh. Bagpipes.
Oh, my God.
Do you know,
he's been playing the bagpipes
ever since he was 3 years old.
Practices every night.
Every night?
Oh, never misses.
- Hm.
What kind of necklace is that?
They're glow-in-the-dark
thunder beads.
Oh, hi, Mom.
I have something for you.
Some evening, huh?
Yes.
This is so you can have
a little piece of home with you.
Thank you.
JOAN:
Oh, look at you.
There's you and Melissa.
You were about 5 there.
Oh, do you remember this?
It was taken at the lake
when your father broke his arm
because of that
silly motorcycle of his.
I miss Dad so much.
Me too, sweetheart.
I just wish
he could've been here.
He was always so worried
I was never gonna meet anyone.
JOAN:
Oh, no, he wasn't.
HANNAH:
Oh, that's Paris.
He could be so off-base
sometimes.
What?
Well, it's just he was always
convinced
that you were gonna marry Tom.
Really?
Hm.
I'll see you
in the morning.
Good night, my angel.
FELIX :
I just-- I just haven't found
the right time.
Any time is the right time
to say "I love you. Marry me."
Right.
Take the shot, win the game
and bring her home.
And stop running up
my long-distance phone bill
with these crazy calls.
Right. Right, right, okay.
Thanks, Felix.
Okay, come on.
You can do this, Tom.
You can do this,
you can do this.
What's wrong with me? You can
do this. You can do this.
Hey.
- Hey.
Hey, I thought we could
go for a walk and, uh,
work on the vows.
Good idea. I could use some help.
- Yeah.
Good, okay.
HANNAH:
I've been working on them,
I think they're getting worse.
At first I went for the emotion,
then I thought,
what if Colin doesn't?
TOM: Yeah.
Then I tried to be funny.
Well, I don't know if Scots
have the same sense of humor
as Americans.
So now I'm back
to something basic.
I veered off into something
boring.
I'm crazy about you.
I think about you all the time.
And I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.
Really?
Really.
That's so generic.
Generic? Generic?
- Yeah.
It totally is.
- How can that be generic?
It sounds like something
somebody's supposed to say
as opposed
to what you're really feeling.
All right, how about, uh...
Nobody in the world
makes me laugh the way you do.
You're my best friend.
I just want to be with you.
STEPHANIE:
Look out, look out, look out!
There she is! Hannah, let's go!
What is this?
This is her "taking out."
- Her what?
Oh, no.
- We dress her up
and then we parade
around one of the pubs.
That's weird.
- It's tradition.
Then we fill a toilet
with salt
and we sell your kisses
for change.
They sell your kisses?
Yup.
STEPHANIE:
Come on, it's like a Scottish
bachelorette party.
STEPHANIE:
Okay, come on.
All right,
let's sell some kisses!
It's her taking out.
She's got the breath
of an angel.
Whew.
Hey!
- Hey.
Whoo-hoo!
All right, all right...
Oh! Another.
Another.
Thank you!
Mwah.
This is it.
This is all I have.
MELISSA:
Oh, my gosh, you guys!
HILARY:
Don't drop the pot.
We have to get
more kisses!
Kisses!
STEPHANIE:
Kisses! Whoo!
Whoa!
I can't take it anymore.
What are you doing?
- Let's do it again.
No.
- For old times' sake.
Don't-- Don't take that off.
No, Tom, I need
to make this up to you.
Don't take this--
No, I'm really unhappy.
That's fine-- No.
- Tom--
That's okay.
I'm not happy at all.
What? Stop it. Ow!
And I am in a really,
really confusing place
in my life right now.
- No, no, no, no, no.
Confusing?
Listen, I have had
some whiskey.
I can tell.
And I need you to service me.
Service you? Service you?
Service me, bitch!
Service me!
TOM :
Be quiet. Be quiet.
MELISSA: You be quiet.
TOM: Get off of me. Get down.
MELISSA: Shh!
TOM: Get down.
MELISSA: You get down.
TOM: Just be quiet.
Quiet.
You be quiet!
No!
No!
Get off!
Wait!
Wait...
Hannah--
Bring me more whiskeys.
Hannah.
It's Tom, let me in.
Let me in.
Go away, Tom.
No, no, no, let me explain.
It's not what you think.
It doesn't matter now.
Yes, it does.
Why did you come--?
Just go.
- I'll go.
Just tell me,
why did you come to my room?
Hannah?
Why did you come
to the room?
To talk about that kiss.
Oh, Hannah.
Please don't--
Don't marry him.
All these years, Tom.
- Don't marry him.
All this time.
You're doing this now?
I know.
How can you do this?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Just let me in.
No, I can't.
Let me in.
You're only doing this now
because you're afraid
of losing me.
I need someone
who's gonna be there for me
no matter what happens.
Someone who truly loves me.
Someone I can trust.
I'm marrying Colin tomorrow.
Tom.
I can't be
your maid of honor.
I can't give you away.
COLIN:
I'm sorry, Hannah.
I'm sorry you and Tom
had a fight.
I'm his best friend.
He's just afraid
of losing me.
He'll get over it.
Aye.
STEPHANIE:
Just suck it. Suck it.
HILARY:
Okay, okay. I am.
STEPHANIE:
Suck it in. Breathe in. More.
HILARY: Hold it.
Give me a hand.
Oh!
I'll hold, you zip.
Okay, okay. Come on.
ALL:
One, two, three!
It didn't-- Oh!
- Oh.
Oh, my God, it fits.
- It fits!
Oh, it fits!
Up top.
Oh--! Oh--! Oh--!
TOM:
Why are we stopping?
Unruly flock.
What?
Hi, sweetie.
I remember you.
Hey.
I love you too.
Thank you.
Turn around.
I have to go back.
Oh, no.
Shit. Shit! Shit!
Hey! I need another ferry boat.
We've only got the one ferry.
- What?
It's waiting over there
for the ceremony to finish.
Oh!
Is there another way
to get there?
You can drive.
Drive. How long?
It'd take about
an hour and a half.
That's too long.
You can swim.
Or you can go on foot
around the shore.
But that would take
a wee while.
Shore. Foot.
A horse.
A horse.
Hey, I need your horse.
My horse?
- Yes.
Hey, come down from there, you.
I need to get to the church.
What do you think
you're planning?
You'll hurt yourself.
I'll give you 3 cents
for every coffee collar used.
You have any idea
how much money that is?
Ah, good luck to you.
Her name's Nancy.
Thanks! Nancy. Go!
I'll see you there.
TOM:
Come on! Giddyup.
TOM:
Hyah! Hyah!
Stick to the shoreline!
Past the monument.
The church is on the left!
What in the name
of the wee man
is a coffee collar?
Ho, easy. Ho!
Whoa-- Whoa-- Oh!
Oh!
Let's just pin
these nice pressed pleats.
And it goes across the dress.
It looks really beautiful.
It's our tartan.
Hyah, hyah!
TOM: Hyah! Hyah!
That's it.
Please be seated.
FOOTE:
We are gathered here together
in the sight of God...
Boys, give me your pins.
FOOTE:...to join together this man
and this--
Hyah, hyah.
This is a celebration of love.
For Colin,
it's through the memories
of seeing his parents' love
as a child.
It's very nice.
FOOTE:
And for Hannah,
it's through the paintings
of Modigliani.
Therefore, if any man
can show just cause...
Ho, whoa, ho!
...let him now speak,
or forever hold his peace.
Tom?
Tom?
Tom?
Tom? Tom?
Tom.
Tom.
Tom!
- Ow!
Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
Tom, what are you doing here?
Oh,
I have to tell you something.
Yeah.
Hannah...
...your hair looks awful.
It does?
Yeah.
- What?
The sash,
it sucks.
Oh, no.
TOM:
But that hair.
It's like a co-op
for parakeets.
What?
Look, Hannah.
You know, I pride myself
on being honest with everybody.
But there's somebody
I've been lying to
for a very long time:
myself.
Because the truth is--
Is scary.
And 10 years ago,
I got in bed
with the wrong girl.
She turned out to be
the right one.
I love you, Hannah.
I always have.
And I always will.
Thomas Bailey,
you are the worst
maid of honor of all time.
Oh, no.
I'm...
so...
very truly sorry.
I don't expect you
to ever forgive me.
Just so you know,
you are the perfect guy.
Just not the perfect guy
for me.
Goodbye, Hannah.
Colin.
What'd she say?
She said I should deck you.
Oh, yeah,
that makes sense.
Asshole.
HANNAH:
I do.
FOOTE:
And, Tom, do you take Hannah
to be your lawfully wedded wife?
TOM:
I do.
FOOTE:
Now, this is the moment.
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.
At last, you may
kiss your bride.
Oh!
Oh, my gosh.
Number six?
- Seven.
You're absolutely glowing
tonight, Grandma Pearl.
Thank you.
It's very nice of you
to say so.
HANNAH:
What are you doing?
I'm just making sure
I got the right girl this time.
You do. Definitely.
Oh, Monica.
Oh, Bill.
