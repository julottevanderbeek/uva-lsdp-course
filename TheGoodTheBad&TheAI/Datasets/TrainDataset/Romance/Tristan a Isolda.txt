Ayear younger than I was for my first.
- When can I have a stag?
-  A stag?
- Come on!
- Tell me again what you said last week.
Let that be a reminder to you.
Why would they join
against the Irish?
- Because someone has to stand up to them.
- You?
Me, Marke, all the tribes.
We can't resist alone.
- I could.
-  My little warrior.
Come home without something
for your lady, you'll have hell to pay.
- Can I?
-  Of course you can, boy.
- The Angles have arrived, my lord-
-
As well as the Celts, my fellow Jutes
and the Saxons.
- we'll all be here.
- Yeah. It's a great day.
- Let us hope so.
- Yeah.
We heard the news.
Pray for a son.
- Mother.
-  Welcome to Tantallon.
But if we were one land- united-
We could defeat them once and for all.
That's why we're here today.
- To sign this treaty of unification.
- Who would be king?
- Lord Marke.
-
Look, if you're happy sending
all your gold to Ireland...
living as slaves,
by all means, do nothing.
If we were happy doing that,
we would never have risked coming here.
Friends, my wife is with child.
My heart tells me it's a boy.
I want him to grow old
in a land where all of us-
Celt, Angle, Jute, Saxon-
are at peace.
This island has not known unity
since the Romans left.
- And why should we follow you?
- Perhaps, Wictred...
because your last attempt
to form an alliance...
without the knowledge of half
the barons in this room has failed.
-
-  Alarm!
-  What for?
- The Irish are here!
-
-
- Take all your men, guard the women.
- But you won't have enough-
Go!
Quickly! Tristan!
Back this way. Hurry!
-
-  Move down the ranks!
-
- How did they know?
-
-
- Tristan!
- No!
Let me fight!
-
-
Please, don't hurt him!
-
- No!
No!
##
She's with the gods now, Isolde.
You'll see her again someday.
Will I?
What news of the treaty?
Your mother loved you so much, Isolde.
Why did she die, Bragnae? Why?
The Irish have been here.
Your husband?
The executions lasted a day.
Who's this?
Tristan, son of Aragon.
What shall we do, my lord?
Three, four.
- One, two-
- Don't hold back.
Come on!
Come on!
Tristan won't fight me.
Look, he's scared!
Three, four.
- Still won't fight?
- He's got the heart of a lion.
Why'd you take off your helmet?
You going to cry?
My father died too,
but you don't see me crying.
- Melot.
- That's right, run.
Find another trapdoor
to hide under, coward.
Tristan! Tristan.
We found something.
Come on, this way.
Quick, come on.
- You are gonna love it.
- You'll love it.
- Who found a trapdoor?
-
All right, Simon.
Well, you tell us how you found it.
Where does this lead?
We always knew the castle
was built on Roman foundations...
but we didn't think
anything was left.
Must be a burial crypt
or something.
Here we are.
Bottom of the keep.
Who else knows about this?
- Nobody.
- Good.
These savages have rebuilt
the castle in Cornwall...
For Cornwall's next tribute,
I want slaves-young ones-
If Marke resists,
have Morholt crush him.
- My king.
- Morholt.
I have led your armies
to victories far and near.
Yes, you have.
You have been most loyal.
When I return from Cornwall,
I was hoping-
What would please you?
What do you think
is really out there?
Do you know what the future
looks like, Bragnae?
I see the life you were meant for.
Am I just a chattel
to be traded at your pleasure?
Do I have no say in my own life?
Your father has given you the news?
- And do you welcome it?
- I accept it.
You know, we're more alike
than you might guess.
How so?
Poison. It's from
the livers of puffer fish.
Just a taste...
paralyzes all the senses.
So if the blade doesn't kill-
And do you know
the antidote for this?
Off me!
- Go find Tristan.
- Leave her!
Anyone foolish enough
to interfere in any way...
- shall suffer the same fate.
- No.
Please don't. Don't.
Take me. No! No!
-
-  Widseth!
If there are any more attacks,
we shall put our guests...
- to death and raze this entire land.
-
-  When would you strike?
- At once.
- Throw everything we have at them.
- They're hoping you'll do that.
On horse they outnumber us 2-to-1 .
You'll lead the men straight to their deaths.
- So we do nothing?
- Donnchadh would like that even more...
me to lose face in front
of the other tribes.
So have the good men of York
come to fight with us?
Hmm? Or the Saxons of Wessex?
My men don't want
to follow a Pict into battle...
let alone one leading
a pack of Angles and Celts.
Then why are you here?
I thought Tristan
should let me command his men.
- I make it my habit to follow no one.
- Except Marke?
Marke delivered me from that palace
when I was a boy. You ran.
So you can understand
when I think ofkings, I think ofhim.
- And when I think of cowards-
-  They're one day from
their boats on the Roman road.
Now, who will ride out
with Tristan to fight them?
What is your plan, Tristan?
-  There they go! After them!
-
Halt!
Go around!
-
- They've got a head.
-
- It's a trap!
Kill the slaves!
- Simon.
-
He shall have a king's service.
The leader and three
will take this message home.
As for the rest-
-
-
And Tristan?
- or did I misuse him for my own purposes?
- He knew.
He knew.
-
-
- Where are we going?
- Away.
Are you afflicted, child?
Speak to me.
Your father will find us
and have my head.
And live a loveless life like my mom?
What's that?
Where?
- Isolde!
- It's a man.
Dead?
Alive! Bragnae, help me!
-
- Help me!
- Isolde.
- Quickly!
- Oh.
- Quickly.
- What are you doing?
- He needs heat. Now.
Quickly! Smell that?
Smell the poison?
When he warms,
we'll need thistle and bark.
I've not been naked
with a man for 15 years.
Hello.
You're in Ireland.
Did you know that?
- No!
- It's all right. You don't need that.
I'll wait outside
with the other beasts.
- You said no one else knew.
- Sorry.
Please?
It's good you're remembering things.
This might sting.
Do you remember anything else?
The boat I found you in?
How you got this?
Too many questions.
There. Keep that dry.
The ocean's outside
if you wish a bath.
You won't know where you're going,
so please don't try to leave.
Why are you doing this?
This is a dangerous game
you're playing.
- He's English, Isolde.
- And we've got him prisoner.
Under no circumstances
tell him your name, you hear me?
I thought you wished
to escape this place.
Did you hear me?
-  You'll do no such thing.
- He'll need more food tomorrow.
- You've been away.
- Oh, you noticed.
- Yes, I have a bit.
- Where?
Bragnae and I were spying
the convent at Brittas.
- Seeking sanctuary?
- Some women need it.
You'll find no refuge
in the new religion.
Any word of my betrothed?
But comforted, no doubt,
that you yearn for him.
What's your name?
Oh, I think it's better
we don't bother with names.
How can I thank you
if I don't have your name?
I'm a lady-in-waiting at the court.
My parents are dead.
My mother, she's the source
of the kindness you find so puzzling.
My father would have
left you where you fell.
I'd guess about you too,
but I think I've already seen everything.
we are taking and will honor us
by leaving as soon as you are able.
Of what?
Tomorrow then?
"There she who bore you
brought you forth.
Don't you think there's more to life?
-  Than what?
- Something more than duty and death.
Why be capable of feelings
if we're not to have them?
Why long for things
if they're not meant to be ours?
Your certainty, it's-it's like armor.
I wish I had that.
- Why would you need it?
- The joy of being a lady.
Wanting something I can't have-
in case your betrothed
would want to see you.
You're promised?
What's he like?
earlier when you spoke
of wanting something you can't have-
I didn't know what
I was talking about.
Outside, just past that bluff,
there is a boat.
That's how you should go
when you leave.
How do you feel?
It's Lord Bodkin!
At this very moment,
the king himself is scouring the coasts.
He'll find you. He finds everyone.
The tide is coming. You must go.
- Come with me.
- I can't.
Tristan, we both know this can't be.
We've known it from the start.
That doesn't mean
it isn't true. It is.
I want to know that you're alive somewhere
and thinking of me from time to time.
I want to know that there's more to this life,
and I can't know that if they kill you.
Hopefully, it's just
his rotted corpse we'll find...
Isolde?
- She is stunned.
- As am I by her grief.
We should, uh-We should assault
the British straightaway.
Maximum force?
The one butchered by Marke's tribes?
Would that be the force you speak of?
We'll not confront them again
until our numbers are refreshed.
Of what nature?
He's offered his daughter
and the lands of Lionath...
as dowry to whichever
English tribe wins.
It's a clever way of setting us
against each other.
Well, the other barons
will see through that.
it's my duty to fight in this tournament
for my people.
- For yourself, you mean.
- And what of the support you promised Tristan?
They see the wealth of Lionath on offer.
That seems more real than any alliance.
- My mind is set.
- And ours as well.
You're weary. Let me rally our friends.
I'll lead them against Donn-
Melot, Melot, Melot,
Melot, Melot.
and you're a noble presence, but-
-  He's back!
-  He's alive!
- Tristan!
- We thought you weren't alive.
He's back! Lord Marke, it's Tristan!
How?
How?
Please, Tristan, tell us more.
- back from the dead.
-  Yeah, back from the dead.
Tristan, the Irish king offers his daughter
in tournament and divides all our tribes.
Whether for the power
or the wealth, half the barons...
- are sending champions to fight at Dunluce.
- Tristan.
"My face in thine eyes...
"And true plain hearts
do in the faces rest.
that none can slacken,
none can die. "
-  What?
- It's the only way to keep the alliance alive.
I fail to see how fighting
with our partners keeps us allies.
Well, they're all going
to the tournament anyway.
By announcing you'll share the dowry
with every baron who remains loyal...
while in turn offering support
to whomever prevails...
- the others will be compelled
to follow you when you win it.
- If we win.
If we lose, we could end up
following Wictred.
- Me.
-
Well, this trip will be my tonic.
I'll be ready.
What's the source of this fervor?
She can make peace
without spilling one drop of blood.
And maybe heal the wound
from which you still ache.
- How do I look?
- How do you look?
Where's this princess?
What's her name, Isolde?
- Name?
- Lebourne of Bracht.
I don't believe you.
-  It's true.
-
Ah, see how the bees
come to the honey.
- Name?
- Tristan of Aragon.
- So he lives.
- For the moment.
Name?
-
- Name?
Why Wictred?
Because the barons
will never unite behind him.
-
-
You think she's got the pox?
the knight has gathered
at tournaments.
Here he sharpens his skills,
settles his differences...
for only a true heart
can prevail in battle.
- Make it look real.
- What?
I yield!
-
-
- Yeah!
- Look.
- No!
- Hey! You can't do that!
-
- Allow it.
-
-
Hunwalt yields to Tristan of Aragon.
Antwon of Wessex
will fight Kingsid.
- Hey!
- It's too easy for you, eh?
- Good, Tristan! Good!
- So much for a fair draw.
- Lord Wictred of Glastonbury-
- Be sure. Choose the right time.
- Wear him down first, huh?
-  Tristan of Aragon
will fight Singbard.
Yeah!
Lord Wictred of Glastonbury
will fight Fohall.
-
- Fohall yields...
-
- to Lord Wictred.
Lord Wictred of Glastonbury
will fight Morlock.
- Mace.
- Tristan of Aragon...
from the house of Cornwall,
will fight Hunwalt.
-
-
-
- Hunwalt yields to Tristan of Aragon.
