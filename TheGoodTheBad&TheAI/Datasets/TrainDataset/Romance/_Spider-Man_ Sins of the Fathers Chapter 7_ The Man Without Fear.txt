- Nice save!
- Thanks.
We've got to get that data disk
before it melts away...
any chance
of clearing Peter Parker.
Here, wouldn't want you
to lose this. Come on.
Why are you so interested
in helping Parker?
I like his work.
He always shoots my good side.
Daredevil, hang on!
I hate to leave you,
but if I don't get that disk...
Peter Parker will be cooked.
I hope this software
isn't soft-boiled yet.
Download complete. Yes!
Get away from that computer.
He's done for.
Let's get out of here!
This time I'm getting you
out of here.
How? You can't see your way
through this smoke.
Maybe some of us look at the
world differently than others.
Thanks. You saved me.
Actually, I was saving
Peter Parker.
- Excuse me?
- You got that disk, right?
Oh, yeah, right. The disk.
This data will clear Parker.
Get it to your pal,
Matt Murdock.
I'm sure he'll be grateful...
as I am... for everything.
Hey, we're even.
Since you and I appear
to be on the same team...
I should tell you who our
real adversary is in all this.
His name is Wilson Fisk.
The entrepreneur
and philanthropist?
That's all a facade.
Fisk is really a devious
criminal mastermind...
who calls himself
the Kingpin.
Wilson Fisk? Wait a minute.
That would explain why
the Hobgoblin was after him.
Spider sense!
Federal agents! Freeze!
Let's split up. Move!
Stop them! Stop them!
Time to pack it in
for the night.
Hope Daredevil got away, too.
Agent Choi, I need to talk
to you about Peter Parker.
He is no traitor...
and you certainly can't
blame him for this.
I'm a little busy, Detective.
Have you followed up
on the other leads?
Who's the guy in the red suit?
How are the Fisks involved?
Why are you rushing
to judgment...
before you've
fully investigated?
As far as I'm concerned,
this investigation is over.
All that's left
is capturing Parker.
You're out of your
jurisdiction here.
Now get lost or I'll have you
hauled in for a reprimand!
Every trace of the secret data
has gone up in flames.
And so has my building.
Yes. But my plan
to frame Parker is succeeding.
Wrong. Peter Parker has escaped.
- What?
- Fools!
With Parker loose, the whole
scheme may be in jeopardy.
It's worse than you think.
Take a look at what
our security camera taped.
How did Spider-Man
know where to look?
Who is leaking information?
This is all your fault.
It was your bad idea...
to frame Parker
in the first place.
But the feds were onto our
data-smuggling operation.
It seemed like the most elegant
way to throw them off our trail.
We are under even more scrutiny
now than before.
And at this moment,
Spider-Man may hold...
the most incriminating
evidence against me.
- May Parker...
- Wait. Listen to this.
...the aunt of fugitive
Peter Parker...
reportedly collapsed
in her home.
She's been rushed
to Mercy Memorial Hospital.
A glimmer of light
through the gloom.
Should Parker be stupid enough
to visit his ailing aunt...
see to it that we are there
to welcome him.
We may have lost the data disk,
but we will have Parker.
Mr. Murdock?
Looks like I've got
the place to myself.
Let's see what the news says
about tonight's little bonfire.
Parker's aunt collapsed and was
rushed to Mercy Memorial.
What?
At this time, there is no word
on how serious her condition is.
Aunt May!
Good news, Peter.
Daredevil has given us...
the evidence we need
to appeal your conviction.
Matt, my Aunt May's
in the hospital.
I've gotta see her right away!
I'd have to advise against that.
You're still an escaped felon.
It would be wiser to cooperate
with the authorities...
and turn yourself in.
I can't waste the time now.
If anything happens to her...
You have no idea what it's like
to lose someone you love.
Maybe I know
better than you think.
As your attorney,
I must advise against this.
But as your friend,
I understand.
I'll take the disk to the feds.
Maybe I can persuade them
to suspend their dragnet.
Just be careful.
You're still a fugitive.
If anyone sees you...
they might shoot first
and ask questions later.
I won't be seen.
Will she be OK, doctor?
It's too soon to tell. She's
been under a lot of stress.
I'll check back
in a little while.
That Peter. What he puts
May through is unforgivable.
I don't care
what trouble he's in!
His place is here
with his ailing aunt.
If I were Peter Parker...
wild horses
couldn't keep me away.
I swear, sometimes I think
May would be better off...
if they caught Peter
and locked him up until...
Aunt Anna, that's enough.
I won't listen to this anymore.
What was that all about?
Mary Jane doesn't like hearing
bad things about Peter.
You OK?
Not really, Harry, no.
It's Peter.
I'm so worried about him.
The data on this disk proves
that my client is innocent.
- How did you get it?
- Let's just say...
Peter has people
looking out for him.
I need a receipt. The only copy.
Time is of the essence,
Mr. Murdock.
My people are tracking Parker.
They might shoot him on sight.
Point well taken.
I must make
immediate arrangements...
to protect
and exonerate Parker.
- Yes?
- I have the package you wanted.
Peter!
What are you doing here?
There are police everywhere.
I need your help. You haven't
given up on me, have you?
Never. You can always
count on me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Harry and I are...
I know. Listen, I must
get in to see Aunt May.
- Can you think of a way?
- Leave it to me.
There you are, Dr. Peters.
Mrs. Parker's taken a turn
for the worse. Hurry!
Aunt May, can you hear me?
Peter, you're here.
Everything's gonna be OK.
Mr. Murdock has evidence
that will clear me.
I told them you were innocent.
My Peter is a good boy.
She should rest now, Peter.
I'd better get out of here.
I may be placing
both of you in danger.
Now what?
You? Why, of all the nerve!
Anna Watson activated
my spider sense?
She must be really mad at me.
Oh, Anna, it's wonderful.
That nice lawyer Mr. Murdock...
has proof
that Peter is innocent.
- I'm happy to hear it. Really.
- I've gotta go.
There are still a few people
who haven't heard the news.
I see. Then you'll need help
getting out of here.
Let me do what I can.
Why is my spider sense
still going crazy?
Excuse me, Doctor. Have you seen
my niece Mary Jane?
It's sure nice of you
to help, Aunt Anna.
Oh, I'm not doing this
entirely for Peter.
It's more for my own benefit.
Chameleon!
Nice work, Agent Choi.
My father knew his investment
in you would pay off.
Thanks for calling me
right away, Detective Lee.
That disk was Parker's
one chance to be exonerated.
There'll be the devil
to pay for this.
Data on this disk
could've destroyed my father.
He'll be pleased
with all we've done.
What is it, Richard?
Father, I have
the data disk and Parker.
I've taken care
of all your problems.
Splendid. I shall await news
that you've eradicated both.
You see, Smythe, my son
has cleaned up your mess.
How touching.
It is. I must say,
it pleases me greatly...
knowing that my relationship
with my son...
is nothing like I went through
with my own father.
Your father. It occurs to me...
I know very little
about your past.
What was your father like?
What is the best way to say it?
I believe "small-time hood"
sums it up.
But my father wanted more
out of life.
He wanted to become
a member of the mob.
As for myself, I was lonely...
ostracized because of my weight.
My father had great dreams.
But things never went
my father's way.
Willy, what are you
doing here?!
Come on! Let's go!
Whatever my father touched
turned positively putrid.
Over the years,
I tried to join my father...
in his business pursuits.
I wanted to gain his acceptance.
I failed.
Sometimes sacrifices
must be made.
Sorry, son,
that's the way things are.
Young man, this court
is willing to show leniency...
but you must name
your accomplice.
Now I was all alone.
I realized I was going
to have to learn to survive...
or be destroyed,
and I did learn.
By the time I got out,
I had acquired all the skills...
needed to begin building
my criminal empire.
I even took a new name... Fisk.
But I quickly became known
as "The Kingpin."
I used my mastery
of technology...
to break into the law
enforcement computer system...
and to eradicate all records of
my previous criminal identity.
Only one thing remained
to link me to the past.
We found him for you, Kingpin.
It is you! Nobody believed me...
but I knew the famous Kingpin
was really my boy Willy.
Wrong! As far as
the world must know...
Willy ceased to exist
when you left him in prison.
Now it's your turn.
No! Please!
Willy, don't do this!
I knew you were ruthless,
but this...
Sacrifices must be made.
Let her go! You've got me!
It's hard to believe...
after all the risks
I took as Spider-Man...
that Parker is gonna be
the one to take the fall.
If only I could save
the woman I love.
You've been here before.
This time
I'll make sure it works.
It will all be over
in a matter of minutes.
Peter, what's going on?
It's Terri Lee!
What's she doing here?
We'll have to fight.
Police!
Take cover!
I can hardly breathe.
Time to even the odds.
Look out!
Nice work, Detective.
I cannot bear incompetence.
Execute the contingency plan!
Take cover over here.
I'll be back.
With all that movement,
my spider sense...
can't lock in on who's who!
No doubt now
who the impostor is.
Only the real thing could
do that with a billy club.
Catch you later.
I've got to check on a friend.
Nice moves.
Hey, I'm a single woman
living in New York.
Self-defense classes are a must.
Going my way?
Chameleon!
Book him.
Up there!
I know this place.
I was here when a crook named
"The Hobgoblin" took it over.
Good. Since you're familiar
with the layout...
why don't you keep
security busy...
while I settle
some unfinished business?
Can you guys tell me where
the little spider's room is?
Where is the other one?!
Right here, Kingpin,
and the name's Daredevil.
You would have to be a daredevil
to dare to challenge me.
I'm taking your family.
The police have your son...
- and I have you.
- My son?!
You are weak! Useless!
You are weak, Willy! Useless!
This time, the fight is mine!
Father, no!
Father, no!
- Now you're mine.
- No, you're mine!
Hold on, Moby Dick!
Time for me to reel you in!
Empty? Not now!
We can't let him get away.
Hang on to your cowl.
Take her down, pal!
The only thing
going down is you!
Let's hope he's good
at blind landings.
Helpless as a beached whale.
I'm afraid the Kingpin's
had the last laugh again.
Chameleon! How did you guess?
I can see through disguises.
The real Kingpin
must've made the switch...
back at Crime Central.
Well, at least
he's still got the CD-ROM...
that proves
Peter Parker is innocent.
Wait a minute. If you can
see through disguises...
does that mean
you've seen through mine?
No, I've respected
your right to privacy.
I'm a big believer
in the constitution and the law.
This court finds
Richard Fisk, Susan Choi...
and the criminal known
as "The Chameleon" guilty.
This court is willing
to show leniency...
but you must name
your accomplices, if any.
Sacrifices must be made.
I must apologize for
the trouble you went through.
I did not realize my son
was stealing secrets.
I can't believe
I have to swallow this.
But if I let on that I know
he's a criminal...
he can figure out who I am.
Apology accepted.
But watch it, Kingpin.
Spider-Man now knows the truth.
I've had it
with your bungling, Smythe.
Your days here are numbered.
Leave me!
Now, how many days
shall I have to wait...
for my son to exact his revenge?
Jonah, I don't understand.
Why won't you let me tell Parker
that you paid for his defense?
Lt'd spoil my image. Besides...
I don't want Parker getting
the idea I like him.
Which reminds me, Robbie...
who told you you could
offer Parker his job back?
That goofy kid couldn't focus
if his life depended on it!
- So, you're leaving?
- Murdock's been called to D. C...
on special assignment
for the justice department.
It's up to you to hold
Kingpin at bay here...
while Murdock and I gather
enough legal evidence...
to put him behind bars forever.
You know, I just realized that
I don't know much about you.
How did you and Murdock
first join forces?
It's unfortunate
that we masked men...
must hide so much
from the world.
But there is one thing
you do need to know.
Behind this mask
is the face of a friend...
and a lifelong partner
in your war against Kingpin.
Thanks.
Good-bye, Daredevil,
and don't worry.
I'm going to fight
the Kingpin...
to the bitter end, so help me.
