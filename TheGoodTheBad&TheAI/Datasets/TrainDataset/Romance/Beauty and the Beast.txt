NARRATOR:
Once upon a time
in a faraway land
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.
Although he had
everything his heart desired
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.
But then, one winter's night
an old beggar woman
came to the castle
and offered him a single rose
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.
Repulsed by
her haggard appearance
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away
but she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances
for beauty is found within
and when he dismissed her again
the old woman's ugliness
melted away
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late
for she had seen that there was
no love in his heart
and as punishment,
she transformed him
into a hideous beast
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle
and all who lived there.
Ashamed of his monstrous form
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle
with a magic mirror
as his only window
to the outside world.
The rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose
which would bloom
until his 21st year.
If he could learn
to love another
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell
then the spell would be broken.
If not, he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time.
As the years passed,
he fell into despair
and lost all hope
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?
Little town,
it's a quiet village
Every day
like the one before
Little town,
full of little people
Waking up... to... say...
Bonjour!
Bonjour!
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!
Bonjour!
There goes the baker
With his tray like always
The same old bread
and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning
that we came
To this poor
provincial town...
Good morning, Belle.
Good morning, Monsieur.
Where are you off to?
The bookshop.
I just finished
the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk
and an ogre, and...
That's nice.
Marie! The baguettes.
Hurry up!
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange,
no question
Dazed and distracted,
can't you tell?
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's
up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl,
that Belle
Bonjour
Good day
How is your family?
Bonjour
Good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive
There must be more
than this provincial life...
MAN:
Ah, Belle.
Good morning.
I've come to return
the book I borrowed.
Finished already?
Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?
Not since yesterday.
That's all right.
I'll borrow... this one.
That one?
But you've read it twice.
Well, it's my favorite--
far-off places
daring sword fights
magic spells, a
prince in disguise.
If you like it
all that much, it's yours.
- But, sir...
- I insist.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar
I wonder
if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest
of us is Belle
Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part
because you'll see
Here's where she meets
Prince Charming
But she won't discover
that it's him
Till Chapter Three
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Now, it's no wonder
that her name means beauty
Her looks have got
no parallel
But behind
that fair facade
I'm afraid
she's rather odd
Very different
from the rest of us
GROUP:
She's nothing like
the rest of us
Yes, different
from the rest of us is Belle
Wow, you didn't miss
a shot, Gaston.
You're the greatest hunter
in the whole world.
I know.
No beast alive
stands a chance against you
and no girl,
for that matter.
It's true, Lefou
and I've got my sights set
on that one.
LEFOU:
The inventor's daughter?
She's the one-- the lucky girl
I'm going to marry.
But, she...
The most beautiful girl in town.
I know, but...
That makes her the best
and don't I
deserve the best?
Well, of course.
I mean, you do, but...
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her
I said, "She's gorgeous,"
and I fell
I said, "She's gorgeous,"
and I fell
Here in town there's only she
who is beautiful as me
So, I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle
Look, there he goes,
isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston,
oh, he's so cute
Be still, my heart,
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark,
strong and handsome brute
- Bonjour / Pardon
- Good day / Mais oui
- You call this bacon?
- What lovely grapes
- Ten yards / Some cheese
- 'Scuse me / One pound
I'll get the knife
Please let me through
This bread / Those fish
It's stale / They smell
Madame's mistaken
There must be more
Than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going
to make Belle my wife
Look, there she goes
A girl who's strange
but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is
a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle...
GASTON:
Bonjour, bonjour.
Hello, Belle.
Bonjour, Gaston.
Gaston,
may I have my book, please?
How can you read this?
There's no pictures.
Well, some people
use their imagination.
Belle, it's about time
you got your head
out of those books
and paid attention
to more important things...
like me.
The whole town's
talking about it.
It's not right
for a woman to read.
Soon she starts getting ideas,
and thinking...
Gaston,
you are positively primeval.
:
Why, thank you, Belle.
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern
and take a look
at my trophies?
Maybe some other time.
What's wrong with her?
She's crazy.
He's gorgeous.
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home
to help my father.
Good-bye.
:
That crazy old loon--
he needs all the
help he can get.
Don't talk about my father
that way.
Yeah, don't talk
about her father that way.
My father is not crazy.
He's a genius.
Ooh!
:
Papa?
How on earth did that happen?
Doggone it!
Are you all right, Papa?
I'm about ready to give
up on this hunk of junk.
You always say that.
I mean it this time.
I'll never get
this boneheaded contraption
to work!
Yes, you will
and you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.
Humph!
And become
a world-famous inventor.
You really believe that?
I always have.
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'll have this thing fixed
in no time.
Hand me that, uh...
dog-legged clincher, there.
So, did you have a
good time in town today?
I got a new book.
Papa, do you think I'm odd?
My daughter? Odd?
Where would you get
an idea like that?
Oh, I don't know.
It's just that I'm not sure
I fit in here.
There's no one
I can really talk to.
What about that Gaston?
He's a handsome fellow.
He's handsome, all right,
and rude, and conceited, and...
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.
Well, don't you worry
'cause this invention's
going to be the start
of a new life for us.
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.
It works!
It does?
-
- It does!
You did it!
You really did it!
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!
Good-bye, Papa.
Good luck.
Good-bye, Belle,
and take care while I'm gone.
We should be there
by now.
Maybe we've missed
the turn.
I guess I should have taken...
Wait a minute.
Let's go this way.
Come on, Philippe,
it's a shortcut.
We'll be there in no time.
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us,
Philippe?
We'd better turn around.
Whoa...
Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa, Philippe.
Oh...!
Oh, look out!
Oh, look out!
Whoa!
Whoa, boy!
Back up, back up, back up!
Good boy, good boy.
That's it.
Back up!
Steady, steady.
Now, steady.
Philippe, no!
Philippe.
Oh...
Help!
Is someone there?!
Help!
Oh!
What...?
Oh...
:
Hello?
Hello?
MALE 1:
Poor fellow, must have
lost his way in the woods.
MALE 2:
Keep quiet; maybe
he'll go away.
Is someone there?
Not a word, Lumiere;
not one word.
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse
and I need a place to stay
for the night.
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.
Shh!
Of course, Monsieur,
you are welcome here.
Who said that?
Over here.
Where?
Allo.
Incredible.
Well, now you've done it,
Lumiere.
Splendid, just peachy. Ah!
How is this accomplished?
Put me down at once!
Stop that!
Stop that, I say.
Ow!
Huh... Close that at once.
Do you mind?!
I-I beg your pardon.
It's, it's just
that I've never seen a...
Oh, you are soaked to the bone,
Monsieur.
Come, warm yourself by the fire.
Thank you.
COGSWORTH:
No, no, no.
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.
I demand
that you stop right there.
Oh, no, no!
Not the master's chair.
I'm not seeing this!
I am not seeing this!
:
Well, hello there, boy.
What service.
All right,
this has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here.
How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?
It'll warm you up
in no time.
No. No tea.
No tea!
His mustache tickles, Mama.
Oh!
Hello.
Uh-oh.
Oh...
Ah...
There's a stranger here.
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman
was lost in the woods.
He was cold and wet...
Master, I'd like
to take this moment to say
I was against this
from the start.
It was all his fault.
I tried to stop them,
but would they listen to me? No.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I-I-I was lost in the woods,
and, and...
You're not welcome here!
I-I-I'm sorry.
What are you staring at?!
N-Nothing.
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?!
Please, I meant no harm!
I just needed
a place to stay.
I'll give you
a place to stay.
Oh, no...!
Please! Oh, no!
Oh, boy, Belle's going to get
the surprise of her life
huh, Gaston?
Yep. This is her lucky day.
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.
But first I'd better go in there
and propose to the girl.
And you, Lefou--
now, when
Belle and I come
out that door...
Oh, I know, I know!
I-I strike up the band.
Not yet!
Sorry.
Gaston.
What a pleasant surprise.
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.
You know, Belle, there's
not a girl in town
who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.
This is the day...
Hmm.
Yeah.
This is the day your
dreams come true.
This is the day your
dreams come true.
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?
Plenty. Here, picture this:
A rustic hunting lodge
my latest kill
roasting on the fire
and my little wife,
massaging my feet
while the little ones
play on the floor
with the dogs.
We'll have six or seven.
Dogs?
No, Belle!
Strapping boys,
like me.
Imagine that.
And do you know
who that little
wife will be?
Let me think.
You, Belle.
Gaston, I'm...
I'm...
speechless.
I really don't
know what to say.
Say you'll marry me.
I'm very sorry,
Gaston, but...
but...
I just don't deserve you.
- Whoa!
-
So, how'd it go?
I'll have Belle for my wife.
Make no mistake about that!
Touchy.
Is he gone?
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.
Me, the wife of that boorish,
brainless...
Madame Gaston
Can't you just see it?
Madame Gaston
His little wife
No, sir, not me
I guarantee it
I want much more
than this provincial life
I want adventure
in the great, wide somewhere
I want it more
than I can tell
And for once
it might be grand
To have someone understand
I want so much more
than they've got planned.
Philippe!
What are you doing here?
Where's...?
Where's Papa?
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?
Oh, we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.
What is this place?
Philippe, please!
Steady!
Steady.
Papa.
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?
Just had to invite him
to stay, didn't we?
Serve him tea.
Sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch.
I was trying
to be hospitable.
:
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello? Papa?
Papa?
Are you here?
Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.
Really, Mama.
I saw her.
Not another word.
But...
Into the tub.
Woop...
Well! I saw a girl
in the castle!
See? I told you.
Irresponsible,
devil-may-care
waxy-eared,
slack-jawed...
BELLE:
Papa?
Did you see that?
It's a girl!
I know it's a girl.
Don't you see?
She's the one--
the girl we have
been waiting for.
She has come
to break the spell!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Papa?
Papa?
Hello?
Is someone here?
Wait!
I'm looking for
my father. I...
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.
I-Is anyone here?
MAURICE:
Belle?
Papa!
H-How did you find me?
Oh, your hands
are like ice.
I have to get
you out of there.
Belle, I want you
to leave this place.
Who's done this to you?
No time to explain.
You must go! Now!
I won't leave you!
What are you doing here?
Run, Belle!
Who's there?
Who are you?
The master of this castle.
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?
Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here!
But he could die.
Please, I-I'll do anything.
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.
Oh, there must be
some way I can...
Wait!
Take me instead.
You?!
You would...
take his place?
Belle, no!
You don't know
what you're doing!
If I did,
would you let him go?
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.
Come into the light.
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!
You have my word.
Done!
No, Belle,
listen to me.
I'm old.
I've lived my life.
Wait.
Belle!
Wait!
No, please spare my daughter.
Please!
She's no longer
your concern.
Take him
to the village.
Let me out!
Please let me out!
Let me out!
Please! Oh, please!
Master?
What?
Since the girl is going
to be with us
for quite some time
I was thinking that you
might want to offer her
a more comfortable room.
Then again, maybe not.
You didn't even let me
say good-bye.
I'll never see him
again.
I didn't get
to say good-bye.
I'll show you to your room.
My room?
But I thought...
You want to stay in the tower?
No.
Then follow me.
Say something to her.
Huh? Oh.
l, uh, hope you like it here.
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like
except the west wing.
What's in the west...?
It's forbidden!
Now, if you need anything
my servants will attend you.
Dinner.
Invite her to dinner.
You will join me
for dinner.
That's not a request!
GASTON:
Who does she think she is?
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.
No one says no
to Gaston.
Darn right.
Dismissed, rejected...
publicly humiliated.
Why, it's more
than I can bear.
More beer?
What for?
Nothing helps.
I'm disgraced.
Who, you?
Never!
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston
Looking so down
in the dumps
Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking
your lumps
There's no man in town
as admired as you
You're everyone's
favorite guy
Everyone's awed and
inspired by you
And it's not very hard
to see why
No... one's...
Slick as Gaston
No one's quick
as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly
thick as Gaston
For there's no man in town
half as manly
Perfect, a pure paragon
You can ask any Tom, Dick
or Stanley
And they'll tell you
whose team
They prefer to be on
Ooh!
No... one's...
been like Gaston
A kingpin like Gaston
No one's got a full cleft
In his chin
like Gaston
As a specimen, yes,
I'm intimidating
My, what a guy, that Gaston
Give five "hurrahs!"
Give 12 "hip-hips!"
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips
No... one...
Fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston
In a wrestling match,
nobody bites like Gaston
For there's no one
as burly and brawny
As you see,
I've got biceps to spare
Not a bit of him
scraggly or scrawny
That's right
And every last inch of me's
covered with hair
No one hits like Gaston
Matches wits like Gaston
In a spitting match,
nobody spits like Gaston
I'm especially good
at expectorating
Ptooey!
Ten points for Gaston!
When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs
Every morning
to help me get large
And now
that I'm grown
I eat
five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly
the size of a barge
No... one...
Shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts
like Gaston
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston
I use antlers
in all of my decorating
My, what a guy
Gaston!
Help!
Help!
Someone help me!
Maurice?
Please, please!
I need your help.
He's got her...
He's got her locked
in the dungeon.
Who?
Belle. We must go.
N-Not a minute to lose.
Whoa!
Slow down, Maurice.
Who's got Belle locked
in a dungeon?
A beast!
A horrible, monstrous
beast.
Is it a big beast?
Huge!
With a long ugly snout?
Hideously ugly.
And sharp,
cruel fangs?
Yes, yes.
Will you help me?
All right,
old man.
We'll help you out.
You will?
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you!
:
Oh!
:
Oh!
Crazy old Maurice.
He's always good
for a laugh.
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?
Crazy old Maurice... hmm.
Lefou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking
A dangerous pastime...
I know
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father
And his sanity's
only so-so
Now the wheels
in my head
Have been turning
Since I looked at
that loony old man
See, I promised myself
I'd be married to Belle
And right now,
I'm evolving a plan
If I...
LEFOU:
Yes?
Then we...
No! Would she...?
Guess!
Now I get it!
BOTH:
Let's go!
No... one...
Plots like Gaston
Takes cheap shots
like Gaston
Plans to persecute
harmless crackpots like Gaston
TOWNSFOLK:
So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating
My, what a guy!
Gaston!
Will no one help me?
Who is it?
Mrs. Potts, dear.
I thought you might
like a spot of tea.
But you're... you're a...
Ooh!
Careful.
This is impossible.
I know it is.
But here we are.
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?
All right, Chip,
now, that'll do.
Slowly now.
Don't spill.
Thank you.
Want to see me
do a trick?
MRS. POTTS:
Chip!
Oops. Sorry.
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.
We all think so.
But I've lost my father
my dreams... everything.
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out
all right
in the end.
You'll see.
Oh, listen to me.
Jabbering on while
there's a supper
to get on the table.
Chip!
Bye.
Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?
Oh, let's see what I got
in my drawers.
Ooh! How embarrassing.
Ah, here we are.
You'll look ravishing
in this one.
That's very kind
of you, but...
I'm not going
to dinner.
Oh, but you must.
Dinner is served.
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.
Why isn't she here yet?
Oh, try to be
patient, sir.
The girl has
lost her father
and her freedom,
all in one day.
Master, have you thought
that perhaps this girl could
be the one to break the spell?
Of course I have.
I'm not a fool.
Good!
So, you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you
and poof!
The spell is broken.
We'll be human again
by midnight.
Ooh, it's not
that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.
Oh, it's no use.
She's so beautiful, and I'm...
Well, look at me!
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.
I don't know how.
Well, you can start
by making yourself
more presentable.
Straighten up.
Try to act like
a gentleman.
Ah, yes.
When she comes in
give her a dashing,
debonair smile.
Come, come,
show me the smile.
But don't frighten
the poor girl.
Impress her
with your rapier wit.
But be gentle.
Shower her
with compliments.
But be sincere.
And above all...
BOTH:
You must control your temper!
Here she is!
Good evening.
Well, where is she?
Who? Oh.
The girl, yes.
The... girl.
Well, actually,
she's in the process of...
Circumstances being
what they are...
She's not coming.
What?!
But, your grace...!
Your eminence!
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!
BELLE:
I'm not hungry.
You come out, or I'll...
I'll... I'll break down
the door!
Master...
I could be wrong,
but that may not be
the best way
to win the girl's affections.
Please attempt
to be a gentleman.
But she is being so difficult.
Gently, gently.
Will you come down to dinner?
No.
Hmm?
Ah, ah, ah!
Suave, genteel.
It would give me
great pleasure
if you would join
me for dinner.
:
We say please.
Please.
No, thank you!
You can't stay in there forever!
Yes, I can.
Fine. Then go ahead
and starve!
If she doesn't eat with me
then she doesn't eat at all.
Oh, dear.
That didn't go very well
at all, did it?
Lumiere, stand watch
at the door
and inform me at once
if there is
the slightest change.
You can count on me,
mon capitan.
Well, we might as well
go downstairs
and start cleaning up.
I ask nicely,
but she refuses.
Well, what does
she want me to do... beg?
Show me the girl.
Well, the master's
really not so bad
once you get
to know him.
Why don't you
give him a chance?
I don't want to
get to know him.
I don't want to
have anything
to do with him!
I'm just fooling myself.
She'll never see me
as anything...
but a monster.
It's hopeless.
GIRL:
Oh, no!
LUMIERE:
Oh, yes!
Oh, no!
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
I've been burned
by you before.
Zut, alors!
She has emerged!
Come on, Chip,
into the cupboard
with your brothers
and sisters.
But I'm not sleepy.
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.
I work and I slave all
day long and for what?
A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste.
Oh, stop your grousing.
It's been a long night
for all of us.
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.
After all,
he did say please.
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper
he'll never break...
Splendid to see you
out and about, Mademoiselle.
I am Cogsworth,
head of the household.
This is Lumiere.
Enchante, cherie.
If there's...
Stop that!
...anything we...
Please!
can do to make your
stay more comfortable.
Ow!
I am a little hungry.
You are?
Hear that?
She's hungry.
Stoke the fire.
Break out
the silver.
Wake the china.
Remember what the master said.
Oh, pishposh.
I'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.
All right, fine.
Glass of water, crust
of bread, and then...
Cogsworth, I am
surprised at you.
She is not a prisoner.
She's our guest.
We must make her
feel welcome here.
Right this way,
Mademoiselle.
Well, keep it down.
If the master finds out
about this
it will be
our necks.
Of course, of course.
But what is dinner
without a little music?
Music?
Ma chere
mademoiselle.
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure
that we welcome you tonight.
And now
we invite you
to relax.
Let us
pull up a chair
as the dining room
proudly presents...
your dinner.
Be... our... guest
Be our guest
Put our service
to the test
Tie your napkin 'round
your neck, cherie
And we provide the rest
Soup du jour,
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live
to serve
Try the gray stuff
It's delicious
Don't believe me,
ask the dishes
They can sing,
they can dance
After all, Miss,
this is France
And a dinner here
is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then
You'll be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest
Beef ragout,
cheese souffle
Pie and pudding
en flambe
We'll prepare and serve
with flair
A culinary cabaret
You're alone
and you're scared
But the banquet's
all prepared
No one's gloomy
or complaining
While the flatware's
entertaining
We tell jokes,
I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks
And it's all in perfect taste,
that you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own
free pass
To be our guest--
If you're stressed
It's fine dining
we suggest--
Be our guest,
be our guest
Be our guest!
:
Life is so unnerving
For a servant
who's not serving
He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon
Get off!
-
- Ah, those good old days
when we were useful
Huh?
Suddenly, those good
old days are gone
:
Oh!
Ten years
we've been rusting
Needing so much more
than dusting
Needing exercise
A chance
to use our skills
Most days we just
lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in
and oops-a-daisy!
It's a guest, it's a guest!
Sakes alive,
well, I'll be blessed
Wine's been poured,
And thank the lord
I've had the napkins
freshly pressed
With dessert,
she'll want tea
And, my dear,
that's fine with me
While the cups
do their soft-shoeing
I'll be bubbling,
I'll be brewing
I'll get warm,
piping hot
Heaven's sake,
is that a spot?
Clean it up, we want
the company impressed
We've got a lot to do
Is it one lump or two?
For you, our guest
She's our guest
She's our guest
She's our guest
People, fun's over,
over here, line up...
It's ten years since
we've had anybody here
And we're obsessed
With your meal,
with your ease
Yes, indeed,
we aim to please
While the candlelight's
still glowing
Let us help you,
we'll keep going
Course... by... course
One by one
Till you shout,
"Enough, I'm done!"
Then we'll sing you
off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop
your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest,
be our guest
Be our guest
Please be our guest!
Bravo!
That was wonderful.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it?
Yes, everyone.
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed,
off to bed.
Oh, I couldn't possibly
go to bed now.
It's my first time
in an enchanted castle.
Enchanted!
Who said anything
about the castle
being enchanted?
It was you, wasn't it?
I figured it out for myself.
I'd like to look around,
if that's all right.
Oh, would you
like a tour?
Wait a second,
wait a second.
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea.
We can't let her
go poking around
in certain places, if
you know what I mean.
Perhaps you'd like
to take me.
I'm sure you know
everything
there is to know
about the castle.
Oh, well, actually, l, uh...
Yes, I do.
As you can see
the pseudo-facade
was stripped away
to reveal a minimalist
rococo design.
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.
This is yet another example
of the late neoclassic
baroque period.
and, as I always say
if it's not baroque,
don't fix it.
Uh, where was I?
As you were.
Now, then, if I may
draw your attention
to the flying buttresses
above the...
Uh, Mademoiselle?
What's up there?
Where? There?
Oh, nothing.
Absolutely nothing
of interest at all
in the west wing.
Dusty, dull, very boring.
Ah, so that's the west wing.
Nice going.
I wonder what
he's hiding up there?
Hiding?
The master is
hiding nothing.
Then it wouldn't
be forbidden.
Perhaps, uh,
Mademoiselle would like to
uh-uh, uh...
see something else.
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...
maybe later.
Th-The gardens or-or
the-the-the-the
library, perhaps.
You have a library?
:
Yes, oh, indeed.
With books.
Scads of books!
Mountains of books!
Forests of books!
- Cascades!
- Longboats!
Swamps of books!
COGSWORTH:
More books than you'll
ever be able
to read in a lifetime.
Books on every subject ever
studied, by every author
who ever set pen
to paper.
Oh!
Why did you come here?
I'm... I'm sorry.
I warned you never
to come here.
I didn't mean any harm.
Do you realize
what you could have done?!
Please, stop.
Get out!
:
No!
:
Get... out!
Where are you going?
Promise or no promise
I can't stay here
another minute.
Oh, no, wait,
please.
Please wait.
Oh!
Oh!
Here now.
Oh, don't do that.
Just hold still.
That hurts!
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!
Well, if you hadn't
have run away
this wouldn't
have happened!
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away!
Well, you shouldn't have
been in the west wing!
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!
Now hold still.
This might sting a little.
Hmm?
By the way, thank you.
For saving my life.
You're welcome.
I don't usually
leave the asylum
in the middle
of the night
but he said you'd make it
worth my while.
Ah.
I'm listening.
It's like this.
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle
but she needs a little...
persuasion.
Turned him down flat.
Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.
He was in here tonight
raving about a beast
in a castle.
Maurice is harmless.
The point is,
Belle would do anything
to keep him
from being locked up.
Yeah. Even marry him.
So you want me
to throw her father
into the asylum
unless she agrees
to marry you.
Oh, that is despicable.
I love it!
MAURICE:
If no one will help me
then I'll go back alone.
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care
what it takes.
I'll find that castle,
and somehow
I'll get her out of there.
Belle? Maurice?
Oh, well.
I guess it's not going
to work after all.
They have to come
back sometime.
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.
Lefou...
don't move
from that spot
until Belle and
her father come home.
But, but, I...
Aw, nuts.
I've never felt this way
about anyone.
I want to do something for her.
But what?
Well, there's the usual things.
Flowers, chocolates.
Promises you don't intend
to keep.
Ah, no, no.
It has to be something
very special.
Something that sparks
her interest.
Wait a minute!
Belle, there's something
I want to show you.
But first, you have
to close your eyes.
It's a surprise.
Can I open them?
No, no. Not yet.
Wait here.
Now can I open them?
All right.
Now.
I can't believe it!
I've never seen
so many books in all my life!
You-You like it?
It's wonderful!
Then it's yours.
Oh, thank you
so much.
Oh, would you
look at that!
I knew it would work.
What?
What worked?
It's very
encouraging.
Isn't this exciting?
I didn't see anything.
Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.
But what are
they talking about?
What's going on?
Come on, Mom.
BELLE:
There's something sweet
And almost kind
But he was mean
And he was coarse
and unrefined
And now he's dear,
and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it
there before
BEAST:
She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched
She didn't shudder
at my paw
No, it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked
at me that way before
BELLE:
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought
that this could be?
True that he's no
Prince Charming
But there's something
in him
That I simply didn't see...
Well, who'd
have thought?
Well, bless my soul
Well, who'd
have known?
Well, who indeed?
And who'd
have guessed
They'd come together
on their own?
It's so peculiar
We'll wait and see
A few days more
There may be something there
that wasn't there before...
You know,
perhaps there is
Something there
that wasn't there before
What?
There may be something there
that wasn't there before.
What's there, Mama?
Shh!
I'll tell you
when you're older.
Right, then!
You all know why we're here.
We have exactly 12 hours,
to create the most magical
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.
"Or beast..."
Right.
Need I remind you
that if the last petal falls
from this rose
the spell will never be...
broken!
Very well.
You all know your assignments.
Half of you to the west wing.
Half of you to the east wing.
The rest of you, come with me.
Oh, lighten up, Cogsworth
and let nature take its course.
It's obvious there's
a spark between them.
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames.
You know... a little.
Besides, they must fall in love
tonight if we ever expect
to be human again.
Ah, human again.
Human again.
Yes, think
what that means.
I'll be cooking again
Be good looking again
With a mademoiselle
on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again
Which should cause
several husbands alarm
Ha, ha!
I'll hop down off this shelf
And tout de suite be myself
I can't wait
to be human again
When we're human again
Only human again
When we're knickknacks
and whatnots no more
When we're human again,
good and human again
Oh, cherie,
won't it all be top drawer?
I'll wear lipstick and rouge
And I won't be so huge
Why, I'll easily fit
through that door
I'll exude savoir faire
I'll wear gowns,
I'll have hair
It's my prayer
to be human again
When we're human again
Only human again
When the world once more
starts making sense
I'll unwind, for a change
Really? That'd be strange
Can I help it
if I'm t-t-tense?
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back, sipping tea
Let my early
retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks
and relax!
When I'm human again
So sweep the dust
from the floor
Let's let some light
in the room
I can feel, I can tell
Someone might break the spell
any day now
Shine up the brass
on the door
Alert the dust pail
and broom
If it all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand
any day now
Open the shutters,
and let in some air
Put these here,
and put those over there
Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears
And throw them away
We'll be human again
Only human again
When the girl
finally sets us all free
Cheeks a-blooming again
We're assuming again
We'll resume our
long lost joie de vivre
We'll be playing again
Holidaying again
And we're praying
it's ASAP
We will push, we will shove
They will both fall in love
And we'll finally
be human again...
For never was a story
of more woe
Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.
Could you read it again?
Well, here, why don't
you read it to me?
Uh, all right.
Uh...
Uh... I can't.
You mean,
you never learned?
I learned... a little.
It's just been so long.
Well, here, I'll help you.
Let's start here.
Here.
Okay, "Twoe..."
"Two."
"Two... I knew that.
Two households..."
We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around
with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing
those old one, two, threes
We'll be floating again
We'll be gliding again
Stepping, striding
as fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn
And we're all
Human again!
Tonight is
the night.
I'm not sure I can do this.
You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.
Bold, daring.
There will be music...
romantic candlelight...
provided by myself.
And when the moment
is right
you confess your love.
Yes, I con...
I-I... No, I can't.
You care for the girl,
don't you?
More than anything.
Well, then,
you must tell her.
Voila!
Oh, you look so... so...
Stupid.
Not quite the word
I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more
off the top?
Your lady awaits.
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small, to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Shh!
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast.
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.
Good night, love.
Belle?
Are you... happy
here with me?
Yes.
What is it?
If only I could see
my father again
just for a moment.
I miss him so much.
There is a way.
This mirror will show
you anything...
anything
you wish to see.
I'd like to see
my father, please.
Papa?
Oh, no.
He's sick.
He may be dying
and he's all alone.
Then, you must go to him.
What did you say?
I release you.
You are no longer my prisoner.
You mean...
I'm free?
Yes.
Oh, thank you.
Hold on, Papa.
I'm on my way.
Take it with you
so you'll always have
a way to look back
and remember me.
Thank you for
understanding
how much he needs me.
Well, Your Highness,
I must say
everything is going
just swimmingly.
I knew you had it in you.
I let her go.
Yes, yes.
Splen...
You what?
How could you do that?
I had to.
Yes, but...
Why?
Because... I love her.
ALL:
He did what?
Yes.
I'm afraid it's true.
She's going away?
But he was so close.
After all this time
he's finally learned to love.
That's it, then.
That should break the spell.
But it's not enough.
She has to love him
in return.
COGSWORTH:
Now it's too late.
Papa! Papa!
Ooh.
They're back.
Belle?
Shh.
It's all right, Papa.
I'm home.
I thought I'd never
see you again.
I missed you so much.
but the Beast?
Did you...
How did you escape?
I didn't escape, Papa.
He let me go.
That horrible beast?
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.
Hi.
Oh. A stowaway.
Why, hello there, little fella.
Didn't think
I'd see you again.
Belle, why'd you go away?
Don't you like us anymore?
Oh, Chip, of course I do.
It's just...
May I help you?
I've come to collect
your father.
My father?
Don't worry, Mademoiselle.
We'll take good care of him.
My father's not crazy.
He was raving like a lunatic.
We all heard him, didn't we?
No, I won't let you.
Belle?
Maurice, tell us again, old man.
Just how big
was the beast?
He was... I mean, he was...
he was... enormous.
I-I'd say
at least eight...
No, more like ten feet.
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.
It's true, I tell you.
Get him
out of here.
Let go of me.
No!
You can't do this.
Poor Belle.
It's a shame
about your father.
You know he's
not crazy, Gaston.
Hmm, I might be able
to clear up this...
little misunderstanding.
lf...
If what?
If you marry me.
What?
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.
Never.
Have it your way.
Belle.
Let go of me.
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it.
Show me the Beast.
WOMAN:
Is it dangerous?
Oh, no, no, he'd
never hurt anyone.
Please, I know he looks vicious
but he's really
kind and gentle.
He's my friend.
If I didn't know better
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are.
She's as crazy
as the old man.
The Beast will make off
with your children.
- He'll come after them
in the night.
- No!
We're not safe
till his head
is mounted on my wall.
I say we kill the Beast!
We're not safe
until he's dead
He'll come stalking us
at night
Set to sacrifice
our children
To his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc
on our village
If we let him wander free
So it's time to take
some action, boys
It's time to follow me
Through the mist,
through the woods
Through the darkness
and the shadows
It's a nightmare,
but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something
truly terrible inside
It's a beast, he's got fangs,
razor-sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
Till he's dead
Good and dead
Kill the Beast!
No, I won't
let you do this.
If you're not with us,
you're against us.
Bring the old man.
Get your hands off me.
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.
Let us out!
We'll rid the village
of this beast.
Who's with me?
Raise your torch,
mount your horse
Screw your courage
to the sticking place
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way
Through the mist,
through the wood
Where,
within a haunted castle
Something's lurking
that you don't see every day
It's a beast,
one as tall as a mountain
We won't rest
till he's good and deceased
Sally forth, tally ho
Grab your sword,
grab your bow
Praise the lord,
and here we go.
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!
I have to warn the Beast.
This is all my fault.
Oh, Papa, what are
we going to do?
Now, now.
We'll think of something.
Ah!
We don't like
what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us
And this monster
is mysterious at least
Bring your guns,
bring your knives
Save your children
and your wives
We'll save our village
and our lives
We'll kill the Beast!
COGSWORTH:
I knew it.
I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.
Could it be?
Is it she?
Sacre bleu!
Invaders.
COGSWORTH:
Encroachers.
POTTS:
And they have
the mirror.
Warn the master.
If it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.
Who's with me?
Ah!
Take whatever booty
you can find
but remember,
the Beast is mine!
Lights ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid, although
the danger just increased
Raise the flag,
sing the song
Here we come,
we're 50 strong
And 50 Frenchmen
can't be wrong
Let's kill the Beast!
- Pardon me, Master?
- Leave me in peace.
But, sir, the castle
is under attack.
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!
This isn't working.
Oh, Lumiere,
we must do something.
Wait, I know.
What shall
we do, Master?
It doesn't matter now.
Just let them come.
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!
Now!
Yes!
Here we go.
What the devil?
Belle, look out!
You guys got to try this thing.
Up here
you scurvy scum! Now!
Oh!
And stay out!
Eww!
Get up.
Get up!
What's the matter, Beast?
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?
BELLE:
No!
Belle...
No! Gaston, don't!
Let's go, Philippe.
Come on out and fight!
Were you in love with her,
Beast?
Did you honestly think
she'd want you
when she had someone like me?
It's over, Beast.
Belle is mine!
Let me go. Let me go.
Please, don't hurt me.
I'll do anything.
Anything!
Get out.
Beast!
Belle?
Belle?
You came back.
You...
You came back.
Of course I came back.
I couldn't let them...
Oh, this is all my fault.
If only I'd gotten
here sooner.
Maybe... it's better...
it's better this way.
Don't talk like that.
You'll be all right.
We're together now.
Everything's
going to be fine.
You'll see.
And... at least...
I got to see you...
one last time.
No. No.
Please... Please...
Please, don't leave me.
I love you.
Belle.
It's me.
It is you.
Lumiere.
Cogsworth!
Mrs. Potts!
Look at us.
Mama, Mama.
My goodness.
It is a miracle.
L'amour.
Well, Lumiere,
old friend.
Shall we let bygones
be bygones?
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would
break the spell.
I beg your pardon,
old friend
but I believe
I told you.
No, you didn't--
I told you.
You most certainly
did not, you pompous
paraffin-headed
pea-brain.
En garde, you-you
overgrown pocket watch.
Take that.
Are they going to live
happily ever after, Mama?
Of course, my dear.
Of course.
Do I still have
to sleep in the cupboard?
Certain as the sun
