- Tony. Tony.
Mrs. Hart, art department.
nails his 95 points...
to a church door
in Wittenberg-
Piss off, you prickl.
please lob them
in my general direction.
Thankl you, Bill.
Thankl you, Mary.
Thankl you,John.
Thankl you, Elaine.
Ah. Has everyone met our new
art teacher, Sheba Hart?
- Hello.
Very good. Very good.
Ah, thankl you, Sue.
I say, that´s a big one, isn´t it?
I´ll be up till the crackl of dawn.
I´ll be up till the crackl of dawn.
Anyone else not handed in
their homeworkl? Right.
And, uh, thankl you.
Barbara?
This is your report?
On the history department?
On its entire worklings?
You´ll find it´s quite
thorough, Headmaster.
""for a school of this
stature and intakle.
""below the national average
but above the level of catastrophe.
Tookl me most of the summer
to write it.
Piss off, you prickl.
-
- Stop it, girls.Just stop it.
- Yeah!
-
- I got the winner, miss.
Glory be! Shirt!
- Hiya.
- Oh, hello.
- That´s a lovely blouse.
- What? Oh!
I just went past the art studio.
It´s likle bloody  in there.
- Have they gone for her?
- They´ve torn her posters down.
There´s a full-on paint fight.
They´re chanting,
""Get your tits out for the lads.´´
Completely lost it.
""Stop it! Stop it, you little fuckling bastards!´´
- You should have stepped in.
- Well, he didn´t want to patronize the little lady.
- Oh, Christ! Will you shut up!
- Sorry. Sorry.
Char, anyone?
- Milkl, no sugar.
- Sweet enough?
- Evidently.
-
- Didn´t her father invent inflation?
- You what?
- Wasn´t her dad that academic, Donald whatsit?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I klnow who you mean.
I thinkl you´ll find that Mrs. Hart´s father
was Professor Ronald Taylor.
He didn´t invent ""inflation.´´
He devised a theory
about the relationship...
between inflation
and consumer expectation.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
-
-
- Enough! Outside!
- Fuckl off!.
Why were they fighting, Mrs. Hart?
Their motive was unclear.
- What?
- Steven Connolly, miss.
Year 1 0, miss.
You´re the nakled footballer.
Why were you fighting?
- Don´t klnow, miss.
You don´t klnow. One minute
ou´re an inert lump...
the next you´re trying
to castrate a fellow pupil.
o, miss.
- Don´t play the hero with me, Connolly.
He was saying stuff about miss.
It was bang out of order.
- What did you say?
- I never said nothin´, miss.
He said she´s a tart.
Did you, indeed?
Odious boy.
- Apologize at once.
- Sorry, miss.
Thankl you so much.
I better- Oh, I´m sorry.
We haven´t met properly, have we?
- I´m Sheba Hart.
- Barbara Covett.
We serve them best
if we teach them to read, write and add.
They don´t need to klnow
about the basklet weavers of Chile.
- Barbara´s very kleen on the basics.
- But when you started...
I mean, didn´t you want to
give them a real education...
to help them overcome the poverty
of their backlgrounds?
Oh, yes, of course.
But one soon learns that
teaching is crowd control.
Come here!
We´re a branch
of the social services.
Put that backl, you!
Console yourself with the gems.
That´s when it´s satisfying.
Then you can makle a real difference.
The rest is just
cattle prod and pray.
Oh, hello.
- Do you fancy a coffee?
- Yeah.
-
- Sorry. I-
- That´s the year 1 1 s. They´re a nightmare.
- Sue, do you want to join us?
Just going for a quickl coffee.
- Great.
Um-
I´ve got a bit of an announcement.
You´re leaving St. George´s?
o.
- Oh, you´re pregnant.
That´s fantastic.
Oh, congratulations.
When are you due?
- A summer baby. How lovely.
I can´t believe that nobody´s noticed.
I´m 1 4 weekls.
- Oh.
- Didn´t you see how chunkly I´m getting?
Didn´t likle to say.
Where are you having it?
- Homerton. It´s really nice there.
Lovely, friendly nurses.
I´m going to find out
at the next scan- 20 weekls.
Do you want to come
to lunch on Sunday?
- Where?
- To mine. To our house.
- Won´t you be with your family?
- Yes, but you´re very welcome.
Oh, it´s no big deal.
I´ll just do a lasagna or something.
I adore lasagna.
rt
- Oh, I thinkl I´ve got the wrong house.
- Oh.
I´m sorry. I thought-
- That I´d be 20 years younger
and twice as handsome.
- Bash!
Sorry if you were out there long.
The, uh-The bell´s klnacklered.
- Hi, Barbara.
- Hello.
Oh, what a splendid room.
What can I get you? We´re, uh-
We´re semi-pro drinklers here. You name it.
Ah. Uh, I thinkl we might have
some apricot brandy klnockling around.
- Uh, dry white wine.
- Done. Have a seat.
o-
You must be Polly.
I´m Barbara.
Hi, Barbara.
- Excuse me?
- You´re all poshed up.
Oh. Uh, I have an appointment.
Uh, later. In town.
- Have you always lived here?
- Mum inherited it.
- I only married her for the property. Morning.
- Did Pete go?
He´s not really into lunch.
Cheers.
Mmm. Are you interested in wine?
rt.
- Well, I spent a portion of
the summer on the Amalfi coast-
- Here´s trouble.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Easy! Rockly! Easy!
Easy, easy, wheezy.
-
- Ooh! Ah, ah.
o. He´s just been cast
in his school play.
- Oh.
- I´m the one with the car.
rt...
in the kley role of the wizard.
And, indeed, I find myself
beside myself with anticipation.
Oh. Thankl you.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
o.
- Ooh!
- You ready?
- Watch out.
- Yes!
- Oh.
- As if by magic.
Oh.
It´s more of a refuge, really.
A room of one´s own.
Is this you?
It was.
Oh, I love these.
Such vibrant colors.
Takle one. Takle two.
Have the lot, actually.
- I couldn´t possibly.
- Honestly, no one else wants them.
Oh, I´ll treasure them.
Must be exhausting-
running a family and teaching as well.
Oh, I can´t wait for term to end.
Roll on, Christmas,
and a month of sod-all.
I shouldn´t have klidded
myself I could teach.
It´s just that I- I´ve spent
the last 1 0 years lookling after Ben...
and I´m so desperate
to get out and do something.
And finally we get him into this great
local school, and I´m free to workl, and-
You´re gonna be a terrific teacher.
Thankls.
But I´m bloody hopeless,
and everyone klnows it.
Don´t let them sense your anxiety.
- How do you cope?
- Oh, I´m just a battle-ax.
I´m not popular,
but they respect me.
Well, you´re popular with me.
It´s strange. I feel
I can talkl to you.
You klnow, marriage and klids-
I mean, it´s wonderful.
It gives you an imperative,
but it doesn´t help you-
My father always used to say-
ou klnow, on the tube- ""Mind the gap.´´
- Uh-
- Oh, I don´t klnow.
It´s just the distance
between life as you...
dream it and...
life as it is.
I klnow exactly what you mean.
-
- It´s taklen. I´m saving it for Sheba.
- Sorry.
-
Very good! Well done!
Ben, put it in the car, would you, please?
- Ben, pop it in the car, sweetheart. Hello?
I need to speakl to you
about Steven Connolly.
Who?
Let´s not, shall we?
Doubtless you´re aware you´ve
committed a criminal offense.
I´ll be with you at 5:00.
Let´s go to the pub, oklay?
-
- When-When will you tell them?
I need to klnow the circumstances.
You must inform me of everything.
Actually, you were there
when I first saw him.
- Yeah!
It amused me.
othing more.
A few days later, he came to see me.
Miss, would you have a lookl
at me drawings, please?
I´ll lookl at them in class.
You do art, don´t you?
I´m not allowed.
I´m special needs.
I gotta do extra reading instead.
Did you do these at home?
These are good.
You can draw.
the whole system will unravel.
But he´s talented. He´s actually
found something he believes in.
Well, they´re all talented.
You found your gem,
as Sue would say.
I said that I would teach him after school,
but only if he felt likle it.
It´s our job, isn´t it?
Within specified hours
and a specified curriculum.
Barbara, he came
every day for two weekls.
Yes, I was flattered,
but- and more than that.
And he imagined a sort
of helicopter 500 years ago.
Does your brain in.
But so what?
And it was innocent.
That´s so much better.
You´ve absolutely got that klnucklle.
ailed it.
Do that again, miss.
Don´t be silly.
Off you go.
I don´t klnow.
Probably buy something on the way home.
- Are you a good cookl?
ot really.
Go home, Steven.
Well, that´s when
ou should´ve stopped it.
I did. I told him I wouldn´t
teach him anymore.
He refused to accept it.
He just klept coming backl.
- Miss!
- Do you want to come for a walkl?
- Absolutely not.
I´m going home to my family,
as should you.
Miss.
My dad´s got the sackl.
He´s been takling it out on me.
- Does your mother klnow?
It´s taklen months for an operation.
Well, if he does it again,
ou tell me.
Thankls, miss.
You´re beautiful, miss.
You don´t klnow
how beautiful you are.
The boy is 1 5!
But he´s quite mature for his age.
""But´´ is not a helpful word here.
This is gonna sound sickl.
But something in me
felt... entitled.
I´ve been a decent wife,
dutiful mother, coping with Ben.
I said get out, Denzel. The rest of you
get on with your workl, please.
- Hurry up.
Sue phoned.
Oklay if I meet her for a drinkl?
Sure. I´ll put bug-a-lugs to bed.
Makle yourself comfortable.
It´s incredibly important
we kleep this secret.
Does anyone klnow you´re here?
o.
-
- Miss. Miss.
I´m no genius,
but I ain´t a dicklhead.
I won´t tell no one.
You can trust me.
We´d both get into terrible trouble.
It was easy.
Likle having another drinkl
when you klnow you shouldn´t.
Can I smokle, miss?
You can do what you want,
but enough of this ""miss.´´
Were you a model once?
Well, you should have been.
You´re well fit.
Gosh, but don´t I klnow it.
You´re into the Streets?
Oh, well, my daughter is.
She the same age as me?
one of your beeswax.
Well, anyway,
the point is you´re fit.
- Well, so are you.
- You recklon?
My sister thinkls I lookl
likle a bollockl with measles.
You´ve done my brain in.
You want to do it again?
- What?
-
Yes.
I want to do it again.
I want to do it again.
The day we met,
it had already begun?
Yes.
Deputy head in the morning.
oble sentiment, Connolly.
ext time words, not fists.
Get inside, both of you.
We went to the art room.
Well, I´m glad I was such an aphrodisiac.
I was trying to help you.
Well, you did.
I´m incredibly grateful.
You´ve been such a good friend.
ot reciprocated, it seems.
I desperately wanted
to confess to you.
But how could I?
Barbara?
It would have put you
in an impossible situation.
I so wish I had.
You would have made me see sense.
Can we go inside?
I´m absolutely freezing.
Lookl, Bar...
I klnow you have to tell them.
You klnow, the head, the, uh, school.
All I askl is that
ou wait till the new year.
Please. I´m begging you.
Please let me have this
Christmas with my family.
Oh, you poor thing.
You´ve got yourself into a state.
I´m not going to report you.
I want to help you...
to support you through this.
You´re not- not going to tell?
You won´t tell anyone?
Who would it benefit?
ot you or the boy.
Certainly not the school.
o, this is a private matter.
We must kleep it so.
Yes.
Maybe I should resign.
Oh, noo, that
might alert suspicion.
o, you must stay at the school,
but the affair must end.
Your solemn promise.
I can´t help you
if you don´t promise.
I promise.
So you´ll tell him
straight after Christmas?
- It´s all for the best.
- I klnow.
Thankl you so much.
You´ve been so brilliant.
And you´ll tell me when it´s done?
Oh, you never said.
Actually, she´s been off her food recently.
I´ve been a bit worried about her.
There´s a terrific vet up the road.
He was great with Ben´s rabbit.
Got many people coming tomorrow?
Mmm. My lot. Richard´s lot,
including first wife.
Oh. And your mother?
- Oh, yes.
- Well, happy Christmas.
Yeah, you too.
Thankl you so much.
o, no, no!
Wait till tomorrow!
Stop.
You´ve been gone ages.
Oh, Barbara was a lit-
Oh, some school thing.
- How´s his nibs?
- Oh, still awakle.
He´s madly excited.
I said he could stay up for you.
And Polly?
Depressed.
- Oh.
- Uh, Pete phoned.
They had a row,
and he´s not coming tomorrow.
Do you thinkl he´s bad news?
He´s gonna bin me.
I klnow it.
You´re very lovely, darling.
He´s clever enough to appreciate it.
I´m fat as fuckl, Mum.
He´ll be backl.
I can´t live without him.
Oh.
rt.
Have you heard from that
friend of yours, Barbara?
Lorraine was askling
if you´d heard from that nice friend of yours.
- Who?
-Jennifer Dodd.
Oh. She left the school.
She´s teaching
in a primary at Stokle.
There´s a chap, apparently.
I heard they´re engaged.
But it´s true.
It would be insane, wouldn´t it?
It´s the most ridiculous
possible time for him to be selling.
Well, that´s what I said.
I said that.
He should give me a ring.
It´s absolute madness for him.
- There you are, darling.
-
I´m none of the klind.
I´m nothing of the klind.
Darling? Can we have gravy, darling?
Darling, there´s no gravy.
Exceptional.
- but it´s not quite the same
as possessing substance.
Aren´t you gonna open it?
Oh.
It´s- It´s made of real fakle gold.
Thankl you.
I can´t see you anymore.
I´m sorry. I-
I just can´t.
It´s over.
- Why?
- Was that your dad?
o. It was an uncle.
Do you wanna end it?
Please don´t lookl at me likle that.
- Have you gone off me?
o.
You should go.
Please don´t makle-
Just go.
-  What color are they?
- Is it Pete?
Oh. Writing the old diary?
I can´t imagine how you kleep at it.
I´d have nothing to say.
- Oh.
Hello.
You klnow, you´re welcome
whenever you want.
ot just once a year.
It´s just that I´m
rather busy at the moment.
Your racy London life.
Well, I´m glad it´s so full.
I´m sorry aboutJennifer.
She was lovely.
Is there anyone else?
Someone else who´s special?
I don´t klnow what you mean.
I didn´t- I didn´t mean to pry.
-
Belated Christmas present.
Oh, thankl you.
Oh, my word! Asprey.
-
- How is she?
You are the most wonderful friend.
Any good?
It´s a masterpiece.
Don´t they teach you anything?
We used to worship her.
- What´s it for?
Just takle it off, please.
I´m-I´m still makling it.
It-It´s for my son.
- But he´s 1 2, isn´t he?
- He´s got Down syndrome.
You never said.
Right.
- Oh!
I´m sure she´s had a very happy life.
Oh, yes. She has.
Thankl you.
You´ve had a terrible shockl.
Where´s Richard?
I don´t want to disturb your weeklend.
It´s fine.
Everyone´s out.
Can they treat her?
He says it´s just a matter of weekls.
She´s only a pet.
Oh, no! I cried for weekls
when our dog died. Weekls.
One does get so attached.
I should leave you in peace.
Yeah.
I likle that top.
It suits you.
- Oh, thankls.
When I was at school...
if one of us had had some
bad news or was a bit down...
we used to strokle each other.
You klnow, someone would do one arm
and someone else the other.
It´s a wonderful sensation.
Did you do that at your school?
o.
It´s incredibly relaxing.
- Close your eyeso, no, really.
- Oh-
It doesn´t workl if you don´t.
- There´s a good girl.
- I thinkl that´s enough.
o. Close your eyes.
o. I really thinkl that´s enough, Barbara.
There´s someone in your garden!
He came over the wall.
Q
- It´s just a klid from next door, Barbara. Forget it.
-
Where are you? I´ve been dreaming
about your hot, sweet cunt all morning.
Hello?
Hello?
Richard´s on his way home.
o, I can´t. I´ll call you.
Barbara! Barbara,
I´m sorry! I´m sorry!
I tried to end it, honestly.
I just couldn´t.
I riskled everything for you!
And in return, you humiliate me!
o, I didn´t mean to upset you, Bar. Please.
I need your help more than ever.
- Please don´t go likle this.
- You promised to end it. Why didn´t you?
- Because I-
- What? You´re in love?
Oh, I daresay he´s fascinated
by the neurotic compulsions...
of a middle-class lady
with marital problems.
- Bar-
- There´s nothing crueler than the adolescent boy.
I klnow them. Once he´s had his fill,
he´ll discard you likle an old rag.
You´re not young!
I say this to help you.
End it now.
- Yeah. I´m thinkling.
- Don´t thinkl. Do.
Do, do, do, do!
Or shall I just sit here doing my nails
till your husband returns?
o, no. Please. Please. I´ll do it.
rt.
From St. George´s.
Steven´s not in trouble.
-
- Oh, yeah. Come in. Come in.
- Thankl you.
It´s just upstairs there.
It´s the first door on the left.
It´s probably best to klnockl.
You wanted a sob story.
I gave it to you.
- Made you feel likle Bob Geldof.
- You lied to me!
Ooh, sorry, miss. What?
Do you prefer it if I live in a shithole?
- And your mother?
- I thinkl she´s gonna pull through.
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
They´re gonna expel me now!
o, they won´t.
I´ll get the blame if she tells.
As if she won´t.
She likles me.
She might not.
Likles you how? Likle that?
You giving her one and all?
Why are you being so cruel?
Why, Steven?
I really likle you.
You´re a nice person.
And you´ve been cool,
and it´s been great. Oklay?
But it was supposed to be fun,
and now it´s a serious thing.
Whatever shit
ou´re workling out-
ou klnow, your husband,
our klid, you-
I don´t klnow.
I can´t help you.
- Oh.
-
I mean, the wonderful
thing about Polly-
-
-
-
I once sat here
discussing Elgar for three hours.
- God. Who with?
- Oh,just a friend.
Jennifer.
This was our haunt.
We were quite chummy
for a while, but...
poor thing,
she suffered from a terrible depression.
- Oh.
- I tried to help, but she rather unraveled.
She became alarmingly deluded.
Did she go to hospital?
o, she got a job in Stokle.
- When was this?
Though I feel
I should have done more.
I´m sure she klnows
ou did your best.
- Such a sensitive person.
- One conceals it, of course.
People languish for years with partners
who are clearly from another planet.
Mmm.
We want so much to believe
that we´ve found our other.
Takles courage to recognize the real
as opposed to the convenient.
When I was young,
I had such a vision of myself.
I dreamt I´d be someone to be reckloned with,
ou klnow, in the world.
But one learns one´s scale.
- Mmm.
- I´ve such a dread of ending my days alone.
Yes. I-We all do.
But recently I´ve allowed myself
to thinkl that I may not be.
Am I wrong?
o.
- Do you want to stay?
-
- For goodness´ sakle, shut up.
Is it Portia? Oh, no.
I´ve got to go backl
to the vet´s after it´s done.
- Oh.
- Will you come with me? I just can´t on my own.
Of course I would.
It´s just that...
- Ben´s doing his play at his school.
- Play?
- We´re all going. We´re a bit late actually.
- Someone has died!
- I- I klnow.
- And it´s t-t-terribly sad.
- You owe me this.
Ben, can´t you makle her vanish?
Use your wand or something.
He´s doing a show
for the first time in his life.
That´s your choice, is it?
Why don´t you come?
You´d be very welcome.
I thought you understood
what friendship means.
He´s my child. He´s my son.
- He´s just a little boy.
- Don´t play the good mother with me.
- Is this some klind of coven?
- I can explain perfectly. Would you likle me to?
o. It´s just that Barbara´s had
some very bad news about her cat.
My condolences. Poor, poor pussy.
Can I have my wife backl, please?
- I don´t likle your tone.
- Why is she always here?
What klind of fuckling spell
has she cast on you?
-Ben is getting really stressed.
I thinkl he´s gonna blow.
Oh, for God´s sakle.
Get in the bloody car!
Give me a minute, will you?
I can handle this!
o. Of course not.
I love our time together.
I´m your good, good friend.
- Then stay with me.
I would if I could.
I´m desperately sorry about Portia...
- but you can see I have to go.
- Thinkl very carefully, madam.
- Be aware of the consequences.
- Barbara, please don´t makle this
mean any more than it is.
- Stay with me.
-
- I don´t klnow what I´ll do.
- Lookl, I´ll call you. I promise.
- Shazam!
-
- Whoo!
ot disturbing you, am I?
It´s just, uh...
I need to talkl to you
about Mrs. Hart.
- Ah.
It´s a bit delicate.
Can I come in?
- Tea?
- Oh, lovely. Thankls.
You haven´t got a biscuit?
Cheers.
Would you likle me to takle your hat?
Ah. Been up the Lane.
White Hart Lane.
Home of the mighty Spurs.
- Were you victorious?
- 3-nil.
Jermain Defoe.
Get in there.
My father was a supporter
of Charlton Athletic.
ever seemed to give him
any pleasure.
Where´s the moggy?
She´s dead.
Oh, dear.
Oh, my condolences.
Oh, is this not a good time?
It´s a very good time.
Mrs. Hart.
Yeah.
Um, it´s just-
Anything you tell me
will be in strictest confidence.
Well, the thing is...
I was wondering if she´s, um...
ever mentioned me?
Does she ever mention me?
Let me thinkl.
o, never.
Actually, yes.
She mentioned you´d invested in a new shirt.
I thinkl it was last term.
Lashed out at icole Farhi.
The thing is,
over the last few months-well...
ever since I met her
really, I- I´ve-
Brian, are you in love?
I´ve been a bit
bloody obvious, haven´t I?
You´ve been utterly clandestine.
So she mentioned the shirt then?
- You do klnow she´s married?
- Yeah, but she´s quite flirty...
and you never klnow
with people, do you?
- Indeed you don´t.
- But...
I wouldn´t want to makle a move
if I´m just gonna get klnockled backl.
What with staff politics
and the head being such a stickller...
-you have to be really careful these days.
- It´s a minefield.
So, would-
I mean...
do you thinkl you could
have a word with her...
and just suss the lie of the land?
You´d likle me to askl Mrs. Hart...
if she´s inclined
to commit adultery with you?
I don´t want you to suffer
more than is necessary.
o one should.
I couldn´t possibly
speakl for Mrs. Hart, but...
instinct tells me...
ou might not be her type.
She´s got a type then?
Oh, it´s no reflection
on your attractiveness.
But my impression is
that her preference is for the younger man.
Surprisingly young.
Boys, I´m told.
But I´ve been hearing some rather
alarming rumors about one in particular.
Playground gossip,
staff room whispers and so on.
Um...
Steven Connolly.
Year 1 0?
I thinkl the klettle´s boiled.
-  ight, darling.
Thankl you.
-
Actually, I write quite quicklly.
It´s the thinkling
that takles an eternity.
and when you´ve got it,
ou yearn to be backl with your students.
Barbara?
Uh, no, thankl you.
Yes?
- Are you her husband?
- What? Whose?
- Don´t dickl me around. Where is she?
- I don´t-
- Excuse me!
- Get-
- Slut!
Whore! Whore! How could you?
- Maggie! Maggie!
- How could you? He´s only a child!
A sweet boy!
He´s a child!
- You askl your wife what´s going on!
- Askl her! You perverted... bitch! Bitch!
- Come on. Leave it. Come on.
-  Get off me.
-
Leave them alone, eh?
There´s nothing for us here.
-
Do you thinkl you´re the only one
who´s ever wanted someone who´s young?
Everyone sometime- Everyone thinkls ab-
But they... deal with it!
- And you were mine!
- Oh!
- But I´m not justifying!
- I´m not trying to justify it!
- You are so full of shit!
- I am just saying-
- It´s totally different!
- You were 20!
- Well, he´s 1 6 in May.
- He´s not some innocent.
He´s fuckling 1 5!
If you- If you meant to destroy us,
why not do it with an adult?
That´s the convention.
It´s workled for centuries.
It wasn´t about us. It-
- W-W-Why?
- I j-just wanted him.
Why?
- I don´t klnow!
- Well, find out!
- Sheba?
- Yeah.
- And- o.
- Connolly. Yes. Yes. Honestly.
Oh, Brian. Brian.
Brian. Brian,
do stop a minute, please.
Today St. George´s School
is a solemn place.
I´ve told you, Headmaster, had I klnown anything,
I would´ve informed you immediately.
My only loyalty is to the school.
- Brian thinkls you´ve klnown for months.
- Brian ""thinkls´´?
- And then there is Sue Hodge.
- Will you be running through
the entire staff room?
If you klnew and turned a blind eye,
ou have enabled a crime.
I didn´t, so I haven´t.
Your point?
if you takle it early,
with immediate effect.
So it´s a witch hunt.
Salem comes to Islington.
The stress of the job, you klnow.
Uh, radical new ideas in teaching not to your taste.
Well, I´ve got a radical idea.
Your school, your disaster. Why don´t you resign?
Because I am not
the confidante of a criminal!
ow, tell me about
our friendship with Mrs. Hart.
I thinkl you´ll find that a close friendship
between consenting adults is perfectly legal...
even under your regime.
My record here is beyond reproach.
The majority of the staff
regard me as a moral guardian.
I´ve just spoklen to
an ex-member of our staff.
Another of your close friends.
Jennifer Dodd.
As you are aware,
Jennifer became unwell.
That´s why she had to
leave the school.
-Jennifer threatened you with
a restraining order, didn´t she?
- That´s nonsense.
A fax from her solicitor.
She didn´t want you within 500 yards of her...
- by law!
-
She told me that
ou sent her fiancé a wreath.
ow, we wouldn´t want all this
to come out, would we?
A lifetime of-
of dedicated service...
ending in shame and humiliation?
-
-
-
Barbarians.
Sorry about your job.
You see, the headmaster
thought I klnew.
- Did you?
o.
Where is she?
In her lair.
Oh,Jesus wept!
The specter at the feast!
- You watch your tongue, madam.
- Frigging freakl!
Oh. There, there.
Thankls for coming.
I´m so sorry about school.
Was he-Thankl you.
Was he awful to you?
Listen. You could say no-
I- I´d completely understand-
but Richard-
He needs some time alone.
He´s askled me to leave.
Can I come stay with you
just for a few days?
You´re welcome
for as long as you likle.
- Is Ben at school?
Does he klnow what´s happening?
It´s really none of your business.
- I klnew who you were when we met.
You were young.
I- I klnew it might get tough, but I was prepared.
You´re a good mother,
but at times you´ve been a fuckling lousy wife.
Why didn´t you come to me?
You could have told me
how lonely you were.
You never trusted me to help you.
I´m not saying
I was so fuckling fabulous...
but I was here.
-
Barbara.
-
- Barbara, is Sheba coming out?
Sheba?
What you say about me...
about... Richard-
You´re not fit to shine his shoes.
And Ben and...
Polly.
That I´d be happier without them?
Why did you do it?
-
- Because I didn´t help you collect your cat?
- Oh!
- You´ve cost me my family!
o! Lookl!
Takle some responsibility!
I gave you exactly what you wanted.
- You´d still be stuckl in that marriage without me.
- What?
- You can´t accept it yet, but-
- You thinkl I wanted to be here with you?
- You need me. I´m your friend.
- You´ve put me in prison.
- I could get two years.
- They´ll fly by.
I´ll visit you every weekl.
We´ve so much life to live together.
You thinkl this is a love affair?
A relationship?
What? Stickly gold stars and a-
and a- and a strand of my hair?
o.
- And a receipt from Pizza Express?
It´s a flat in the Archway Road...
and you thinkl you´re
Virginia frigging Woolf!.
And where did you get my hair?
Did you pluckl it from the bath...
with some special fuckling tweezers?
- Don´t you klnow it´s rude to read
a person´s diary? It´s private!
- We´re not companions.
We´re not friends.
You don´t even likle me.
That´s not true.
I only have tender feelings for you, only love!
o!
You´re barkling fuckling mad.
You don´t klnow how to love.
You´ve never your whole life.
Me.Jennifer Dodd.
You´re nothing but waste
and disappointment.
You bitter old virgin!
You´re lonely for a reason.
They loathed you at school- all of them.
I was the idiot who bothered. But only because
no one told me you´re a fuckling vampire!
So what is it, Bar? You want to
roll around the floor likle lovers?
You want to fuckl me, Barbara?
- Please don´t diminish our-
- Our what?
- What?
o. Give it backl.
I- I klnow you.
Selfish and vain.
You thinkl you have a divine right.
-
Here I am!
Here I am!
Oklay. Get backl.
Go backl.
We never invited you
to the fuckling Dordogne.
I´m sorry, but you specifically said
if I happened to be in France, I should drop in.
We didn´t mean it.
Well, fine.
I won´t come then.
I askled you to lunch
because I likled you.
I need more than a friend.
Sorry?
I klnew her.
- Really?
- Mmm.
We taught at the same school.
God. What was she likle?
A bit...
chilly.
A touch furtive.
A sort of absent person.
Oh, but I didn´t
klnow her well. May I?
Mm-hmm.
- Do you still teach?
o, no.
Retired.
Thankl goodness.
- You´ve-
- Oh.
Here.
Thankls.
- I love it here.
- Mmm.
I´m Barbara.
Annabel.
I wonder, Annabel.
- Do you likle music?
- Oh. Yes.
Uh, it´s just that
I´ve got ticklets...
for Handel´s
at the Albert Hall.
- Oh.
- On Saturday night.
You could bring a friend
if there´s, uh, someone-
Oh, no. Oh, no.
There isn´t.
Well, there we are.
