大家都走了
Everyone's gone man.
噢 你们在这儿
Yo, there he is!
终于到户外活动了啊 老人家
You lasted pretty long out there, old man.
噢 我的老哥与长板
My big bro on a longboard.
从没想过会有这么一天
Never thought I'd see the day.
是吗 过个十年你再跟我说这句
Give me 10 years and call me back about that.
是吗 我从没滑过长板
Yeah, right. I'll never be on a longboard. Ever.
我都感到难为情
Alright, I'm getting beers.
怎样 宝贝?
What's up, babe?
Sean 你!
Shaun...
Sean 收敛些
Shaun, just chill.
嘿 Cods
Hey, Codes.
怎么了？
What's wrong?
Cody 你先回房间待会儿
Cody, go to your room for a second.
告诉我你只是有些困惑
Please tell me that he's just confused.
什么意思？
What do you mean?
Zach 为什么你不跟我说？
Zach, why didn't you tell me?
说什么？
Tell you what?
Ok 你的困惑是一回事
Ok, your confusion is one thing...
但把Cody也牵扯进来就太操蛋了
But bringing Cody into this is just totally fucked.
我没把他牵扯到任何里面!
I didn't bring him to anything!
－你带他去见Sean!You brought him to Shaun!
－他喜欢Sean!He likes Shaun!
Sean好过那个...
Shaun's better than...
不说那个了 不关Sean的事这是关于我们
You know what, forget it.It's not about Shaun, it's about us.
关于我们家
It is about our family.
有什么关系?
What about it?
Cody失去了父亲 他需要你 他需要一个正面的男人做楷模
Cody lost his father. He needs you. He needs a positive man in his life.
对不起 我不是Allen
I'm sorry I'm no Allen.
你什么都不懂 他只是个孩子
You don't know shit. He's a little kid.
他不会明白你那些
He's not gonna understand this.
在经过他妈的这么几年后?
You mother of the fucking year now?
噢 去你妈的
Oh fuck you.
没有我你早成什么样了
He'd be lost without me!
去你妈的 Zach
Fuck you, Zach!
Zach 你想把这个家搞垮么？
Zach, are you trying to fuck up our family?
是啊 Jeanne 这就是我想做的
Yeah, Jeanne.That's what I'm trying to do.
要知道Cody是因为我才知道什么叫家的
You know? Cody has a sense of family because of me.
妈妈死后我遗传了那该死的基因
Mom died and I got the family fucking gene.
哦 是家里的基因让你在外面搞同志的？
Oh, I see. So it's the 'family' gene that's making
you run off and have your big gay wedding?
你让这个家感到骄傲了?
You gonna make the family proud?
你在害怕什么?
Is that what you're scared of?
这跟Sean或者我无关
This isn't about Shaun, or me.
这是关于你被抛弃
This is about you being left.
而我是唯一没扔下你不管的人
I'm the only one who hasn't run off on you.
真贴心啊
Sweet.
继续啊 继续羞辱我啊
But go ahead, judge me.
我无所谓 你说对了
I don't care. You know? You're right.
没错 男人一个个抛弃我
Yeah, guys have left me.
但是Zach 现在你完全就是个混球
But, Zach, now you are just a Summer fuck, ok?
你跑去干男人的屁眼 好棒啊
You've reduced yourself to a little piece of ass
你对自己真不错啊
so, bravo! You are doing really well for yourself.
你有想过这会给他带来什么吗?
Do you think that is a good upbringing for him?
-我有Yes.
-有吗？ Do you?
不 我不知道 不知道
No, I don't know.
如果你有想过 你觉得会需要对我对Gabe 对Tori隐瞒么？
Well... if it is do you think you'd have to hide it from me, from Gabe, from Tori?
不 不 我不知道 行了吗?
I don't know!I don't fucking know, ok?
我只想知道什么对Cody最好
I just want what's best for Cody.
我也是
Well so do I!
对不起
Sorry.
上帝
Oh God.
嘿
Hey.
我需要点时间
I need some time.
我不知道这是不是我想要的
I just don't know if this is really what I want.
看上去像是你想要的
Seems like what you want.
我不知道这个...
I just don't know if this is what I want.
可不可以持久
For good.
这是什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?
这对我并不像你那样轻松
It's not as easy for me as it is for you.
我对这完全陌生
You know, this is all totally new to me.
我们可以搞定Gabe...
We'll get through the Gabe thing...
不 不是那个 Sean
No it's not that, Shaun.
你不明白
You just don't get it, ok?
我不能要什么就提出什么 I can't just take whatever I want.
我的生活不是那样 My life is not like that.
你永远不知道要什么 除非你提出来
You'll never get what you want unless you take it.
提出来?
Take it...
你和Gabe习惯了指着什么提要求You and Gabe have always been able to point and take.
当然没问题No questions asked.
你不懂别人的生活不是那样  这真他妈的无知
You don't realize it's not like that for other people.It's fucking ignorant.
噢 那你和Jeanne就整天埋怨别人 因为你没法替自己着想?
Oh and you and Jeanne just blame everyone elsebecause you can't do anything for yourselves?
你管这叫什么?
What do you call that?
听我说 操
Look... fuck!
你干嘛这么对自己?
Why are you doing this?
因为我是个情绪化的同志 Ok?
Don't go all emotional and faggy on me, ok?
什么?
What?
我厌恶了做你的梦中情人 Sean
I'm sick of being your childhood wet dream, Shaun.
你另外找人性幻想去
Find another fucking fantasy!
知道吗 你是他妈的懦夫
You know what? You're a fucking coward!
我说完了
I'm done.
你是懦夫
You're a fucking coward.
我说完了
I'm done.
出去!
Get out!
我们打烊了
We're closed!
怎么了 老兄
What's up, bro?
好啊 伙计
Good, brother.
妈的 我酒现在还没醒
I'm so hungover...
厨房收了 要不要来杯咖啡？
Kitchen's closed.Do you want a coffee?
好 谢谢
Yes, please.
你还好吧
So what's up?
你没说一声就走了 昨晚没见你离开
I'm taking off later today.Never saw you leave last night.
-那么...So...
-那么?So?
为什么你不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?
告诉你什么
Tell you what?
我不介意 一点也不
I don't care... at all.
我不懂你说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.
你一直...都知道吗?
Have you always known?
说真的 伙计
Seriously, dude.
Ok
Ok.
其实上是我老哥怪的离谱
The fact that it's my brother is totally weird.
我知道
I know.
不 就是…
No, like...
是很怪很怪那种
really really fucking weird.
好了 我懂了 对不起
Alright, I got it.I'm sorry.
别说对不起
Don't be sorry.
别告诉别人 好吗?
Don't tell anyone, ok?
好
Ok.
这么说你有过其他男人了?
So are you going with other guys?
不是
No!
听说他们口技更好 他们口技是不是更好?
I heard they give better head.They give better head, don't they?
伙计 别说了
Dude, stop!
-他们做深喉吗?Do they swallow?
-Gabe
门外那个性感吗？
Do you think he's hot?
给我他妈闭嘴!
Shut the fuck up, dude!
好吧
Fine.
-那么 你昨晚去哪儿了So, where'd you go last night?
-睡我车里了I slept in my car.
你为什么不来我家?
Why didn't you just crash at mine?
这不一定改变什么
This doesn't have to change things.
不会改变什么? 你说得对 Gabe
Doesn't change things?You're right, Gabe.
我是你之前倾吐的对象 记得吗?
I used to be the guy you came and talked to, remember?
在Sean之前?
Before Shaun.
这对我来讲也不轻松
This isn't exactly easy on me.
你不轻松 没错
This isn't easy on you, right?
算了 已经结束就别再提了
You know what? It's over anyway.So just leave it, dude.
我还要收拾 你得走了
I've gotta clean up and you've gotta leave.
我们还是兄弟对吗?
Hey, we're still bros, alright?
我说真的
I mean it.

Come here.
我能进来蹭一晚吗?
Can I please just come in and crash?
Jeanne

Zachy, what are you doing?They turned you down.
为什么还要再经历一回?
Why do you wanna put yourself through that again?
只是想再给自己一次机会 知道吗?
I just thought I'd give it another shot, you know?
别费神了 那里到处是有钱小孩画画最后通过关系摆进艺术店铺里面
Well don't bother. That place is full of rich kid painters
and they're all gonna end up working at art stores anyway.
是啊 可能吧
Yeah, maybe.
海洋馆招人 要我帮你说句好话吗?
They're hiring at the Ocenette.Do you want me to put in a good word?
这工作不错啊
It's a good job.
-有钱进账We could use the money.
-好吧
为什么我们再也没见到Sean了？
How come we never see Shaun anymore?
有时候就这样 Cody 人们离开
Sometimes that happens, Cody.People leave sometimes.
他们为什么要离开?
Why did he leave?
很复杂 大人的事
It's complicated. A grown-up thing.
就算他离开 我们还能跟他打招呼吗？Can we say hi to him even though he left?
他好酷哦He was cool.
不 有时人走了就再也不回来
No.Sometimes people leave and never come back.
