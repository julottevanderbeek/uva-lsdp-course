Victorious S03E01 The Breakfast Bunch
well,this is a great way to spend a Saturday.
I have never had detention before.
I'm kind of nervous.
if you hadn't made us late for class,
We wouldn't be here.
I was choking on a pretzel!
well, why do you always gotta be chokin' on something'?
ah,give him a break.
yeah, it's not robbie's fault
He has a petite throat.
it's average!
hey,who's in charge of detention anyway?
vice principal--
Dickers.
mornin' waz-bags.
Detention is that way --
In the library.
Get ready for the worst day of your lives.
yay!
We're at school on a Saturday!
Ha ha ha ha...
library!
okay.
geez.
calm down.
well,well.
It's 7:06 a.M. here in los angeles.
That means in australia, it's yesterday.
Or tomorrow.
You know, in Australia.
When you flash the toilet, the water swirls backwdsds.
Put a socket in, alfro. You clowns are gonna sit here
all day and think about why you're in detention.
- Now, cellphones, let's have them.  - Why?
Because in detentions, there are no phone calls.
- What about texting?  - No!
- Email?  - No!
- Can we play grumpy gerbils?  - I love grumpy gerbils.
I can't get pass level twenty-three.
- Sip it, corn pie! - Can we have corn pie?
Shut up! Phones!
Now, I'm gonna put your box of phones right here.
What, princess?
I am just wondering what the plan is for lunch.
Well, if you pretends to get hungry,
There's a big plane of tuna right here.
Uh,techinically sir. If perishable foods aren't kept
either below 34 degrees or above 140 degrees--
Pipe outside, salad.
Eat the tuna or starve. I can care less.
um,I think you mean you couldn't care less.
what's that?
You said you could care less
which implies that you do care.
At least a little bit.
I don't.
well,then you should've said you couldn't care less.
but you did not.
Hey, what about the guy who first landed on the moon?
He said "One small step for man."
I wanna just say "Oh my god, I'm on the moon!"
All right, not another word.
Word.
That's it, West.
You just bought yourself for another Saturday detention.
did I get a good deal on it?
You just bought yourself another one!!!
Look, I am sorry. I apologize.
That's three. Three saturdays.
But she was apologizing.

Why?

I really don't.
That's four. You want five?

Anybody else? Huh?
Anybody? You mess with the cow...
You get the udders.

Tacos do sound really good right now.
- Put up for tacos.  - yeah, I love tacos.
Look who's been reeeaaal quiet.
I am just not that hungry right now.

- Leave me alone.  - What's goin' on here?
Our pristine little friend cat has never had a taco.

- And unfriend you.  -Oh really?
Two clicks. One to unfriend you.
And one to confirm that I am really wanna unfriend you.
