What's it gonna be, Angelina?
It was Grogan...
the filthiest, dirtiest,
dumbest excuse for a man...
west of the Missouri River.
Now, you can die
two ways, angel.
Quick like the tongue
of a snake...
or slower than
the molasses in January.
But it was October.
I'll kill you, God damn it,
if it's the Fourth of July!
Where is it?
Get over there.
I told him to get out...
now that he had
what he came for.
Not quite, Angel.
Take 'em off.
Do it!
Come on!
Aah!
That was the end of Grogan...
the man who killed my father,
raped and murdered my sister...
burned my ranch, shot my dog,
and stole my Bible!
But if there was one law
of the West...
bastards had brothers...
who seemed to ride forever.
But suddenly, there he was,
my beloved Jesse.
He was the one man I trusted--
the only man.
My heart leapt
as I watched him ride near.
I could barely wait to feel
the warmth of his touch.
At the moment
his lips met mine...
I knew that we would
never again be apart.
I knew then
that we would spend...
the rest of our lives together.
Forever.
Oh, God, that's good.
The... End.
Oh.
Oh.
I finished, sweetheart.
You want to celebrate?
So do I.
Romeo, Romeo,
where are you, Romeo?
There.
Hey, it's Bumble Bee, kiddo.
Just so you know, I spare
no expense when I celebrate.
Here's looking at you, Jesse.
Whoever you are.
Are you finished?
Thank you.
Oh, come here, Romeo.
Yeah. Yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, my God,
Romeo, is that the time?
Gloria! I'm going to be late.
Oh!
-Hi.
-Oh, hi, pumpkin.
Mrs. Irwin, why won't
you take the elevator?
Pumpkin, I never get
in an elevator alone.
You know...rapists.
Where are you running off to?
Oh...I've got to get
to my publisher's.
By the way, pumpkin...
the mailman couldn't
fit this into your box...
so I told him
I'd give it to you.
That's some love letter.
Mrs. Irwin, you're a tease.
I know, but I keep hoping
for you, pumpkin.
Lady, how about a monkey
for your little nephew?
I'll give it to you
for ten dollars.
Really great deal.
Come on, lady.
No. I don't--
Your boyfriend will love it.
It's kind of kinky,
you know what I mean?
Nine dollars--
eight dollars, bottom line.
Thank you, but I really
don't need a monkey.
Oh, but, lady,
this is kinda cute.
Hey. That's
Miss Wilder's apartment.
Can I help you?
Excuse me.
Get away from that door.
What's this?
Uhh!
Wimp. Wimp.
Loser.
Loser.
Major loser.
Too angry. Too vague.
Too desperate.
God, too happy.
Oh. Look at this guy,
Mr. Mondo-dizmo.
I actually used to date him.
Total sleaze-bucket.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold everything.
Get a load of this character.
Now, what about him?
No, he's--he's just not--
Who? Jesse?
Maybe it's silly, but I know...
that there is somebody
out there for me.
Oh, yeah? Where?
Certainly not here.
Gloria, why do we always have
to have this same conversation?
Because I like you, and I hate
to see you all alone...
waiting for somebody
who's not gonna show up.
OK, Gloria.
Here it is.
Mmm.
Read it and weep. I always do.
I'll call you, OK?
Come on, don't leave.
Have another grasshopper.
-I can't.
-Come on, stay.
I'm your publisher.
I'm ordering you to.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I even
dragged you to this place.
I just wanted you to get out.
I know how hard
you've been working.
I know you're upset
about your sister.
Come on, how is she?
Have you heard from her?
Elaine?
I spoke to her last week.
She's still in Colombia.
Have they found
her husband's body yet?
Just the one piece.
You know what's really creepy?
I got this package
from Eduardo from Colombia.
Must have been mailed
just before he...
God!
Can you imagine how awful,
having your husband murdered?
How is she holding up?
Oh, she'll be fine.
Elaine always...manages.
Uhh!
Hey, Ira.
The kid's here with the broad.
They're taking her to the boat.
Look at these snappers,
will you?
We should have just
rifled her room.
Ralph, how many times
do I have to tell you?
It's not in the country.
This kidnapping stuff
makes me real nervous.
It's a piss-poor idea.
It's nothing but trouble.
Look, we've stolen enough
of these antique trinkets...
to keep us living comfortably
for the rest of our lives.
Let's kiss off
this Third World toilet.
One last big one.
Trust me, Ralph.
Whoa! Did you see that, Ralph?
That ugly striped son of a bitch
down there?
Somebody's gonna get killed...
and you're farting around
with prehistoric animals.
Come on, Ira!
Let's forget this one.
I got a real bad feeling
about it.
Will you stop worrying?
Have I ever hurt you?
I will never hurt you.
I can't hurt you.
We got the same blood.
We're not two people.
We are one person.
Would I hurt me?
Look at those snappers, Ralph.
Oh! Oh, Romeo!
Oh, baby! Oh!
Aah!
Hello?
Hello, Joan.
Joan, can you hear me?
Elaine,
I can't talk right now.
Listen to me.
Listen very carefully.
I'm in trouble.
Elaine, please...
Joanie, I am in real trouble.
What's the matter?
Has any mail been
forwarded to you...
with Eduardo's handwriting?
Any big envelope?
Yes.
See if there's some kind
of treasure map inside.
It says El Corazon.
I need you to bring that map
to me in Colombia.
Colombia?
My God, what kind of trouble
are you in?
Joanie, please.
Get to the Hotel Cartagena
in Cartagena.
When you arrive,
call this number: 64-58-24.
-Are you writing this down?
-Yes!
And remember,
you mustn't tell anybody.
Elaine, I can't go to Colombia.
Aah... Joanie...
they'll cut me. They'll hurt me.
Colombia?
Do you have any idea what
it's like in Colombia? I do.
Your books do very well
in these macho countries.
They have jungles there,
Joanie...
insects the size
of sanitation trucks...
revolutionaries.
-Have you had your shots?
-Shots? What shots?
You're completely
unprepared. Wait a minute.
Would you tell me
what's going on?
Why are you doing this?
Elaine is in some trouble.
She has
a little domestic problem.
Domestic problem?
Elaine's
last domestic problem...
was finding her husband
cut into small pieces.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
You cannot go!
Here's Romeo.
Now, I want you to promise me
to feed him...
and hold him
at least once a day.
You're gonna need
something stronger than that.
Listen to me.
You get bus-sick, sea-sick,
plane-sick, train-sick.
You practically puke on
the escalator at Bloomingdale's!
A lot of people
get sick in department stores.
Joanie, please, don't go.
You're not up to this, Joan,
and you know it.
I know, but she's my sister.
I'll feed him,
but I'm not picking him up.
Crazy!
The plane from New York,
has it arrived yet?
-The areo arrivo aqui?.
-No comprendo.
Is this the bus to Cartagena?
-Que?
-Oh.
Es este el autobus
a Carta--?
Cartagena.
Oh, you speak English.
Good!
Can you tell me,
is this bus going to Cartagena?
Yes, Cartagena.
Great. Thank you.
OK.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, you're on the wrong bus!
Miss Wilder!
She got on the wrong bus.
This is terrible!
Oh--
My God.
Excuse me.
Uh...
Excuse--excuse me.
I'm-- I'm very sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Ahem. I'm sorry to bother you.
Can you tell me what time
we get to Cartagena?
ls this the bus to Cartagena?
I need to get
to Cartagena-- Aah!
Shit!
What are we gonna do now?
Where's my suitcase?
You don't have to walk.
Another bus will come along.
They know nothing.
They are peasants.
Another bus? Really?
Of course.
There are schedules
to be maintained...
even in Colombia.
What?
-The purse.
-What are you--
Alto!
Aah!
Oh, my God!
What the hell?
Jesus Christ!
What the hell
happened to my birds?!
Son of a bitch!
Hi.
I demand this car in the name
of the law.
Turn this car around.
Oh, no. Talk about breaks.
Don't I know you?
You are American.
I hate Americanos.
I spit on 'em.
Ptew! I hate Americanos!
They're scumo! Scum!
Are you French?
Well, honey, looks like
we're gonna have to wait...
just a little longer.
Shit.
Excuse me.
Could you please tell me
how to get to a telephone?
Lady, I don't have
any idea. I'm sorry.
It's very important
that I get one.
We've all got
our problems today, don't we?
Can you tell me where
the nearest town is?
-How about Miami?
-Will there be another bus?
This is it.
You got rush hour.
I have to get to Cartagena.
Cartagena?
Angel, you are hell and gone
from Cartagena.
Cartagena's
over there on the coast.
-But they told me this bus.
-Who told you that?
That man that--
That nice man who pulled
a gun on you? Uh-huh.
What else did he tell you?
Please, I need your help.
I guess that's my new career.
It's very--
Lady, half a year's work
Just flew south for the winter.
My Jeep is totaled.
In five minutes, everything
I own is gonna be wet...
so could you lighten up?
I don't have the time.
I'll pay you.
You don't understand.
It's a matter of life and death.
-If I don't get--
-How much?
Fifty dollars?
Oh, shit.
You said you just lost
everything you owned.
Not my sense of humor.
I'll pay you
a hundred dollars!
Two hundred dollars!
I'll do it.
For five.
What?!
I'll pay you
two hundred and fifty dollars.
Now, I ain't cheap,
but I can be had.
My minimum price for taking
a stranded woman...
to a telephone
is four hundred dollars.
Will you take
three hundred seventy-five
in traveler's checks?
-American Express?
-Of course.
You got a deal.
Good.
You got any valuables
in that suitcase?
No. Yes!
All my clothes and things.
You got an umbrella?
No.
You got a good pair
of walking shoes?
They're all like these.
OK, let's make some time.
Aw, shit!
Oh, God damn it!
What a ride, huh?
I'm telling you...
this is turning out to be
one hell of a morning.
You OK?
I said, are you hurt?
What's the matter?
You paralysed from the neck up?
Are you hurt?
-No!
-Good!
What's your name?
I'm Joan Wilder.
Joan Wilder?
Welcome to Colombia!
Ira, l--
Hi, Ma. It's me, Irving.
Ralph, you little twerp,
where are you?
Calm down, Ma.
Who says I never call?
For Christ's sake,
tell me the story.
All right, cousin.
As usual, you got us
in some serious shit here.
First of all, the stupid dame
got on the wrong bus.
Now I'm stuck in some kind
of spico military compound.
They're mobilizing
for Iwo Jima here.
Do they know who you are?
What do you think,
I'm introducing myself...
to every cop in the pueblo?
And another little tidbit,
cousin.
Guess who else is here?
Zolo!
Oh, well, give the man a cigar!
You're goddamn right, Zolo.
He got in my car.
Not only are we kidnappers...
but I'm about to have a close
encounter with a cattle prod.
Ira:
Has he got his boys with him?
No. He's making do
with the local yo-yos.
Oh, no.
Aw! Look!
God damn it, Ralph,
get that map!
Don't yell at me, Ira!
Look, you want to kill me?
Take me back to Queens
and kill me.
Don't let me die in a jungle
like a goddamn snake.
Ralph, God damn it,
I don't care what you got to do.
Just get me that map!
Little sister
took the wrong road.
And that third party
I told you about...
he's tagging along.
The man who killed my husband?
The butcher
who killed your husband.
A very powerful man with his own
private army to back him up.
And whether he calls himself...
Dr. Zolo,
Minister of Antiquities...
or Colonel Zolo...
Deputy Commander
of the Secret Police...
he's still just a butcher.
Look at those snappers,
will you?
What's the matter? You sick?
Oh, no. I lost my button.
You lost what?
I lost my button. My button.
You're gonna lose
a lot more than that.
These were Italian.
Now they're practical.
Is nothing that I own
sacred to you?
Only your three hundred
and seventy-five dollars.
Cops!
What the hell do they want?
I haven't done anything lately.
I'm shooting at a cop!
Wait a minute. He's after you!
Who the hell are you?
Well, I'm a romance novelist.
You're what?
What are you doing here?
I told you.
My sister's life depends on me.
Don't give me that shit.
I thought you were donating
a kidney or something.
Christ, here they come.
This may be a good time
to try on those shoes.
-Wait!
-Deal's off, lady!
Wait!
Lady, you are bad news.
What'd you do,
wake up this morning and say...
''Today I'm gonna ruin
a man's life''?
Do you know where you're going?
Looks like a trail.
This is a trail?
Lady, you are a jinx!
What about the bridge?
That ain't a bridge.
Goddamn pre-Colombian art.
We can't get across that.
Aw, shit. All right.
We're gonna hold them off
right from here.
You just stay right behind me.
God damn it! I knew I should've
listened to my mother.
Faster, faster.
I could've been
a cosmetic surgeon.
Five hundred thou a year,
up to my neck in tits and ass.
Lady,
I hope you're taking notes...
'cause you got a real live
death scene going on right here.
Romantic novelist, my ass.
Holy shit!
Joan!
We can't cross.
What the hell are you doing?
Drinking?
I could've been killed,
and you're drinking!
Wait!
I will catch up to them.
Are we stopping?
Be my guest.
You OK?
Come on.
Is anybody else in there?
No.
No, it's a cargo plane.
What is all this?
All this?
Five-to-life in the States.
Couple of centuries down here.
Oh, marijuana.
Oh, you smoke it?
I went to college.
Sure.
All right! OK.
Oh, God,
do I love those fly-boys.
What?
This is Elaine's favourite drink.
You gonna tell me
about that sister of yours?
I already did.
Her husband died and...
and I've come down here
to comfort her.
-Uh-huh.
-It's the truth.
Right. Yeah, it's the truth.
All right,
I'm gonna make a fire.
You got any dry matches in here?
Well, looky here.
Huh? Oh, no, don't!
I think you and I ought
to have a talk.
All right.
Yeah, that's
what I call a campfire.
So they're ransoming your sister
for this El Corazon.
That's Spanish for ''The Heart.''
This map here
leads to The Heart.
But the heart of what?
I don't care.
You see here where it says
this El Corazon...
is hidden in Cordoba province?
So we're sitting right
in the middle of it.
All I care about is my sister,
and that map is her life.
Like hell it is.
Whatever's at the end of
this map is your sister's life.
Now, we get our hands
on this El Corazon...
then you got something
to bargain with.
I knew it would happen.
You knew what would happen?
All you care about
is yourself, isn't it?
I knew that from the first
moment I laid eyes on you.
Was that the first moment
when I saved your ass?
You see? There you go.
You have no finesse. No style.
A real man doesn't have to draw
attention to his actions.
You're just...
You're a mondo-dizmo.
I'm--What am l?
You're a man who takes money
from stranded women.
A real man is--is honest...
and forthright and trustworthy.
Would you please
do me the courtesy...
of looking at me
when I'm speaking to you?
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.
If you had
any kind of manners--
Goddamn bushmaster.
ls it poisonous?
Yeah...
but very tasty.
Uniforme.
See, you got to figure
sulfur-crested cockatoos...
they go for about
eight hundred a shot.
Then you got
gentle red-tails...
they're close
to two thousand each.
Shit, I lost close to
Do you want to know
something crazy?
What?
I don't even know your name.
Well, you never asked me.
Excuse me.
I'd really like to know--
Colton. Jack T. Colton.
What does the ''T'' stand for?
Aw, God damn it, man!
The Doobie Brothers broke up.
Shit. When did that happen?
How long have you
been down here?
Aw, man.
Forever. I don't know.
-Were you always into birds?
-Mm-mmm.
No, no. l, uh...
No, I was...
I was into shortcuts.
Birds seemed to be a fast way
to get what I wanted...
and a hell of a lot healthier
than dealing in this crap.
What is it you want?
I think I'm gonna throw
another key on the fire.
No, please.
I'm getting dizzy.
What do you want? Seriously.
I'd really like to know.
Came down here
on a coffee boat...
about a year and a half ago,
right?
Christ, what a job that was.
But I couldn't get over
that ocean, though, you know?
Yeah. I love the ocean.
You just kind of get out there
all by yourself...
nobody else around.
It's beautiful.
So that's what I want.
Try to get enough
money together...
buy a boat,
sail around the world.
So you're just gonna sail away
all by yourself?
Yeah.
Sounds lonely, Jack T. Colton.
Well...
what does the ''T'' stand for?
Trustworthy.
Aw, man, I tell you,
one hell of a morning.
It's turned into
a bitch of a day.
''Tenedor del Diablo.''
The Devil's Fork.
Zolo!
They are crossing the cemetery.
Friendly, aren't they?
Drug runners.
Just try to look mean.
Aw, shit.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing yet.
-OK, here we go.
-What?
I just knew I should have
listened to my mother.
You ready?
Ah...excuse me.
Gentlemen,
we are in need of a car.
Can any of you lovely
gentlemen tell me where...
Only one car in village.
Juan, the bell maker.
The bell maker.
Thank you.
Bell maker, my ass.
You know that fuselage
we slept in last night?
It's probably one of old Juan's
lost shipments.
You mean he's a drug--
Shh! Just don't
say a word out loud, OK?
-A dope--
-Come on, let's go.
All right.
Now, you hold back.
This one I'll handle.
What do you want, gringo?
You speak English.
That's great.
We understand
that you have a car...
and we would like
to rent it or buy it.
We have to get to a town.
What do you call this
I'm living in, a pigsty?
No. This is lovely.
Hit the road.
-You don't understand.
-Hit the road!
Senor, I'd--
It's cool.
It's cool. It's no problem.
OK, Joan Wilder,
write us out of this one.
Joan Wilder?
Joan Wilder?
The Joan Wilder?
You are Joan Wilder,
the novelist?
Yes, I am.
I read your books.
I read all your books.
Come in.
This is Juanita Wilder!
The one who writes the books
that I read to you on Saturdays.
-Come in.
-Adios, amiga.
I can't believe you're here.
Joan Wilder.
I've been reading your books
all these years.
I'm so honored to have you here.
I can't believe it.
Welcome to my humble house.
Joan Wilder. Ha! I'm sorry.
I haven't introduced myself.
I'm Juan.
I live here. Que paso? Ha ha!
The greatest novelist.
Get the door, please.
Come in. Make yourself at home.
Ever read
''The Return of Angelina''?
No.
Oh, that woman makes me hungry.
How about ''Love's Wicked Kiss?''
No. I haven't read
that one, either.
Really?
Take it. I have many copies.
I have here ''The Ravagers, ''
and I'm waiting for
''Angelina's Savage Secret.''
I'm so glad
you're here in Colombia.
I want to show you
all around my beautiful village.
We have colorful tile roofs,
typical cobblestone streets...
and very rich fields.
I was born here,
and so was my poor family.
What I would
really like would be a phone.
No phones, no phones.
I hate phones.
I don't have a phone.
But have a drink.
Let's hang out.
Look. Like it?
I can be in one of your books.
Oh, your drink.
I got Southern Comfort
or Michelob...
Kirin, Becks, Dos Equis...
Perrier, Anchor Steam,
Doctor Brown...
How about
a Xerox machine?
Yes, but she's broke.
-Where is the nearest phone?
-Many miles.
Can we get there in your car?
Who told you I had a car?
The men in the village.
They told you I had a car?
They are such comedians.
They meant my Little Mule, Pepe.
Not bad for a Little Mule, eh?
Now Pepe's warming up.
What are we stopping for?
I can't hurt my favorite pig.
Look out! Watch it!
See over there by the fence?
That's where my mother was born.
And see that tree,
the third tree up the ridge?
My brother planted that tree.
OK, Pepe, let's lose them.
-This guy's crazier than I am.
-Gracias. Yeah!
What the hell you doing?
That field was cover!
I wanted to show you
this other field.
This guy who's following you,
he's very persistent.
No problem.
My Little Mule is fireproof.
-See that river?
-The one without the bridge?
This is the main water supply
for many villages.
What do you mean,
the one without the bridge?
The one without the bridge!
Where the hell are you going?
To Lupe's Escape. I used it
many times in the past.
You're OK now.
You need Little Mule
to use Lupe's Escape.
You know, that river,
it's impossible to cross...
for two hundred miles
in either direction.
In fact, over that mountain...
the river becomes wild,
muy peligroso--
waterfalls, rapids.
Angelina country. Right, Joan?
What ever happened to Lupe?
Terrible disappointment
to family.
I can imagine.
He entered the priesthood,
so I took over the business.
Is for the best.
I'm not so reckless.
He might have ended up hanging
from El Tenedor del Diablo.
It used to happen to bandidos.
El Tenedor del Diablo?
OK, let's hit it.
We're on a roll.
I'm sorry I cannot take
you all the way to Cartagena.
Beyond this town,
I am a wanted man.
But in the morning,
there's always a bus.
It will take you.
Of all the things
you can say to me right now...
''I've lost her, Ralph...''
is gonna get the most teeth
broken in your mouth.
Bullet head, if they're hiking
through the jungle...
there's nothing
I can do about it.
I have a car. I am not Tarzan.
I have been through
every one-horse shithole...
for a two-hundred-mile radius.
You should've seen the river
I had to traverse this morning.
So don't give me any of
your crap, you gutless wonder.
You have been an embarrassment
to me and the whole family...
ever since you were born.
And one more thing--
Joan.
Yeah?
You are the luckiest
son of a bitch...
that ever walked the earth!
She's here!
She's there?
She's right here.
She's coming right toward
the phone booth.
She's with some guy.
How do I know? She likes guys.
So do you, maricon.
All the rooms have baths.
That's great.
You speak English, too.
That's great.
Listen, you wouldn't have
a Xerox machine around here?
Yeah. We have one in the back.
It's big enough
to take, like, map-size?
Yeah, complete.
Yes, I understand.
I'll do that.
Well, I talked to Elaine.
She's all right.
They're gonna wait for me
to take the bus in the morning.
That's great. You're covered.
I don't know.
He sounded so smug.
-Who?
-That bastard that's got Elaine.
Sure he is. You're bringing
him what he wants--the map.
Yeah.
Well...
I guess this is it.
I guess so.
Three-seventy-five.
That was the contract, right?
Yep. That was it.
The least I can do
is buy you some dinner.
Looks like it's gonna
be a hell of a party.
I'd like that.
I'll tell you what.
I got a room in the hotel.
Why don't you go get cleaned up?
I'll buy us some new rags.
Number seven.
-Seven?
-Yeah.
That's my lucky number.
Mine, too.
It's just beautiful.
Thank you, Jack.
I think
your writing's hot. It's great.
I mean it. I'm telling you,
I'm impressed. I am.
You've never even read the book.
I know. I know.
I suppose it's my way
of living in another age.
If you did that,
I never would have met you.
I got you something.
El Corazon?
Let's dance.
-Oh, no, I can't.
-I'll show you.
-I-- No.
-Come on. Trust me.
I lost my langostino.
No, lady! No! Lady!
Calm down, lady!
Someday, if I had the money...
I'd take you.
I'd sail away.
Just the two of us.
Around the world and back again.
I promise you.
I promise you we'd do that.
Why haven't you
taken the map away from me?
What are you talking about?
I saw that tree today,
The Devil's Fork.
It's on the map.
You know how close we are?
Sure I do, but what has that
got to do with it?
I was thinking
about something you said--
about having more
to bargain with.
The best way to help your sister
is to get that treasure...
and then you can waltz
into Cartagena.
You're holding all the cards.
I'd love to see you
on that boat.
But, Jack, if we have
to give it up to save Elaine...
Then we give it up.
It's your sister.
Of course we give it up,
but that's the point.
At least we got the leverage
to do it.
Let's go for it.
Inspect, soldiers. That woman
has to be here.
He just won't quit.
-What are you doing?
-Hot-wiring the car.
Try the key.
There it is. That's the shrine.
-Let's go.
-Yeah.
They are on the virgin road.
Well, this can't be all.
There's gotta be
another clue here.
Landmarks change,
things grow...
all that stuff, you know?
Hey, you hear that?
-Waterfall.
-Look, Jack.
All right, Joan!
You all right?
Oh! This has got to be it.
Hey. What does
''Leche de la Madre'' mean?
''Leche de la Madre''?
Yeah. It's on the map.
It means Mother's Milk.
-Mother's Milk?
-Yeah.
I'll be goddamned.
Mama, I'm home.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
What?
Digging for treasure with you.
Jack?
Yeah?
You're the best time
I've ever had.
Never been
anybody's best time before.
It's a priceless statue.
Somebody out there's got
a really sick sense of humor.
Wait a minute.
My first book,
''Treasures of Lust''...
I hid the treasure
inside the statue.
Jesus Christ,
we're in a lot of trouble.
Understatement
of the year, asshole.
Is there anybody
who isn't following you?
Put the goods in the bag.
Come on.
Come on.
Now move it,
before Batman comes home.
It's time
I had a chauffeur, Miss Wilder.
Hey, back off me, creep!
Oh, I'm the creep, huh?
Well, at least I'm honest.
I'm stealing this stone.
I'm not trying to romance it
out from under her.
Wait a minute. Going for
the stone was my idea.
That's what the good
con artists want you to think.
He made you think
you needed it, you sap!
Get in and drive!
Come on! Move it!
Move it!
See how you like being stuck--
Holy shit!
Get in!
Which way do we go?
Follow that stone!
Mounties!
Hit it!
Where the hell you going?
Where am I going?
How about Lupe's Escape?
Where you going? Quit steering.
You're not going anywhere.
Oh, no!
What are we gonna do now?
Jump!
Hey!
Joan Wilder!
Hey! What a comeback!
Ha ha ha ha! Whoo!
Yeah.
-Man, I thought you drowned!
-I did!
You OK?
Oh, sure. I'm great.
I'm fine!
Only you're on that side!
There's no way
across this sucker!
You did this on purpose!
What are you talking about?
We just went over a waterfall!
Admit it!
You planned this all along!
I knew
I couldn't depend on you!
What's the name
of that hotel in Cartagena?
Hotel Cartagena!
What do you care?
All right. You just head
towards the sunset...
and you'll make it!
And I'll be there!
Oh, yeah, sure.
With El Corazon in your pocket.
What about my sister?
They don't have to know
about this. You got the map!
-Well, you've got the stone!
-Yeah, but--
I'll meet you there!
Trust me!
-What?
-I'll be there!
So you made it finally.
Got the map?
Yes, I brought it.
I want to talk to Elaine.
No. You can't talk to her
till I get it.
All right,
now look out your window.
See the fort across the bay?
The tower?
Yes.
You take a water taxi
right outside your hotel.
You meet me there in two hours--
all by yourself.
Hello?
Has Jack Colton checked in?
In the last two minutes, no.
Over here.
Stop right there.
Let me see the map.
Where are you?
Let me see the map.
Let me see Elaine.
Joanie?
Drop the map and back off.
If this isn't genuine...
If you've pulled a fast one...
Joan Wilder, you...
and your sister...
can go!
Hey.
It's OK. It's all right.
Let's go home tonight.
I missed you at the hotel.
We all did.
You brainless broad,
you let him follow you here.
Come on.
This map is nothing.
They already have the stone.
I had it in my hands, Ira.
These hands that are gonna break
every bone in your body.
Later.
Where is it?
I don't know.
Where is the stone?
I don't...
We dug.
We didn't find anything.
Traigala!
Crocodiles shed tears
while they eat their prey.
You have heard of these tears,
I am sure.
But have you seen them?
-Aah!
-Stop it!
Oh, no! No!
Look at those snappers.
You can forego this agony.
Simply tell me,
where is El Corazon?
Where is the heart?
Where is the stone?
All right!
Just let her go, will you?
She doesn't know where it is.
I've got it.
Where is it?
It's in a safe place.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Choke on it.
Thank you.
Get down!
All right, honey.
Come on.
Hurry. Hurry.
Boys! Muchachos!
Bring the boat around!
Hold them down!
Let me get to the boat!
Just a little more.
Come on.
Ira!
Ira!
Come back here, Ira!
Jump, Ralph, jump!
I can't swim.
You know that, Ira.
-I'll come back for you!
-You promise?
I'll send the boat
back for you, Ralph!
-When?
-Soon!
-How soon?
-Very soon!
No.
No! No!
Where do you think
you're going, huh, pal?
Come on, cough it up.
Wait, wait!
Joanie?
How will you die, Joan Wilder?
Slow like a snail...
or fast like a shooting star?
Oh, my.
Come on, you bastard.
Give me a break.
No!
Jack!
Damn it!
Oh, Jack.
It's OK. It's OK.
Come on back, Ira!
You're my cousin, Ira!
Don't you remember?
Your mother, my mother!
That way!
That way! He's getting away!
He's got it all! Go that way!
Joanie?
OK. All right.
Here's what we got to do.
Get to the American Consulate.
Just tell them everything.
Where are you going?
They might believe you,
but don't mention my name.
Cartagena cops and l
go way back.
Elaine, it's been a pleasure.
You're leaving?
You're leaving me?
You're gonna be all right,
Joan Wilder.
Yeah.
You always were.
Jack Colton!
Damn.
Oh.
Well, that is far and away
your best book.
I can't believe how fast
you cranked this out.
You really like it?
Like it? Look at me.
I'm a mess. It made me cry.
You tell anybody,
I'll cut your heart out.
I love the end where he dives
off the wall and swims away.
Then he meets her
at the airport.
They sail off
around the world together.
God, I can't believe
how this got to me.
Well...
I was, uh, inspired.
Joanie, you are now
a world-class hopeless romantic.
No. Hopeful.
Hopeful romantic.
No, thank you.
Nope.
MAN: Name-brand. Name-brand.
Never wear 'em.
MAN: You can wear it
right now. Five dollars.
Hey!
I like your boots.
Yep. That poor old
yellow-tailed guy...
developed a fatal case
of indigestion.
Died right in my arms.
I can't blame him.
If I were to die...
there's nowhere else on earth
I'd rather be.
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.
I even read one of your books.
Then you know how they all end.
Yeah.
-Hi.
-Hi.
