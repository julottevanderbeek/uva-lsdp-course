-
- Easy, boy.
Man:
One lot steals a goat
from another lot,
before you know it they're ripping
each other to pieces.
I've never seen wildlings
do a thing like this.
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.
-
- How close did you get?
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the wall.
Do the dead frighten you?
Our orders were
to track the wildlings.
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.
You don't think
he'll ask us how they died?
Get back on your horse.
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.
They even killed
the children.
It's a good thing
we're not children.
You want to run away south,
run away.
Of course they will
behead you as a deserter,
if I don't
catch you first.
Get back on your horse.
I won't say it again.
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.
They were here.
See where they went.
What is it?
It's...

Go on, father's watching.
Fine work as always.
Well done.
Thank you.
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.
The stitching...
-
-
And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?
Keep practicing, Bran.
Go on.
Don't think
too much, Bran.
Relax your bow arm.
Quick, Bran!
Faster.
Lord Stark!
My lady.
A guardsman just
rode in from the hills.
They've captured a deserter
from The Night's Watch.
Get the lads to saddle
their horses.
Do you have to?
He swore an oath, Cat.
The law is law,
my lady.
Tell Bran he's coming too.
Ned.
to see such things.
He won't be a boy forever.
And winter is coming.
Lad, go run back
and get the rest.
White Walkers.
I saw the White Walkers.
White Walkers.
The White Walkers,
I saw them.
I know I broke my oath.
And I know
I'm a deserter.
I should have gone back to the wall
and warned them, but--
I saw what I saw.
I saw the White Walkers.
If you can get word
to my family...
Forgive me, Lord.
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.
Father will know if you do.
I, Eddard of the House Stark,
Lord of Winterfell
and warden of the north,
sentence you to die.
You did well.
You understand
why I did it?
Jon said
he was a deserter.
But do you understand
why  had to kill him?
"Our way is the old way"?
The man who passes
the sentence
should swing the sword.
Is it true he saw
the White Walkers?
The White Walkers have been
gone for thousands of years.
So he was lying?
A madman sees what he sees.
What is it?
Mountain lion?
There are no Mountain lions
in these woods.
It's a freak!
It's a direwolf.
Tough old beast.
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.
Now there are five.
You want to hold it?
Bran:
Where will they go?
Their mother's dead.
They don't belong
down here.
Better
a quick death.
They won't last
without their mother.
- Right. Give it here.
- No!
-
- Put away your blade.
I take orders
from your father, not you.
- Please, father!
- I'm sorry, Bran.
Lord Stark?
There are
five pups...
one for each
of the Stark children.
-
- The direwolf is the sigil of your House.
They were meant
to have them.
You will train them
yourselves.
You will
feed them yourselves.
And if they die,
you will bury them yourselves.
What about you?
I'm not a Stark.
Get on.
What is it?
The runt of the litter--
that one's yours, snow.
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you:
You worry too much.
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.
and you were never afraid.
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told father.
"We're lannisters.
Lannisters
don't act like fools."
But who would he tell?
- My husband.
- If he told the King, both our heads
would be skewered
on the city gates by now.
Whatever Jon Arryn
knew or didn't know, it died with him.
And Robert will choose a new
Hand of the King-- someone to do his job
while he's off fucking boars
and hunting whores--
or is it
the other way around?
And life will go on.
You should be
The Hand of the King.
That's an honor
I can do without.
Their days are too long,
their lives are too short.
All these years
and I still feel
like an outsider
when I come here.
You have five
northern children.
You're not an outsider.
I wonder
if the old gods agree.
It's your gods
with all the rules.
I am so sorry, my love.
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.
Jon Arryn is dead.
-
- They both have their health,
The raven
brought more news...
The King rides
for Winterfell...
with the Queen
If he's coming
this far north...
There's only
one thing he's after.
You can always say no, Ned.
Catelyn:
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.
I'm told he reads
all night.
I'm told he drinks
all night.
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...
Stature?
We've brought up
eight barrels of ale from the cellar.
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case,
Why is your mother so dead set
on us getting pretty for the King?
It's for the Queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.
Think of all those
southern girls he gets to stab
with his right
royal prick.
Go on, Tommy,
shear him good.
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.
-
- Gods, but they grow fast.
Brandon!
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.
How many times
have I told you no climbing?
But he's coming right now--
down our road.
I want you
to promise me,
no more climbing.
I promise.
- Do you know what?
- What?
You always look
at your feet before you lie.
Run and find your father.
Tell him the King is close.
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?
- Hey hey hey hey.
- Ohh.
What are you doing
with that on?
- Go on.
-
Move!
Your Grace.
You've got fat.
- Cat!
- Your Grace.
Nine years-- why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?
Guarding the north
for you, your Grace.
- Where's the imp?
- Will you shut up?
Robert:
Who have we here?
You must be Robb.
My, you're
a pretty one.
Your name is?
Arya.
Oh, show us
your muscles.
You'll be a soldier.
Arya:
Sansa:
My Queen.
My Queen.
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.
We've been riding
for a month, my love.
Surely the dead can wait.
Ned.
Where's the imp?
Where is our brother?
Go and find
the little beast.
Tell me about
Jon Arryn.
One minute
he was fine and then...
Burned right through him,
whatever it was.
I loved that man.
We both did.
Robert:
He never had to teach
you much, but me?
You remember me at 16?
-
- All I wanted to do
was crack skulls
and fuck girls.
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.
I need you, Ned--
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.
Lord Eddard Stark,
I would name you
the Hand of the King.
I'm not worthy
of the honor.
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom
while I eat, drink and whore
my way to an early grave.
Damn it, Ned, stand up.
You helped me win
the iron throne,
now help me
keep the damn thing.
We were meant
to rule together.
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.
Well, it's not too late.
I have a son,
you have a daughter.
We'll join our Houses.
-
- It is true what they say
about the northern girls.
Did you hear the King's
in Winterfell?
I did hear
something about that.
And the Queen
and her twin brother.
They say that  is the most
handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
And the other brother?
- The Queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one,
and there's
the clever one.
Mmm, I hear they
call him the imp.
I hear he hates
that nickname.
Oh?
I hear he's
more than earned it.
I hear he's a drunken
little lecher,
prone to all manner
of perversions.
Clever girl.
We've been expecting you,
Lord Tyrion.
Have you?
- Oh!
- Already?
The gods gave me
one blessing.
- Don't get up.
- My Lord.
Should I explain to you
the meaning of a closed door
- in a whorehouse, brother?
- You have much to teach me, no doubt,
but our sister craves
your attention.
She has odd cravings,
our sister.
A family trait.
Now the Starks are
feasting us at sundown.
Don't leave me alone
with these people.
And this is the first
of many courses.
I thought
you might say that.
But since
we're short on time...
Come on, girls.
See you at sundown.
Tyrion:
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?
with the sun
and the clouds above her.
This is where
she belongs.
She belonged with me.
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.
It's done, your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.
Not all of them.
Man:
Daenerys.
There's our bride-to-be.
Look, a gift
from Illyrio.
Touch it.
Go on,
feel the fabric.
Mmm.
Isn't he a gracious host?
We've been his guests
for over a year
and he's never
asked us for anything.
Illyrio's no fool.
He knows I won't
forget my friends
when I come
into my throne.
You still slouch.
Let them see.
You have
a woman's body now.
I need you to be
perfect today.
Can you do that for me?
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?
No.
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,
they will say
it began today.
It's too hot, my lady.
Where is he?
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.
May I present
my honored guests?
Do you see
how long his hair is?
Khal Drogo has
never been defeated.
He's a savage, of course,
And you will be his Queen.
Come forward, my dear.
Where is he going?!
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.
- Did he like her?
- Trust me, your Grace,
if he didn't like her,
we'd know.
It won't be
long now.
Soon you will cross
the Narrow Sea
and take back
your father's throne.
The people
drink secret toasts
to your health.
They cry out
for their true king.
When will they
be married?
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.
Is it true they lie
with their horses?
I wouldn't ask
Khal Drogo.
Do you take me
for a fool?
I take you
for a King.
Kings lack the caution
of common men.
My apologies if
I've given offense.
I know how to play
a man like Drogo.
I give him a Queen
and he gives me an army.
I don't want
to be his Queen.
I want to go home.
So do I.
I want us both
to go home,
but they took it from us.
So tell me, sweet sister,
how do we go home?
I don't know.
We go home with an army.
With Khal Drogo's army.
I would let
his whole tribe fuck you--
all 40,000 men
and their horses too
if that's what it took.
Do you think Joffrey
will like me?
What if he thinks
I'm ugly?
Then he is the stupidest prince
that ever lived.
He's so handsome.
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.
Why would he say no?
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.
He'd have to leave home.
He'd have to leave me.
And so would you.
You left your home
to come here.
And I'd be Queen someday.
Please make father
say yes!
- Sansa--
- Please please!
It's the only thing
I ever wanted.
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.
Is he dead yet?
Uncle Benjen.
You got bigger.
Rode all day.
Didn't want to leave you
alone with the Lannisters.
Why aren't you
at the feast?
Lady Stark thought
it might insult the royal family
to seat a bastard
in their midst.
Well, you're always
welcome on the wall.
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.
So take me with you
when you go back.
- Jon--
- Father will let me if you ask him.
I know he will.
The wall isn't
going anywhere.
I'm ready
to swear your oath.
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.
We have no families.
- None of us will ever father sons--
- I don't care about that!
You might, if you knew
what it meant.
I'd better get inside,
rescue your father
from his guests.
We'll talk later.
Tyrion:
What are you doing
back there?
Preparing for a night
with your family.
I've always wanted
to see the wall.
You're Tyrion Lannister,
the Queen's brother?
My greatest
accomplishment.
And you-- you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?
Did I offend you?
Sorry.
You are
the bastard though.
And Lady Stark
is not your mother,
making you the bastard.
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.
Never forget
what you are.
The rest of the world
will not.
Wear it like armor
and it can never
be used to hurt you.
What the hell do you know about
being a bastard?
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.
You at a feast--
it's like a bear in a trap.
The boy I beheaded--
- did you know him?
- Of course I did.
Just a lad.
And he was tough, Ned,
a true ranger.
Pfft.
He was talking madness.
Said the Walkers
slaughtered his friends.
The two he was with
are still missing.
Hmph.
A wildling ambush.
Maybe.
Direwolves
south of the wall,
talk of The Walkers,
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.
Winter  coming.
Winter is coming.
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
Is this your first time
in the north, your Grace?
Yes.
Lovely country.
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me
up here
for the first time.
Hello, little dove.
But you are a beauty.
- How old are you?
- 13, your Grace.
You're tall.
Still growing?
I think so, your Grace.
And have you bled yet?
No, your Grace.
Your dress,
did you make it?
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.
I hear the same.
Your daughter will
do well in the capital.
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden
up here forever.
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.
- I hope it's true.
- Yes,
the King has honored me
with his offer.
I'm sure we'll have
a tournament
to celebrate your new title--
if you accept.
It would be good
to have you on the field.
The competition
has become a bit stale.
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?
Getting
a little old for it?
I don't fight
in tournaments
because when I fight
a man for real
I don't want him to know
what I can do.
Well said.
-
- Arya!
It's not funny!
She always does it
and it's not funny!
Robb:
Time for bed.
Ned:
I'm a Northman.
I belong here with you,
not down south
in that rats' nest
they call a capital.
I  let him
take you.
The king
takes what he wants.
That's why he's King.
I'll say,
"listen, fat man."
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.
He belongs to me now."
How did he get so fat?
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink.
Man:
Send him in.
Pardon, my Lord,
my Lady.
A rider in the night...
from your sister.
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.
What's she doing
at the Eyrie?
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.
What news?
She says Jon Arryn
was murdered.
By the Lannisters.
She says the King
is in danger.
She's fresh widowed, Cat.
She doesn't know
what she's saying.
Lysa's head would be
on a spike right now
if the wrong people
had found that letter.
Do you think she would
risk her life--
her son's life--
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?
If this news is true
and the Lannisters
conspire against the throne,
who but you can
protect the King?
They murdered
the last Hand.
Now you want Ned
to take the job?
The King rode
for a month
to ask for
Lord Stark's help.
He's the only one
he trusts.
You swore the King
an oath, my Lord.
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.
He owes him nothing.
Your father and brother
rode south once
on a King's demand.
A different time.
A different King.
When do I meet
with the Khal?
We need to begin
planning the invasion.
If Khal Drogo has
promised you a crown,
- you shall have it.
- When?
When their omens
favor war.
I piss on Dothraki omens.
I've waited 17 years
to get my throne back.
-
-
A Dothraki wedding
without at least three deaths
is considered a dull affair.
A small gift,
for the new Khaleesi--
songs and histories
from the Seven Kingdoms.
Thank you, Ser.
Are you from my country?
Ser Jorah Mormont
of Bear Island.
I served your father
for many years.
Gods be good, I hope to always
serve the rightful King.
Illyrio:
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,
from the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai.
The ages have
turned them to stone,
but they will
always be beautiful.
Thank you, Magister.
She's beautiful.
Ser Jorah,
I don't know how to say
thank you
in Dothraki.
There is no word
for thank you in Dothraki.
Make him happy.
- No.
-
Do you know
the common tongue?
-
- No.
Is "no" the only word
that you know?
Rough night, imp?
If I get through this
without squirting
from one end or the other
it'll be a miracle.
I didn't pick you
for a hunter.
The greatest in the land--
my spear never misses.
It's not hunting
if you pay for it.
Are you as good
with a spear as you used to be?
No, but I'm still
better than you.
I know what I'm
putting you through.
Thank you for saying yes.
I only ask you
because I need you.
You're a loyal friend.
You hear me?
A
The last one I've got.
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.
And I'll make sure you
don't look so fucking grim all the time.
Come on, you.
Stop!
- Stop.
-
Are you completely mad?
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.
- It's all right.
- He saw us!
I heard you
the first time.
Quite the little climber,
aren't you?
- How old are you, boy?
- 10.
The things
I do for love.
