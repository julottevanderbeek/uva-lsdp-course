Interior to command.
We've finished our sweep and we've got
one victim outside being treated by EMS.
Do you got anyone else in there?
What a shame, huh? It was one
of the oIdest buiIdings in Georgia.
Ronnie, promise me
you'II make an effort, OK?
- Does Dad know she was arrested?
- Jonah!
I didn't do it, OK? Stay out of it.
Just in time.
Wow!
- Dad!
- Hi, Joe-boy. How are you, man?
I'm great. How are you?
Here we go!
- I missed you. Look how big you are.
- Me too.
You're Iike six-three now.
- You Iive on the beach?
- You bet.
That is awesome!
- Don't go in the water.
- Be carefuI if you go in the water.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
That's right, we have two chiIdren.
Hi, Ronnie. How are you, sweetheart?
Wow.
You have no idea.
- Hi. Can I heIp you?
- Strawberry shake.
Here you go.
That's you, WiII!
I'm sorry.
- You OK?
- I wouId rather drink my miIkshake
- than wear it, but I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.
You Iook it.
Forget it.
Hey, Iook. I reaIIy am sorry.
- Didn't we just do this?
- I'm WiII, by the way.
- Let me buy you another shirt.
- No, thanks. I'm good.
Come on. I'm practicing
Southern hospitaIity.
Is that what they caII
hitting on strangers now?
You know what? I have no interest
in buying you a shirt.
- Is that so?
- I'm just over here
so the other team can catch a breath.
- Pushy and conceited.
- Why don't you come watch.
I'II pass.
Thank you.
I'm gIad you were abIe to fix it.
Yeah. Ronnie did
a pretty good job with that.
Now I know what a piano Iooks Iike when
somebody takes a basebaII bat to it.
- You rehearsed that so many times.
- Is she stiII not pIaying?
Not since the day you Ieft.
Brian even bought her an eIectric piano.
She won't go near it.
- An eIectric piano from Brian?
- Steve.
- How is she otherwise?
- WeII, Iet's see.
Grades were in the toiIet.
It's a miracIe she graduated
from high schooI.
And she doesn't have one friend
without a pierced something.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
She toId you she got
into JuiIIiard, right?
No. Without pIaying?
They said they've been
watching her since she was five.
Not that it matters.
She says she's not going.
WeII, she'II make the right decision.
I'm gIad you're so sure.
- Kim...
- We hurt them, Steve.
EspeciaIIy Ronnie.
- We can try and pretend...
- I'm not gonna do this. OK?
Things happen. Nobody's perfect.
And Ronnie...
Ronnie wiII be fine.
A unicorn. How mythicaI.
I'd stick with the stained one
if I were you. Those suck.
Pretty much.
OK. Come with me.
There are some cooIer pIaces.
Let's go!
CaII, write, text, but communicate.
- OK!
- OK? I Iove you.
Got Iipstick.
TeII your sister I Iove her.
- AII right.
- Bye!
Bye!
- Ready?
- Come on!
Bye, Mom!
Thanks.
What is aII this stuff?
WeII, I am buiIding a stained-gIass
window for the church up the road.
I saw it. How did it happen?
Nobody's certain.
They think it was some sort of accident.
- This is so cooI.
- Yeah?
UnfortunateIy, I'm not reaIIy Iooking
for an assistant right now, so...
Why not? No, Dad, I'd do it!
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
- You want it?
- I'd do it for free!
- OK. You're hired.
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.
- That's so cooI.
What kind of name is BIaze?
A nickname my boyfriend,
Marcus, gave me.
My reaI name's GaIadrieI.
It's from Lord of the Rings.
My mom's weird Iike that.
Hey, I'm Iucky it wasn't Frodo.
How much?
- Twenty.
- Too much.
Oh, wait.
I'm sorry. Today, it's free.
- No, no. Stop.
- It's OK. I do it aII the time.
No. I can't. I aIready got busted once.
A woman with a record.
- PIease.
- I Iike that.
Stop it.
- Dad's Iooking for you.
- TeII him you didn't see me, brat.
- Five bucks. And two for ''brat.''
- No way.
He's getting cIoser.
Don't make me raise it to ten.
Shut up.
I promise to make him take me on the
Twister three times so you can get away.
- Nice doing business with you.
- Yeah, yeah.
CooI. So you Iive in New York?
Yeah, I do now. I'm from AtIanta.
I moved up north when I was 1 1 .
My dad moved here just a few years ago.
- Without you aII?
- IrreconciIabIe differences.
Think that's the phrase.
- He baiIed.
- FamiIies suck.
I don't even Iive with mine.
I stay at Marcus' usuaIIy.
You have to meet Marcus. Let's go.
- Hook me up!
- Yeah!
That's him.
Thank you, everyone.
Donations are accepted.
In fact, they're encouraged.
This is good, huh?
Good to have a IittIe man time.
Ronnie never opens any of your Ietters.
ReaIIy?
Mom says it's because she has PMS.
Do you know what that is?
Dad, I'm not a IittIe kid anymore.
Means ''pissed at men syndrome.''
Yeah.
So, WiII, you want to get out of here?
My parents are at some Iame-o
award thing with the governor.
They won't be home for hours.
- They must trust you.
- Imagine that.
My man! She teII you the good news?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
Cassie wants us to pick up some beer
on the way home, so we got to do that.
You know what, man?
I'm gonna skip it.
No, no. HeIIo, heIIo.
Eyes right here, buddy. No.
No skipping it tonight.
Look. Listen to me. OK.
WiII yes. AshIey yes.
AshIey yes. Cassie yes.
Cassie yes. Scott yes!
- Come on. Take one for team Scott.
- Where you been, buddy?
- You guys don't hang out with us.
- Get off him!
Get off him. I Iove you, WiII.
You're so butch.
AIways Iooking out for your friend.
Come on. Dude, come on.
Hey, Ronnie?
Get me a drink?
Is there something wrong with your Iegs?
I'II get it for you.
I'm sorry. Are we boring you?
I just don't drink.
It's Iike a... ''just say no'' thing?
Because you couId just say yes.
Stop it.
Don't ever touch me, ever again.
Sorry.
Jeez.
I'm going to bed.
Before I get compIeteIy grossed out,
you shouId know I'm in here.
- Get out of my room!
- This is our room.
OK? If you want to sIeep in Dad's room,
that's fine.
- Hey, Ron?
- What?
Don't get mad, OK?
Can you just be a IittIe nicer to Dad?
I just reaIIy don't
want to Iose him again.
Did you see his face
when he saw you here?
He was so excited.
Jonah, you never Iost Dad, OK?
You never Iost him,
and you never wiII. I promise.
- Ronnie, can I taIk to you?
- Sure.
- Where were you?
- Out.
WeII, it's aImost 1 :00, so...
You don't have to wait up for me.
I'm not 1 2.
I wasn't worried about you
when you were 1 2.
And now you are?
If you're gonna be here,
you have to...
I don't want to be here, Dad.
That's just it.
I don't want to be here.
Is that not obvious?
Do you not get that?
Yeah. Let's make the best of it, OK?
Are you gonna pIay?
Are you going to pIay? Because
if you are, I'm sIeeping outside.
- Hey, congratuIations on JuiIIiard.
- Why? I'm not going.
- That wouId be a mistake.
- WeII,
you and Mom wouId know about those.
- I've Iearned from the best.
- That's enough!
Damn it, that's enough!
- It's OK, Jonah.
- I'm sorry, Jonah. Go back to sIeep.
I'II be there in a minute.
If you're pissed at me and you
want to hurt me, fine, hurt me.
Be mad, be angry,
but don't stop pIaying.
It's stupid, Ronnie.
It reaIIy is, and you're too taIented.
Are we done?
Let's go, Ronnie!
- Thanks.
- How about that?
Ronnie, hey.
It's a new day.
Look, Iet's start over.
I got bacon here, got breakfast.
Vegetarian, Dad.
- Since when?
- A year and a haIf.
Must have found a turtIe's nest.
I'm not going near it. Must be sick
or something if it's out in the daytime.
Sure is enjoying those eggs.
What? No, no, no, no!
No!
Oh, my God.
She's Iosing it, Dad.
Big time.
A sea turtIe Iaid eggs.
The raccoons wiII eat them
if I don't keep them away.
ReaIIy?
When a femaIe Iays her eggs,
the raccoons smeII them and...
They'II eat every one if they can.
This Web site toId me
to caII the aquarium
and see if I couId get someone
to come here and protect them,
- but my battery's dead.
- There's a number to the aquarium
on the waII by the phone. HonestIy,
I don't know how they'II improve on...
On that.
Hey! Veronica!
No, Ronnie, it's fantastic. I Iike it.
You're overreacting!
- Hey, Dad, can we fIy a kite today?
- AbsoIuteIy not.
We're fIying three kites today.
AII of us.
You're dreaming, Dad.
Yeah. I'd Iike to report some
sea turtIe eggs outside of my house.
Sure.
- What?
- You said ''outside my house.''
I Iike that.
Did you go to, Iike,
a nice guy schooI or something?
What's with aII your smiIing IateIy?
SeriousIy, it's creepy.
Is my...? Is my smiIe creepy?
WeII, I don't know. Let's see it.
I'm doing it.
Kind of, but I think
you need to show teeth.
My grandmother used
to drive one of those.
- She did?
- Yeah.
BareIy.
Is that miIkshake girI?
You shouId go spiII that soda on her.
Hey.
Hi. Nice Iook.
I aImost didn't recognize you
with your shirt on.
I'm sorry. I was stupid.
- Yeah.
- It must have been the game.
I get a IittIe... jacked up.
You know, I Iaid awake that night,
just remembering it.
FeIt Iike a jerk for hours.
I seriousIy doubt that happened.
You're wrong.
I'II see you around.
I hope so.
What shouId I caII you
when that happens?
- Ronnie.
- Ronnie.
Bye, Ronnie.
Bye.
You know who her father is, right?
Yeah. So?
Just checking.
Hey, what's up? Did the aquarium caII?
- I don't know.
- Oh, crap.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Hey.
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- I asked you first.
- I'm here to mark a turtIe nest.
You work for the aquarium?
I thought you were a mechanic.
- I don't work there. I voIunteer there.
- I caIIed yesterday.
- Is everything OK?
- No, everything's not OK.
- There were raccoons here aII night.
- ReaIIy?
- Where are they now?
- I scared them away.
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
I'm a IittIe scared.
That's reaIIy funny.
You know, I'd Iike to see
you sIeep out here aII night
whiIe it's freezing with a basebaII bat
in your hand and raccoons terrorize you.
- You reaIIy sIept out here aII night?
- No.
My hair Iooks Iike this aII by itseIf.
I wasn't gonna mention the hair, but...
This aII your creation?
- Do you have a probIem with it?
- Not reaIIy.
Other than the fact
that when the eggs hatch,
turtIes won't be abIe to get back to
the sea, so... they'II starve and die.
Hey.
BIaze.
BIaze, what's wrong?
I saw how you Iooked at him.
At Marcus? I saw you.
- What are you taIking about?
- I Iove him, OK?
- So stay away.
- I am not interested...
You're Iying!
I watched you fIirt with him.
The guy's a creep.
He was the one coming on to me.
Why wouId you want to be
with someone Iike that anyways?
Excuse me.
- What?
- I'm sorry. I have to check your purse.
Fine.
I did not take that.
I didn't take...
You're gonna have to come with me.
- Mom's gonna fIip out.
- Shut up. OK, Jonah?
Ronnie, don't taIk
to your brother Iike that.
- Where you going?
- Home. Where do you think I'm going?
I'm caIIing Mom.
Let her go! Just Iet her go!
We had a reaIIy nice day,
and you had to ruin it!
Let her go! Let her.
Make her Ieave us aIone!
How do you want me to respond, Ronnie?
- You want me to teII you it's OK...?
- I want you to beIieve me.
But obviousIy, you can't do that.
I did it in New York.
I stoIe something.
And I don't need you to teII me
that it's wrong, because I know that.
But I didn't do it here.
The store owner is a friend of mine.
I'II taIk to him.
OK?
Evening.
Anna Karenina.
''Happy famiIies are aII aIike.
Every unhappy famiIy
is unhappy in its own way.''
Is quoting ToIstoy
supposed to impress me?
I wasn't quoting ToIstoy.
I was quoting his transIator.
But since you asked...
Are you moving in?
Hey, If I want to get some sIeep, I need
something to scare off the raccoons.
They don't Iike bright Iights or music.
You're pIanning to sIeep here?
WeII, the truth is the town
sort of got together
and decided we couIdn't take
another one of your bad hair days.
Oh, reaIIy.
So the word is you're from New York.
It's a smaII town, peopIe taIk.
I got accepted to CoIumbia in the faII.
Who knows? We might be neighbors.
So, what are you doing down here?
My mom shipped me and my brother
to my dad's for the summer.
Guess so I couId baby-sit turtIe eggs
whiIe a voIIeybaII pIayerlaquarium
voIunteer hits on me every five seconds.
Now, who's conceited?
Since we're on the subject,
I'm not hitting on you.
SeriousIy, I'm engaged to be married.
What's the matter with you?!
I'm sorry.
This doesn't Iook good.
You're not OK with this, are you?
Then we'd better
maintain visuaI contact.
Good evening.
HeIIo, sir.
Hey.
You mind?
No.
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.
- HeIIo.
- Don't ''heIIo'' me.
I need your name, soIdier.
I'm WiII.
- You are?
- I'm her roommate.
The commanding officer
sent me out with rations.
But unfortunateIy, it's vegetarian.
So, personaIIy, I'd rather eat sand.
Thanks for the tip, bro.
Hey.
I'd better get going.
I'm supposed to be at the aquarium.
Me too.
Not hard-to-get again.
SeriousIy, Ronnie. You read ToIstoy.
You take up arms
to defend innocent sea turtIes.
The ice-cube act's not working.
Let's try it again.
Last night was fun.
- Best first date of my Iife.
- It was not a date.
We couId make it one, if you
don't mind coming to work with me.
- It's kind of cooI, huh?
- It's incredibIe.
- So big.
- Try cIeaning it.
It must be pretty cooI,
swimming with aII the fish.
- You shouId see it from in here.
- Maybe I wiII someday.
Yeah.
Give me a hand up?
I'm gonna kiII you!
Dude!
- Where you been?
- I'm sorry, man. She's such a kIutz.
- She feII in the tank five times.
- That is not true!
- Ronnie, Scott.
- Hi.
We got the tournament coming up.
Let's go.
- Want to grab me a water?
- Fine. I'II be back in a minute.
Wet hair?
Let me guess.
He took you to the aquarium
and did his whoIe
underwater fish-man show for you.
Were you impressed?
- Do I know you?
- I'm a friend of WiII's.
But, you know, WiII has Iots of friends.
He makes us aII feeI speciaI.
For a IittIe whiIe.
Bitch.
There you go.
OK. Spread it out a IittIe.
Good job! ExceIIent.
- I didn't burn a hoIe through it.
- No, you didn't.
Hey, Dad.
Do you and Mom ever taIk
about getting back together?
Jonah, your mom's about to get married.
So? You have dibs.
You married her first.
Yes, I did. And it was a good marriage.
It was. It Iasted a Iong, Iong time.
We have two great kids out of it.
It's just...
You know, Iove's not aIways...
That's not aIways enough.
It's probabIy...
...hard to understand.
What has one eye, speaks French
and reaIIy Ioves cookies?
Are you taIking...
Are you taIking about Iove?
OK, OK. Cookies. Very good.
I changed the subject to cookies.
Is that cooI?
Yeah. I'II get them.
Is everything OK?
Hey. You never came back for me.
Ronnie?
- Just go away! OK?
- What's wrong?
Go away!
Ronnie, what happened? Ronnie!
I'm sorry, sir.
CouId you teII me what's going on?
That wouId require my understanding
how the femaIe brain works,
which I don't, but if you'd Iike
to come in and be cIueIess together,
you're more than weIcome.
- That's OK. I'II just wait out here.
- Yeah.
How Iong you think he'II stay?
- Why don't you go ask him?
- He's not my boyfriend, he's hers.
He's not my boyfriend, either.
Do you think he'II
stay out there aII night?
That's hard to say.
- A doIIar says he is.
- A doIIar?
OK, you're on.
Let's make it interesting. Two doIIars.
Two bucks. He's not staying there.
What if he stays out there forever?
What if he never Ieaves and then dies?
Yeah, and his corpse
is eaten by a bunch of raccoons.
And then he stiII doesn't Ieave,
'cause that's how powerfuI his Iove is.
What is wrong with you two?
TurtIes. TurtIes eat his corpse.
You need to Ieave.
You're freaking out my IittIe brother.
Not untiI you teII me what happened.
Was it AshIey?
I saw you taIking to her.
What did she say?
- Just Ieave, aII right?
- TeII me what she said to you.
WiII, I did not come here
for some stupid summer romance
with some stupid IocaI boy
that has done this
with a thousand other girIs.
- What?
- AshIey toId me about
aII the girIs you've been with.
So I don't want to be just the next girI
in your IittIe parade of girIs, WiII.
Going on the same date,
doing the exact same thing.
I think that's why it wouId
just be better if we just end it.
End it?
End what?
Ronnie, yes, OK, I went out
with other girIs before I met you.
That's the point. It was before I
met you! How can you be mad about that?
Don't you dare make this about me. You
and I both know this is not my fauIt...
You're not Iike the other girIs.
What just happened?
- Your sister just got kissed.
- Dad!
- WeII, you did. Look at her.
- No!
- Jonah! Look at that face.
- Dad!
Your sister... Hey!
Let's write a song about being kissed!
- I'm going to be sick.
- Ronnie got kissed
- Stop it!
- OK, OK.
- Are you OK?
- Yes, yes, but...
What?
Wow.
- I'm going to sIeep.
- It's stiII there.
- I hate you.
- Wow.
Stop!
Stop!
Put me down!
I can't beIieve you're
carving our name into the tree.
- What's your middIe initiaI?
- I'm not teIIing you.
This is reaIIy Iame.
-"L."
-"L..."
And make it Iook nice.
- I Iike this song.
- OK.
Man, wow.
You can reaIIy sing.
Is there anything eIse
I don't know about you?
No!
Just go with it. We got it.
No!
No!
- Where are we going?
- Just a IittIe shortcut. Trust me.
- How's it going out there?
- Oh, yeah.
You know, it's getting kind of dark.
This is usuaIIy the part
where the guy with the chainsaw
comes out from behind the trees
and hacks us to pieces.
CouId you just give it some gas, pIease?
OK, a IittIe harder.
OK, OK!
- No, pIease! No, no.
- Where are you going? Come here.
I'm gonna get you.
Come back over here!
Where did you go?
WiII, I'm serious.
WiII, I am not meeting your famiIy
for the first time Iooking Iike this.
It's fine. They're not home.
Besides, I'm not taking you
to the movies Iike that.
Got a reputation to maintain.
Wow.
- Hello?
- Hey, George.
- Hello, Will.
- What are we doing?
Who's George?
WiII, where are we? GraceIand?
Wait. Do you work here too?
This is your house? You Iive here?
You're rich?
WiII, you toId me that your dad
owned a brake shop!
He does. He just happens
to own 300 more just Iike it.
- No, no, I am not going in there.
- Yes, you are.
Not Iooking Iike this!
What if somebody sees me?
- Let go.
- Nope.
- Let go.
- You Iet go!
- Why didn't you teII me?
- What difference does it make?
HeIIo.
Mom. I thought you
and Dad were going out.
We decided to come back earIy.
This is Ronnie.
Hi.
Perhaps you shouId hose off in back.
It's coId.
Here, do my hair.
Go.
These are WiII's sister's.
They shouId fit you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Here, turn around.
CoId!
It's a famiIy tradition. Both my parents
went to coIIege at VanderbiIt.
Tom and I actuaIIy met there.
Didn't we, Tom?
And now, our WiIIiam
wiII go there as weII.
- Where wiII you be going, Ronnie?
- I'm not...
...going anywhere.
I mean, I don't reaIIy have
anywhere pIanned for me, or...
I just haven't figured out
the whoIe coIIege thing yet.
But...
WiII, pass Ronnie some roast beef.
- No, thank you.
- I toId you, Ronnie's a vegetarian.
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- Just reasons.
I mean, it's not that I don't
Iike peopIe that Iike meat.
I mean, they're fine. Just that...
- How you been, Dad?
- Oh, I been good. Good.
You know, I was going through
some of Mikey's stuff the other day.
- And if you have time...
- That's enough, Tom.
WeII, she's a Iot prettier
than you described her, WiII.
Thank you, Dad.
You bringing her to the wedding?
He didn't teII you? His sister's
getting married in a coupIe of weeks.
No, I don't think you
did mention that, WiII.
- WouId you Iike to come?
- WiII?
Your sister toId me
that you were bringing AshIey.
I sent out her invitation
just yesterday.
- Ronnie, this is siIIy.
- Drop it, WiII.
I can't drop it. You're mad.
- I'm not mad.
- You're mad.
I'm not! You want to go to your sister's
wedding with your ex-girIfriend,
- it's not a big deaI.
- Not as a date.
She's a friend of my sister's.
I said it was OK if she came.
HonestIy, it's not a big deaI
because I don't want to go
to some wedding
where I don't know anybody.
- Ronnie...
- And you just forgot to mention
you're going to VanderbiIt.
You toId me you're going to CoIumbia.
No, I didn't.
I toId you I was accepted to CoIumbia.
Ronnie, it's compIicated, OK?
My parents are...
- Not a good time to disappoint them.
- What's compIicated? It's your Iife.
- Go to the coIIege that you want to.
- It's not that simpIe.
Look, we don't have to do this.
- What do you mean?
- Maybe you shouId find someone
that's more suited to your IifestyIe.
You know, with her own rich parents,
- her own perfect mansion...
- Ronnie,
there is nothing perfect
about that house.
Can you not see that? My parents
are hoIding on by a thread.
Perfect? Nothing's been perfect
in my famiIy for a Iong time.
I had a brother. Mikey.
He died Iast year.
How?
Car accident.
My mom was driving.
Mikey and I were in the back seat,
goofing off, pIaying Mercy.
We were being idiots.
She turned around to teII us to stop,
and she Iost controI of the car.
He was kiIIed instantIy.
It's just so hard
to feeI happy in that house.
It's the onIy reason
I didn't invite you to the wedding.
I went out with those girIs
because I was
trying to feeI something again.
No one has made me feeI
Iike you do, Ronnie.
I don't want to Iose you.
I Iove you, WiII.
I Iove you too.
And, since you asked...
...there is something
that you don't know about me.
Come here.
What are we doing here?
Hey. Did you have a good time?
What?
I pIayed today.
That's...
That's good. How did it feeI?
Like I never stopped.
Dad...
I'd probabIy taIk about this with
a girIfriend if I had one here, but...
...I don't, so...
So you want to taIk? You want to taIk?
Here we go. Let's taIk.
Yeah?
So you... you Iike this guy?
You Iike him... You Iike him a Iot?
I Iike him more than a Iot.
- ReaIIy?
- Is that crazy?
WeII, a IittIe, but...
...Iove is, Ronnie.
Crazy... a IittIe.
Thank you.
Good night, Dad.
Dad!
- Hey!
- There she is.
Look, a shopIifter and an arsonist.
I'm sorry. Did you not know
about your dad and the church?
- Hey! Hi.
- Hey, Jonah.
- This is so cooI.
- It is cooI.
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Dad.
OK.
What's up?
Keep your head in the game, brother.
Got it?
Yeah!
Good game, man.
Yeah!
Here you go.
Come on. Open it!
Dad!
Dad, you're right.
I got invited to the wedding.
- That's great, and...
- Thank you.
Since I know you have nothing to wear
to a fancy BIakeIee mansion to-do...
- I wasn't gonna ask you.
- Forget it.
Besides, I never got a chance
to get you a prom dress.
- Not that you went.
- No.
Why do you come here so much?
I spent haIf my chiIdhood
in this buiIding.
I Ioved it here. I stiII do.
Then why do peopIe
say you burned it down?
- You heard that?
- Is it true?
Yes.
I was the Iast one in here that night.
I'd come in here to pIay the piano.
The next thing I remember is waking up
across the street
after the firemen had carried me out.
- How did it start?
- I...
Just stupid. There were some candIes
burning, I had faIIen asIeep, and...
- Dad.
- I might have been a IittIe confused.
I was taking medicine
that my doctor had given me...
- Medicine? What doctor?
- Ronnie, it's OK.
It's OK now. I'm fine.
This was Iast year. I'm fine.
- You're OK?
- Yes.
OK.
He thinks that he did it.
My dad thinks that he's the one
that burned down the church.
I'm sure he didn't do it.
It's just... just peopIe taIking.
Can we taIk?
What's up?
- What's up, WiII?
- You got to come cIean about the fire.
You didn't just say that.
Her father thinks he did it. PeopIe in
town think he did it. You know that.
How Iong you known this girI?
You've known me your entire Iife.
And you know that, if you say anything
to anybody about that night,
my Iife is over.
They'II say it was arson, WiII,
and you know that.
I'm going back to work.
Just Iet it go, aII right?
I just want my money, OK?
I don't have it, Marcus,
and you know that.
- Just get it. Just get it. OK?
- PIease.
- Hey!
- I'II get it.
Excuse me! Excuse me.
We're taIking over here, OK?
- BIaze, are you OK?
- I said get the heII out of here!
- BIaze!
- Just go away!
Marcus! Stop!
I'm not running
a damn homeIess sheIter!
- Don't go!
- I want my money.
- Don't go. Stop!
- Get off the car!
- Off the car!
- Don't Ieave me!
- I have nowhere eIse to Iive!
- Shut up!
Don't go!
Great! Great! Do you see what you did?
Are you happy now? God!
- You don't deserve that, BIaze.
- You don't know me, OK?
You don't know anything.
You just don't get it.
Dad says Iunch is ready.
I can't eat. I got to find something
to wear to the wedding.
What happened
to the money Dad gave you?
If you teII him, I kiII you, OK?
I was on my way to buy the dress and...
I gave the money away.
What?!
Don't worry about it.
Wow, you may be oIder,
but I am so much smarter than you.
- Where did you get aII that?
- Where to begin...
This is for when I toId Dad
I didn't see you at the festivaI.
This is what I won pIaying Iiar's poker.
Remember when you snuck
in past curfew in New York?
That's for that.
This is for the guy with the tattoo...
OK, that's enough. I get it.
I can't take your Iife savings.
Knowing you, there's a Iot more
where that came from.
And besides, I Iike WiII.
I don't want him breaking up with you
'cause you Iook crappy at a wedding.
Thank you.
- I don't think he'II Iike it.
- I Iike it.
- You can't wear that to a wedding!
- I Iike it!
- Save me some cake, man.
- Yeah.
Yo.
Hey, no funny business.
I don't think you can actuaIIy
try funny business at a wedding, sir.
You can definiteIy
try funny business at a wedding.
- I've done it.
- I see.
Kind of makes this
a mixed message, then.
- Hands off, OK?
- Yes, sir.
Ronnie.
Do I Iook aII right?
Yeah.
Do you, PhiIip Louis,
take this woman, Megan BIakeIee,
to be your IawfuIIy wedded wife
as Iong as you both shaII Iive?
- I do.
- You may now kiss the bride.
- Hey, BIaze.
- Hey.
Look, I...
I didn't deserve it, what you did
the other day, but... thank you.
- It's OK.
- I broke up with him.
Marcus. You're right,
he's totaIIy a jerk.
- And I moved out.
- Good for you.
Yeah.
OK, weII, I shouId get back to work.
I'II see you around then, OK?
Thank you.
- You're a good dancer.
- And you're a Iiar.
- You're aIso the prettiest one here.
- And now I know you're Iying.
Get away from me, Marcus! I mean it!
- You think you can just Ieave?
- Yes! We're done!
Look, I got your note. I didn't Iike it.
We're done when I say we're done.
Marcus, what are you doing here?
- Hey, just stay out of this, rich boy.
- I want you to Ieave.
- WiII? Who are these peopIe?
- I got it.
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- You peopIe.
You peopIe just think you're
so much better than me.
- BIaze, waIk away from him.
- No, no, no. You stay.
This is his sister's wedding,
for God's sake.
You're Ieaving. Get out of here.
Suit yourseIf then.
- Hey! Get in your truck!
- What?
- How about now?
- AII right, man, aII right.
I changed my mind.
I don't want her. I want her.
She seems Iike she'd be pretty fun
to have around for the summer.
- Huh, WiIIiam?
- Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?!
- WiII!
- Ronnie!
WiII! WiII!
That's enough! Get up!
WiII...
Just take the girI home.
Both of them. Just cIear out.
- WeII, that was fun.
- Yeah.
Think I finaIIy won your mom over!
Hey, guys! Dad thinks the turtIes
are gonna hatch tonight. Come on!
- AII right, Iet's go.
- We don't want to miss it!
- Get out here!
- We're coming!
- Jeez, you guys are a mess!
- Thanks.
- What did he say?
- Come on!
- Oh, my God.
- Look at them.
- BeautifuI.
- So cooI.
- They're amazing.
- They're awesome!
- Why are you doing that?
- To heIp them get to the sea.
- I'm gonna get another Iight.
- OK.
- I want one.
- I can't beIieve that we saved them.
Daddy!
CaII 91 1 . Daddy!
I'm gonna need a rush on this.
Hey.
You shouId go home and change.
You'II scare the nurses.
What you said before... are you sure?
We'II make him as comfortabIe as we can,
but the cancer has spread to his Iungs.
- How Iong?
- It's hard to know.
But we're not gonna quit, OK?
I want to teII you something.
When your father reaIized
how serious his condition was
a coupIe months ago,
he asked that we cut back
on his medication.
Why?
Because he wanted to be here.
ReaIIy be here
with you and your brother.
That's what he said.
WeII, this wasn't on the caIendar.
- Ronnie...
- You Iied to me, Dad.
- I didn't Iie.
- Yes, you did, Dad.
You said you were fine.
You're not fine! That was a Iie!
I hoped.
I didn't Iie.
It's not the same thing.
- It's aII right to be angry.
- Good.
Is this why you
brought me here this summer?
Is it? So you wouIdn't
have to be aIone whiIe...
Why didn't you teII us?
It's not what
I wanted this time to be about.
- WeII, it is now, Daddy!
- No, it's not.
It's just another...
...part of a terrific summer.
Not one of the better parts, I admit.
- Love you.
- Sweetie, I Iove you too.
Come here.
I Iove you, Daddy.
You want some cookies, bro?
Why won't anyone
teII me what's going on?
Jonah, I think Ronnie and your dad
wiII taIk to you as soon as they can.
Why don't you teII me now?
WeII, it's compIicated.
Can I come and see him yet?
Yeah. He's waiting for you.
Come on.
He's never gonna
get to see him grow up.
Jonah!
- Dang it!
- What are you doing?
- I can't reach it!
- Get down from there!
- Get away!
- What happened to you?
- Just get away!
- Get down!
- Hey, hey!
- Get away!
- Hey, what's going on?
- Stay away! I can do it!
Me and Dad have been working
on this aII summer!
Me and Dad. Not you.
AII you cared about
was the stupid turtIes
and your stupid boyfriend!
I was with him every day!
And now... Dang it!
Now I can't reach things,
and I need to finish this
so Dad wiII get better!
- We'II heIp you.
- You don't know how!
WiII you show us?
Yeah.
- That's good, right?
- Yeah.
What?
Ronnie, I need you to take me home.
OK.
We just have to stop here for a second.
We finished it.
Of course, I had to train an assistant,
but we did it.
You did good, Joe-boy. ReaIIy.
PIease.
OK.
We were behind the church, sir.
We were just goofing around
and drinking... and stuff.
And then Marcus
and his guys showed up.
And that's when WiII Ieft.
And... then we started...
We started pIaying around with...
- Fire?
- Yeah.
We shouId have toId you sooner, sir.
That's my fauIt.
WiII wanted to teII the poIice
right away, and I begged him not to.
But we're gonna go
right after we're done here.
No, don't do that.
PeopIe think it was you, sir.
Yeah... they do.
They wiII. So what?
It's... It's fine. ReaIIy.
I don't want you to do that, OK?
This stays between us.
Thank you, sir.
- OK?
- Thank you.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Ronnie!
- You were there?
- I wanted to teII you.
- You saw what it did to him.
I know! I tried to get Scott to fess up.
Why didn't you say something?
It's not that simpIe.
It wasn't about me! Scott's a good guy.
I don't care, WiII!
You knew how guiIty my dad feIt,
and you Iet him feeI that way!
Just go off to that coIIege that your
parents have picked out for you.
Go find some other girI that makes
you feeI aIive for five minutes!
- One that can stand to be near you.
- Stop.
Don't touch me. WiII!
Don't touch me!
You're a coward, WiII.
You're a coward, and you're a Iiar.
And I don't trust you.
I don't want you near me.
And I don't want you near my dad.
Go.
Go.
- I Iove you.
- I Iove you too.
I Iove you too.
Are you packed?
I'm not going with you, Mom.
I'm gonna stay here with Dad.
He's gonna get worse.
A Iot worse.
And in a few weeks, he...
- I don't care.
- Honey.
Your dad doesn't want you guys
to see him Iike this.
AII I did aII summer was fight with him.
- I was so mean to him.
- No, no, baby.
I promise you,
it meant the worId
to him to have you here.
Look, Mom. I'm gonna stay.
Hey, buddy. You OK?
Are you gonna say goodbye?
I reaIIy don't want to hear it.
Good, 'cause I'm not gonna say it.
I'm not gonna say goodbye,
because I'm not going anywhere.
OK?
Come here.
Every time a Iight shines
through that window we buiIt...
...or any window at aII...
...that's me, OK?
I'm not going away.
Dear Ronnie, I miss the hours
we spent together at the piano.
I miss being your teacher.
I know you see me as having le you,
but when your mother and I split up,
I was in a lot of pain.
I just needed to come home.
I regret moving away from you
and Jonah more than anhing.
I hope you'll forgive me.
Your mom tells me you
completely failed your SATs,
but I know how smart you have to be
to get every single question wrong.
Congratulations, Ronnie.
I've told you before that none of what
happened beeen your mother and me
had anhing to do with you or Jonah.
Love is fragile, Ronnie.
And we're not always
its best caretakers.
We just muddle through
and do the best we can
and hope this fragile thing survives,
against all odds.
He's probabIy started coIIege by now.
Do you miss him?
What he did was wrong, Dad.
Yeah.
It was.
I can teII you this:
- He misses you.
- I doubt it.
You don't even know who you are, Ronnie.
Who am I?
You are the kindest, sweetest...
...most beautifuI daughter
in the whoIe worId.
Thank you, but you're
kind of obIigated to say that, Dad.
Yeah, it is in the handbook.
I don't have too many Iectures
Ieft on my timecard,
so I reaIIy want you to hear this, OK?
Someday, you are
gonna open your heart,
and you're gonna pIay again.
And it's not gonna be
to make your mother happy.
And it's not gonna be to make me happy.
It'II be for you.
Because... music and...
...love...
...they're gonna bring you joy.
Thank you.
How's that song coming, Iazy bones?
WeII, I'm not sure...
...I can finish it.
My hands.
Do they hurt, Dad?
Yeah.
They do.
You OK?
I can't do it, Mom.
Look, you have a right to shut down.
Just, pIease, don't push me away.
It's what I do, Mom.
I push peopIe away.
I pushed WiII away too.
We're not perfect. Any of us.
We make mistakes, we screw up,
but then we forgive and we move forward.
Honey, at Ieast
you have the courage to feeI.
You feeI everything so deepIy.
You're your father's daughter.
OK.
Thank you aII for coming.
A Iot of you have known my dad
since he was a kid.
I wrote a speech.
A few, actuaIIy.
Me and my dad,
we had a different Ianguage.
A Iove that we aIways shared.
And I know that...
That's the one that he'd want me
to share with aII of you guys today.
Hi, Daddy.
Ronnie, I'm reaIIy sorry for your Ioss.
Hey.
Look, thank you for everything.
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.
I reaIIy appreciate
everything you did, though.
Thank you.
Hey.
It was beautifuI, what you pIayed.
It was Dad's.
- I finished it for him.
- I know he Iiked it.
Thank you for coming, WiII.
It meant so much to me.
Ronnie, I have someone
I'd Iike for you to meet.
I want to introduce you
to Tommy Hampton.
He taught your father...
Ronnie, I'm so sorry about everything.
I'm sorry, too.
PeopIe make mistakes, WiII.
Even the peopIe that we Iove.
I've decided to go to JuiIIiard.
Yeah, I heard. That's great news.
How's VanderbiIt?
It's a reaIIy good schooI.
Yeah. I'm not sure it's for me, though.
- What do you mean?
- I'm thinking of maybe transferring
to CoIumbia next semester.
So the girI I Iove can
watch me make a few more mistakes.
What do you think about that?
