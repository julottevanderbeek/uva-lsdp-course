SCOTT:  Teen Wolf...
- What are they?
- Dread Doctors.
STILINSKI:
You know it wasn't Kira.
I'm just going to have to kill her again.
I'm here for a pack.
- You gotta give her the bite.
- No.
-
-
Success...
Imminent.
DR. VALACK:
LYDIA:
DR. VALACK:
-
- Stay focused, Lydia.
What did you do to me?
DR. VALACK: I've amplified your abilities.
Something that might just
save the lives of your friends.
Now focus on the bridge...
On Theo.
Why did he let his sister die?
- I don't know.
- You don't see it yet.
Search for it, Lydia.
Keep looking.
LYDIA:
He wanted her heart.
DR. VALACK: There's no
record of a heart condition.
But a transplant
would make Theo a Genetic
Chimera like the others.
The hypothermic conditions
would keep the organ viable.
Theo.
DR. VALACK:
-
Why do you care?
Because Theo was a first step
in the right direction
for the Dread Doctors.
Think of who they are.
Para scientists who have
prolonged their lives
and twisted the laws of
nature in pursuit of one goal.
The creation of the perfect killer.
But Theo doesn't know who the success is.
The last Chimera.
It doesn't matter.
There's a reason they chose him,
a reason he failed, a reason
they changed their methods
and a reason they finally succeeded.
It all starts with Theo.
-
-
Visiting hours are well past over.
We're not here to visit.
We're here for Lydia Martin.

DR. VALACK:
LYDIA: Scott and Stiles
found out that night.
DR. VALACK:
LYDIA:
There was too much going on.
Liam had almost killed Scott.
Kira was still gone.
Malia was trying to find The Desert Wolf.
You were missing.
And Sheriff Stilinski was dying...
DR. GEYER: All right, we've got a
liver lac and perforated intestine.
Where's my son?
We're taking care of you, Sheriff, but
you have to keep your oxygen mask on.
Contact the blood bank and type and
cross match for four units of O neg.
-  Where's my son?
-
Where's Stiles?
NURSE: Stilinski, right?
You said his insurance was
with the county? He's a Deputy?
No, he's the sheriff,
he's the county sheriff. Okay.
He's covered. I mean he should be covered.
-
- I'll take care of it.
I texted Scott.
He's coming as soon as he can.
- I can call Malia.
- No, no, no.
Don't, don't call anyone.
NURSE: Is there anyone
else we need to notify?
A next of kin?
No, it's me.
It's just me.
PARRISH: What's happening?
You're a harbinger of death, Jordan.
Don't you know?
Know what?
Someone's dying.
- What are you talking about?
-
I can't say how I know,
but Lydia Martin is missing.
Parrish, you're missing.
And some people here are really
confused by your behavior, me included.
I know and I'm going to try to explain it.
But I need you to find
whoever's available...
Parrish, no one's available.
Do you have any idea what's going on?
The high school sign somehow
ended up in one of the hallways.
The library is completely wrecked.
There might be a prehistoric
animal running around the streets,
and I am starting to seriously
think about a transfer.
Okay, listen. I promise I'm
gonna explain what I can later.
But, right now, I've got to find Lydia.
- I have to find her.
Lydia!
Lydia!
STILINSKI:
-
He's okay.
Dr. Geyer is stitching him up right now.
- Okay, I wanna see him.
- Okay, okay.
The anesthesia needs to wear off.
It's gonna be at least two hours.
Okay, yeah, but everything's gonna
be okay though, I mean, he's okay?
Mmm. He's gonna be just fine.
Oh, thank God.
PARRISH: Scott, wake up.
Scott.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You're bleeding.
It's not that bad.
Why are you here?
- I need your help.
- With what?
With her.
PARRISH: I found her out in the woods...
Her body was freezing.
She was practically hyperthermic.
But that wasn't even the worst part.
A sheriff's badge.
No.
It's a warning.
What do you think you're doing?
Someone's got
to tell her about Hayden.
No. Somebody doesn't have to be you.
All right, especially looking like this.
I mean, what if they think you killed her?
Maybe I did.
You didn't.
And while the last few hours
haven't been your best...
This isn't the way to fix it.
She's going to find out,
and it's not gonna hurt
any less coming from you.
What?
It's Hayden.
It's her scent.
She's here.
You held her body
in your arms.
You... you watched Parrish
carry her out of the hospital.
She's... she's gone...
It was her. It's where it was.
Hey, come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Help! Get someone to help me. Quick.
I need help. I've got an 18-year-old
female, potentially hypothermic.
-
-
STILES: What do you mean you don't know?
Two hours ago, he was fine.
Now it looks like somebody
took a baseball bat to his neck.
There could've been some minor internal.
Did you say, "Minor internal?"
- Since when is anything internal minor?
-
MELISSA: Stiles...
STILES: I need to know what's
going on with him, okay?
Dr. Geyer, somebody needs
to tell me what's happening.
Somebody needs to tell me
what's happening to him!
We don't know.
-
-
Where were you? You trusted
him. You believed him.
- Right, huh? So, where were you?
- Hey, hey, hey...
Where the hell were you?
- Stop it!
-
Okay, all right, all right.
Your dad's not the only one who got hurt.
Oh, you'll heal.
I'm not talking about me.
NATALIE: Everything's going
to be all right, Lydia.
We're going to get you
the best medical care.
The best doctors.
The best everything.
No.
No, you don't.
You're not coming in here.
Get out!
Just wait, wait. I think
I know who did this, okay.
I just need to look at
the back of her neck.
I know who did this.
You. All of you! Get out!
Come on, please. You
just gotta listen to me.
- You just gotta check the back...
- Just get out!
- Just check the back of her neck.
- Out!
Oh, God.
I told you to stay in the car.
I told you to stay in the car.
It could be a side effect of shock.
She's catatonic.
It was Theo digging his
way through her mind.
Why would he do that?
What is he looking for?
The same thing he's always
looking for. An advantage.
So what did he gain by
trying to kill Stilinski?
It left me alone with Liam.
Theo wanted to make sure no one would
be there to stop him from killing me.
Okay, so he gutted my dad as a distraction.
We need to find this kid.
Isn't that a little dangerous?
Especially since he almost killed my kid?
Yeah, but he said he
didn't want my dad to die.
And you believe him?
He told me where to find him.
So, maybe he also knows how to save him.
What do you want to do? Talk to him?
If it saves my dad, then yeah.
I'll come with you. He
doesn't know that I'm alive.
Maybe that gives us an advantage.
He'll know you're there.
I just need to talk to him. Not fight him.
Stiles, you can't go alone.
Does anyone even know how to find him?
STILES: We don't have to find him.
He'll come to me.
DR. FENRIS: She'll be well
taken care of, Ms. Martin.
It's a very different place now.
She'll be safe there.
She'll be safe.
Just two signatures, Ms. Martin.
PARRISH: Ms. Martin!
I promise I'll look after her personally.
- Ms. Martin
- DR. FENRIS: She'll be safe there.
Okay.
Ms. Martin. Ms. Martin, who was that?
What were you signing?
She'll be safe there.
What do you mean? What did you do?
I did what I had to.
I guess we're all telling the truth now.
You killed my best friend?
Let's be honest, Stiles.
Was he still really your best friend?
Are you going to let my father die?
If I wanted him to die I wouldn't
have told you where you can find him.
Then why are they saying
his body is shutting down?
That some toxin's poisoning him
and they don't know how to stop it.
I'm not the bad guy, Stiles.
I'm just a realist.
I'm a survivor. If you knew
the things that I know...
Yeah, but what do you know?
I know what's coming.
I know what the Dread Doctors created.
And I know what Parrish is.
No, there have not been any other
bodies brought in tonight, thank God.
No one named Hayden?
Mason, take him home.
It's 6:00 in the morning.
Dad, you're sure there have
been no other dead bodies?
Both of you. Home. Now.
We're not going home, are we?
No.
Well, we both know where Hayden's body is.
And if you want to find
her, you're going to have to
find the Nemeton.
Okay.
Let's find the Nemeton.
I need to learn to shut up.
THEO: Lydia figured it out.
I saw it in her memories.
Right after you drove her out of her mind.
Collateral damage.
But if she's right about Parrish,
then things around here
are gonna get a lot worse.
- I don't care.
- You should.
Because if your dad does
survive he's not gonna be
sheriff of anything much longer.
What's happening to him?
Hey, tell me!
STILINSKI:
You gotta get up now.
Stiles. Stiles.
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.
- You blacked out.
- I'm okay.
Did you get anything from him?
Nothing. He was calm the entire time.
What about his heart?
I heard it jump, but only
once, and only for a second.
That doesn't mean he was lying.
Not really.
The rest of the time it was steady.
When did it jump? What was I talking about?
It was when you said that
your dad was poisoned.
That could be something.
A jump could mean surprise, right?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
So why would he be surprised
that my dad's still dying?
Oh, wait.
He didn't say that he was the
one who attacked your dad, did he?
No.
Well, then this means it
was probably someone else.
Another Chimera.
Chimera...
- Stiles?
- Yeah, I can do the rest myself.
You don't even know where to start.
All we know
that it's another Chimera.
- Do you even know where you're headed?
-
Come on. Let me help. I can
find the clues that you can't.
You can't do this alone, okay. You need me.
You need all of us.
I can get more help. I can text Liam.
Liam just tried to kill you.
Okay, then at least let me help.
You believed him?
You trusted him, too.
Theo got to all of us.
You know, you don't
even know the real story.
SCOTT: I don't need to.
All that matters right now is your dad.
Come on, Stiles.
We survived an Alpha pack,
a Dark Druid, professional assassins.
We can survive Dread
Doctors and Chimeras, too.
We're not looking for a missing Chimera.
We're looking for a missing teenager.
SCOTT:
MASON: Liam.
All right.
This is the one.
You see these.
These are Ley Lines.
They're mapped according
to telluric currents.
Stiles said that he and Lydia
were looking at the intersections.
Probably... This one.
But they never found it.
They kept going out there to look,
but they said the Nemeton
has to want to be found.
It's a supernatural tree
that has to want to be found
in order for you to see it?
Yeah.
That's awesome.
We should just make a copy...
I'm going to find a way
to get her out of there.
Even if I have to break through the walls.
Good luck with that Deputy.
She's a pretty little thing, isn't she?
That pretty little thing could
shatter your skull with her voice
if someone decided to teach her how.
There was a call a few
hours ago about a sophomore
from Beacon High who
never came home last night.
- What's his name?
- Noah Patrick.
Now we can catch his scent.
- You called her.
- We need all the help that we can get.
I should be calling everyone.
And I know what this kid looks like.
- MASON: This is it.
- There should be a clearing here.
Maybe the clearing doesn't
want to be found either.
I couldn't save her.
No one could.
I was standing right there.
Melissa did everything
medically possible...
While I was trying to kill Scott.
You can't take all the blame.
I mean, there was, like, 800
extenuating circumstances.
It wasn't just the moon.
Then it was losing Hayden.
In fear,
anger, and Theo took advantage of it.
Or maybe it was just me.
Liam, you're a werewolf.
There was a full moon,
a Super moon.
And you can't let yourself...
What?
The Nemeton's a beacon for
supernatural creatures, right?
Yeah.
So what if it takes a
supernatural creature to find it.
I am a supernatural creature
and I can't find anything.
But you've been looking
with your human eyes.
- Mason...
- What? What?
Look.
I don't see any...
Intense.
MALIA: He didn't want
you to call me, did he?
No.
Is it that bad?
We kind of broke up, I guess.
Yeah, we kind of broke up, too.
Hey, you can tell me
what's going on with you.
I mean besides Stiles.
You can talk to me.
I said I'd help find this kid
and I'm doing it to save Stiles' dad.
Don't ask me to talk.
Well, I'm not asking. I'm offering.
I'm just saying it's okay if you want to.
I know.
I got it. I got his scent.
Melissa, that man in there is dying
and I don't know how to save him.
I went to Harvard Med.
I have degrees lining
the wall of my office.
And I don't have the slightest
clue what's going on here.
If you know something
about this that I don't...
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Nothing seems to faze you.
And not to sound accusatory,
but it's like you know something.
Knowing something is different
from understanding it.
Yeah, I could tell you
things, really bizarre things.
But right now I can't tell you anything
that is gonna save his life.
Then what are we supposed to do?
Keep him alive. For as long as we can.
LIAM: There's only four here.
That means four Chimeras are missing.
I only care about one.
Hayden's alive. She has to be.
MASON: Okay, maybe you're right.
Either way, we gotta
tell someone about this.
We get the cops down here
and they can figure out who's dead,
who's alive and who's whatever.
Sound good?
POLICEMAN: You two.
Stay right where you are.
HAYDEN: That's it. That's
where I found the bodies.
Four of them.
This is Noah's. He was here.
I think he's close.
SCOTT: Guys...
I think we've been down
tunnels like this before
like when we were trying
to find Liam and Hayden.
STILES: Okay, so what?
Maybe, it means we're closer than we think.
Maybe there's something else down here.
Something that we haven't found yet.
Yeah, nothing that helps my dad.
Look, we can't just be standing
around here waiting for something to...
SCOTT: Stiles.
STILINSKI:
Come on.
You gotta get up now.
SCOTT: Stiles.
You still got me.
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.
-
-
Let me go, please, please.
-
-
They're coming.
- You're not going anywhere.
- I said I don't remember.
- You don't remember anything?
- No.
Not when it happens. Not when I change.
You clawed my dad half to death,
okay, and now it's poisoning him.
You're gonna start remembering
every detail right now.
- Scott, I hear them.
- Yeah, I do, too.
Hey, Stiles, get him out of here.
Go to the hospital. Figure
out a way to save your dad.
We're not gonna be able to stop them.
But we can slow them down.
Stiles, go.
We're gonna be okay.
Scott, we're gonna die down here.
No, we're not.
How can you be so sure?
Because you're not the
only one that I called.
ARGENT: Get down.
Run.
Step back. I think I can break through it.
It's just sometimes, most
of the time, I lose control.
So you better step back.
Let's go.
Dr. Geyer! We have to open him up.
What?
There's something inside him.
Something that we didn't see.
- Melissa, we can't just open him up.
- It's a piece of bone.
He's being poisoned by bone marrow.
I know it doesn't make any
sense, I know what it sounds like,
but you have to open him up.
Do it now.
It's okay, Stiles.
You still got me.
He was here.
THEO:
Why don't you tell me how I know that?
Noah's part Berserker.
You're part jaguar. You'll
be drawn to each other.
Is that why I'm here with you?
I saved your life.
What?
I think he's dying.
That means they're going to find him.
Probably already have.
We could've used him.
For what?
What is that?
A symbol.
The symbol of an Alpha and his pack.
Whose pack?
Scott's.
DR. VALACK: It was more
than a symbol, wasn't it?
It was a promise to reunite them.
Yes.
But has Scott done it yet?
Will he be coming for you?
Someone's coming.
But it's not Scott.
You don't wanna do this, Theo.
She's safe in here.
The Dread Doctors don't know
how important she is yet.
She doesn't look good.
COREY: She has a hole in her head.
It's not a good look for anyone.
I can't believe this is
actually a medical establishment.
Pick her up.
We're getting her out of here.
Now what would a pack of
Chimeras want with a Banshee?
I don't want a Banshee.
I'm looking for a Hellhound.
You wanted a Hellhound...
I think you found one.
