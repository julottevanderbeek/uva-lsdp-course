-Original subs: unkown
-Fix: PyrSos_
For my world is as
forbidden as it is fragile.
I certainly wasn't born
to the life of a Geisha.
The first time I knew
my mother was sick,
was when my father threw
the fish back into the sea.
That night we went hungry, to
understand emptiness he told us.
Mother always said that my
sister Satsu was like wood.
As rooted to the earth as a Sagura
tree. But she told me I was like water.
Water can carve its
way, even through stone.
And when trapped,
water makes a new path.
-These are the girls from Tanaka?
-Sisters, yes, from Yurida.
This one maybe, the other one no.
Show your respect for mother. You
must not speak, I will answer for you.
Kneel, and head down,
never look her in the face.
-How old are you?
-She’s year of the rooster.
Only nine...
Where is my sister?
Let me see those eyes.
Look at me.
-Too much water.
- But mother, a little water is good to guard against fire.
You wouldn't have to worry about the
okea burning, losing all your people, no....
These country girls! Too
late to send her back now.
Go.
Pumpkin, keep her quiet,
mother is downstairs
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
-Mother will hear you! She's got a bamboo stick.
-I want my sister. Satsu!
I cried too at first.
You know it is easier if you just forget
everything that happened before you came to the okea.
If you impress mother,
and do exactly as she says,
She will send you to
school to be a Geisha.
-A what?
-A Geisha, like Hatsumomo.
You will get to drink
sake, and sleep until noon.
-Where is my sister?
-Probably in another okea in Hanonoke.
Your family sold you to this
house, you live here now.
Outside you wear these, inside these.
We don't display our
naked feet like monkeys.
It's not flesh we're selling here,
This is a Geisha house.
Remember to always honour this okea.
You listen, you learn, now get to work.
Be quiet Hatsumomo is sleeping.
-Pumpkin, when can I go outside?
-Outside the okea? You can't.
It’s not allowed.
How will I find Satsu?
You can't just walk out to
every house in Hanamachi.
Do you know how many there are?
Look.
Tighter!
Chiyo, Chiyo-chan
Come.
Two nights ago, Hatsumomo had to
stay at the Tea-house until dawn,
thats what she told mother.
But she was really here
with a man, the whole...
Why can't you be quiet?!
So, this is the new arrival.
A pity she still stinks of fish.
Stay out of my room.
Your fingers smell .I can't
have you touching my things!
Only reason mother tolerates Hatsumomo
is because she brings in good money.
Never forget it is Hatsumomo
who pays for your supper,
the clothes on your back.
By the time she was twenty, she had
already earned back her purchase price.
She has been the talk of
the Hanamachi ever since.
-These are all hers?
-Certainly not, they belong to the okea.
A Geisha needs an elegant wardrobe,
just like an artist needs ink.
If she's not properly dressed
then she is not a true Geisha.
-Nobody told me what a Geisha is.
-You will find out soon enough.
I have news for you child, mother has determined
that it is off to school with you.
You are to become Geisha!
Chiyo, Pumpkin!
Quick quick, don't be
late, and you will be late.
Go,go.
This way.
Pumpkin, Pumpkin…
I'm going to run, I'm
going to find Satsu.
Not yet you don't.
You will ruin your own
chances, and mine too.
Please,stay with me.
Squid!
Look for your sister's name later!
You are late!
Chiyo, where is granny's food?
Where have you
been? It’s freezing cold!.
Close the window. Hai! .
Chiyo, Chiyo, come quickly.
Hatsumomo is at the bath-house
-Here tidy up.
-But she told me to stay ... !
Hatsumomo does not run this okea.
Look who's in my room...
Did you touch this?
I can just hear the General now why
Hatsumomo, you used to smell of jasmine,
What’s this new perfume? Blowfish?
I told you to never to touch my
things. Can’t you understand why?
Because your general will
say, Hatsumomo you stink!
At least you don't smell as bad as
your sister.You know, she was here...
She came by looking for you.
What?
Was I wrong to ask her to leave?
Please, tell me where she is.
Only if you swear yourself
to me first.Yes? Huh?
Now get out!
Hatsumomo you'll wake the entire
house. Your big sister is thirsty, so am I,
go and get us some beer.
-I'm not in the mood for beer.
-I know what you're in the mood for.
And his name is Koichi
What did you say Korin?
I'm sorry.I forgot.
You're just jealous
someone cares for me!
Guess who this belongs to? A Geisha as desired as
she is ought to keep a closer eye on her clothes.
It’s Mameha's?!
How did you get it? Bribed her maid.
We can't, give it to her.
Chiyo, come, come.
Now then little Chiyo, it is
time to practice your calligraphy.
There.
Remember, you swore yourself to me. Yes.
Don't let anybody see you.
Go, go!
This will teach the great Mameha.
Thieving rat!.
-That kimono was worth more than you.
-Careful, you will hurt yourself more than her.
Let me.
Kneel. What have you done to Hatsumomo?
-I haven't done anything, I promise you.
-Her little trick with than kimono will cost  you.
Whatever you have done to anger
her, you'd be wise to stop, now!
Lie down. I will beat you hard,
So mother does not beat you harder.
I told you not to let anybody see you.
I have kept my promise,
so tell me, where is she?
She is in the next ...
in the house called Tatsuyo.
In the pleasure district.
Trust me little Chiyo,
you will find her.
Tatsuyo? Satsu, Satsu, Satsu…
Satsu, Satsu, no! Satsu! Satsu!
Satsu, Satsu!
Chiyo, what took you so
long? But Satsu, I tried...
I went to your okea weeks ago,
they laughed and turned me away.
Please, I did not know
I’ve missed you so much.
Let’s leave, tonight.
But we need money too.
I know I can steal some, first
thing tomorrow… No, please, tonight!
No, tomorrow, meet me at the
Saturn-May bridge, as soon as it's dark.
Now I have to go.Quickly
before someone catches you.
What if I cannot get away?
Be there Chiyo, we only have one chance.
Once I’ve left I can't go
back.I’ve waited as long as I can.Now go.
What is she doing here? She’s seen us!
Stupid girl, why have you come
back? You’re probably trying to escape!
Get in!
- Koichi please!
-Look at this, we're sneaking around like criminals!
-Koichi don't!
-It's degrading!
-What's going on?
-Koichi…
Who's there?
Go.
Show your face!
Look mother, I caught her stealing.
She was running away
with her sister,the whore!
-You little thief!
-No, she's lying.
After all we've done for her!
I saw her with a man, right
there! His name is Koichi!
Shut up! We should kick her out.
Take her arms.
You are never to see him again, huh?
What do you think? A
Geisha is free to love?
Never! Bolt the gate.No
one is leaving this okea!
Doctor Ohura is very expensive. You
seem to be racking up quite a debt, huh?
Kimono destroyed, Geisha school, rice and
pickles, train ticket,Mr. Bekku, ... all this...
… on top of the money I paid Mr. Tanaka?
And for what? And now I hear
that your sister has run away.
She didn't wait for you and
now she can never come back.
You must forget you
ever had a sister, huh?
We are your only family now.
Dear Satsu and little Chiyo, as one
who was once an orphan child myself,
this humble person is sorry to inform you,that six
weeks after you left for your new life in Myoko…
… the suffering of your honoured
mother came to it's end …
And only a few weeks afterwards your
honoured father departed this world as well.
This humble person feels confident that both your honoured
parents have found their places in paradise.
At the temple there is a poem
called "loss",carved into the stone.
It has three words, but the
poet has scratched them out.
My father and mother had left this
life, my sister I never heard from again.
I had dishonoured the okea,so
mother had other plans for me.
I would pay back my debt,
year,after year,after year.
It is too pretty a day to be
so unhappy. Did you fall down?
Why so shy? Nothing to be ashamed of.
We all stumble from time to time.
You see that enchanting lady in green?
Once, when she was just a miko
, she fell clean off her wooden shoes.
-It's true, I did.
-And now look at her, so elegant!
Mr. Chairman, shouldn't we hurry?We
will miss the beginning.
We see the Spring dances
every year.We can spare a moment.
What's your name? Don't
be afraid to look at me.
Do you like sweet plum or cherry?
You mean to eat?
I like sweet plum myself.
Come.
None of us find much kindness
in this life, as we should.
Both kinds please.
My children wait for these every Spring.
-Now I am a Geisha too.
-So you are.
How did you come by
such surprising eyes?
-My mother gave them to me.
-Generous of her wasn't it?
As you have been to me.
Smile for me won't you?
There now, that is your gift to me.
This will buy your
supper. Now promise me one thing.
Next time you take a tumble, no frowns.
That's better.
In that moment I changed from a
girl, facing nothing but emptiness
to someone with purpose.I saw that to
be a Geisha could be a stepping stone
to something else: a place in his world.
The money the chairman had given me,
could have bought fish and rice for a month,
but I gave it back in prayer,
keeping only his handkerchief.
I asked one day to become a Geisha,
and then somehow, to meet him again.
-Chiyo
-chan? I can't find my coat, did you found it yet?
Pumpkin it's time to go.
I found it.
I couldn't sleep last night I was
so worried about my stupid hair.
Am I lopsided? You look beautiful.
With your hair like that you look
more like a pumpkin than ever.
Don't fold your neck
forward like a tortoise.
She's not ready? We will be late.
Poor pumpkin, her debut and
everybody will be staring at you.
Hurry up. This time, do your ... before you play, when
you make a fool of yourself your big sister gets the blame
Stop crying, your face will run.
Pumpkin!
The winter I turned fifteen
I saw the chairman again,
But that wasn't the only surprise
fate brought me that season.
Along with the snow came
a most unexpected  visitor.
Why is she here?
Chiyo, Chiyo, open the gate!
Now that your beloved granny has
gone you have no need for a maid.
I would never question the great Mameha,
but you could choose anyone in the Hanamachi.
You flatter me, truly.
I would give you my pumpkin if she
weren't already tied to Hatsumomo.
Please I would never dream of asking. Besides,
I can always sell Chiyo to Mrs. Tetsuyo.
With your eye for beauty
and nose for talent,
surely you can see what a
terrible waste that would be.
If you were not the kind hearted
Geisha I know you to be,
then I might think that you were
scheming against Hatsumomo.
Then I'm grateful Mrs. Nita that
you don't have a suspicious mind.
Perhaps you can
pique my interest with...
-Your offer.
I will cover Chiyo's schooling, all
her expenses, until after her debut.
Now I am confident that you are teasing.
I could not be more sincere.
If Chiyo has not repaid her debt
within six months after her debut.
-Impossible, too little time!
- Then I will pay you twice over.
What... ?
-No Geisha could ever...
- I am certain you will not object to one trivial condition.
-Uh yes...?
-If Chiyo erases her debt in the time allowed,
You will not have any part
in her future earnings.
It's too good to be true,
Mameha is up to something.
She isn't in it for the money,
that much is for certain.
Rumour has it, ever since the Prime
Minister bought her misuage
-She's been rich.
Absurd hard to think
that she noticed Chiyo.
-It's that kimono, she remembers how you
destroyed it, now she wants to get even.
An odd picture isn't it?
Hatsumomo sweeping into tea-house after
tea-house with our Pumpkin, and Mameha with our maid.
I'm so far behind, I will
never catch up to you.
-Don’t worry, I will help you.
-Pumpkin!
You are never to speak to her
again, now you  are rivals!
This is how it was, this
tiny world of women,
friend turned against friend.
And now the two greatest
Geisha in Myoko at war over me.
Hatsumomo at my back, Mameha calling,
offering me the chance to become one of
those elegant women I had seen on the bridge.
floating in a silk
kimono, the chairman at my side.
-Chiyo is my new protoge.
-As lovely as her big sister.
And with eyes the colour of rain.
The baron is a very special
man to me, my “Danina,”
someday if you are fortunate,
you will have a patron too.
Don't kneel, you aren't
a servant girl anymore.
Step into the light.
-I see water in you.
-Does that displease you?
Water is powerful. It can wash away
earth, put out fire, and even destroy iron.
But you have not drawn on
those strengths have you?
-About your kimono...
You may apologise if you wish.
Why that is a perfect
bow, for a pig farmer...
Don't drop your head, fingertips together,
elbows in, no weight on the hands.
-Yes.
As for the kimono, I’m no fool Chiyo.
-Hatsumomo cannot tolerate competition
-She is jealous of you...
Not me I'm afraid,
someone closer to home.
Rise.
Not like a horse.
Slide your foot forward.
That's it. Now walk. You
are a magnificent Geisha.
Tell me Chiyo, does Mrs.
Nita ever speak of the future?
Not to me.
Well someday soon she will
have to name an heir.
One of her own Geisha to succeed her.
Strange isn't it that she
hasn't adopted Hatsumomo?
That would be like releasing
a tiger from it's cage.
You have a gift for expression.
And if Mrs. Nita adopts
Pumpkin that is hardly a threat…
… but a young girl
with eyes like rain...
But Mrs. Nita would never choose me.
-On the contrary, that is our goal.
-It is?
Of course. If you do not inherit the
okea, then we will all be at the tiger's mercy.
Water is always in such a
hurry, perhaps that is just as well.
We have no time to lose.
We must transform you.
And what takes years,you
must learn in months.
Say I’m entertaining the baron.
Like so many clients he's trapped
in an arranged marriage.
So in the tea-house when he's
seeking my company instead,
I reward him like this with
a glimpse of my wrist.
Seeing this demure little trace of
naked skin, well it gives him pleasure.
Or when you're sitting down, for the
briefest moment, press your leg against his.
Always by accident,of course.
Mameha, when does a
Geisha choose her patron?
I'm afraid it's the other way around, focus on
your studies Chiyo, music, the art of conversation,
That's the surest way to attract a
patron on your feet, not off them!
Remember Chiyo, Geisha are not
courtesans, and we're not wives.
We sell our skills, not our bodies.
We create another secret
world, a place only of beauty.
The very word Geisha means
artist, and to be a Geisha …
… is to be judged as
a moving work of art.
Agony and beauty, for
us, live side by side.
Your feet will suffer,
your fingers will bleed.
Even sitting and
sleeping will be painful.
You cannot call yourself a true Geisha until you
can stop a man in his tracks with a single look.
-No one can do that.
-Choose someone for me.
The grey hat...
You are ready.
Hurry up, you're not making money.
Standing there gawking at yourself.
For luck.
This binds us together
forever as sisters.
Today you leave your childhood
and cast away your name.
From this day forward you
will be known as Sayuri.
When Mameha granted me my new name,
I felt little Chiyo disappear
behind a white mask with red lips.
I was a miko now, an apprentice Geisha.
From that moment I told myself when I make tea,
when I pour sake, when I dance, when I tie my kimono…
… it will be for the
chairman, until he finds me...
… until I am his.
-Ready?
-Big sister?
Thank you.
Friends, we have the pleasure to witness the
debut of another apprentice Geisha, cheers!
I remember those eyes what was her name?
Sayuri.
Determined isn't she? If there had been a drop of tea in
that tea-pot I believe Sayuri would have gotten it out!
I told you Mr. Baron, it
is her very first time.
What a beautiful dance, yes Pumpkin?
her fans are so hypnotic, that
you may not even notice her feet!
What's her name? Her name is Sayuri.
A name as sweet as she is. I'm afraid
that these days even a common chambermaid…
… can call herself a Geisha. So it's nice to
see such a sincere young apprentice, isn't it?
-Oh yes.
- Surely you would like to thank Hatsumomo for her gracious compliment.
There is so much I would
like to say to Hatsumomo.
Sometimes the smartest
remark is silence.
What better advice to follow
you than your own? Sayuri!
-I was a miko myself once.
- Of course! But it's been such a very long,
long, long... long, long, time.
I shall destroy you.
She can destroy you. She
would spread rumours.
Stalk you from
tea-house to tea-house.
Then steal your clients, all in the hope that
Mrs. Nita adopts Pumpkin instead of you.
-What can we do?
-We've got to outwit her,
to find a place somewhere beyond her reach, where
you can practice your skills without any interference.
-Your first sumo match.
-What?
Today you will meet  Iwamura.
He is head of the Iwamura electric
company in Osaka. My client for years.
We will entertain him and his partner
Nobu. You may find Nobu quite a challenge.
He does not like Geisha.
Be attentive, I will do the rest.
Chairman Iwamura, President Nobu, this
is my new younger sister Sayuri.
Injured in Manchuria, war hero.
Sayuri, is this your first sumo match?
Nobu-san will have to educate you, I
cannot tell one wrestler from the next.
That is the Chairman's diplomatic
way of saying he hates sumo.
Did you notice our contribution?
We are harnessing the power of water to
bring electricity to some of the smaller villages.
It was in the newspaper wasn't it?
Ah, the Chairman's picture, yes, you
compensate for all my shortcomings don't you?
May I ask, How does someone
harness the power of water?
You should never ask an engineer
to explain a thing because he will!
Let the girl watch sumo.
Hatsumomo, that snake! Quick,
turn your attention to Nobu.
But Mameha-san...
Hatsumomo finds him repulsive,
she would never steal him away.
Mislead her, go.
Perhaps Nobu-san would be kind
enough to explain the rules of the match.
Three things matter in
life... … sumo, business, and war,
Understand one, you know them
all. But why should a Geisha care?
You spend your time
plucking strings and dancing.
I humbly beg to differ.
What is sumo but a dance between giants?
What is business but a
dance between companies?
I'd like to know about
every kind of dance.
They are throwing salt
to purify the ring.
That man is Miyagi, the
greatest fighter in Japan.
But he's so tiny! Only
compared to his opponent.
Miyagi may use...
Are you listening? Yes.
Hataki-comi is a movement a smaller
opponent uses to throw a larger opponent off balance.
Victory does not always
belong to the powerful!
Look, there, in his eyes!
I'm afraid our time has come
to a close. Going so soon?
Not yet! I want her to see.
Now that is Hataki-comi! I
see now why you like sumo.
You can never judge a man's
power by his appearance alone.
Mameha! You may bring her again.
I scoured the newspaper for
the Chairman's photograph.
Anything to preserve
our moment together.
A moment, stolen, when I was
forced to turn my attention to Nobu.
In that instant I
felt the world shift...
Along with his picture, I would lock
away my heart, and save it for him.
-Big sister.
-Come here.
Tonight we will deliver a quick
blow to Hatsumomo - Hataki-comi.
-How? -We will meet
Nobu-san at the Sunashima restaurant.
-But first a visit to Dr. Crab.
-Dr. Crab?
It's a little nickname
he's earned over the years.
-Sister!
- Hold still!
I have something in mind, a plan.
Now cut your leg where I've marked it.
-What?!
-Or I will do it for you.
-Have you gone mad?
-Do you trust me or don't you?
Well?
Go ahead, do it!.
Careless with the
sowing scissors were you?
Right through your beautiful
kimono. Such a pity.
It won't leave a scar will
it? Sayuri is a special girl…
… at a very special time in her life.
Yes, with those eyes! You
must be quite a commodity.
Clean cut, won't leave
a mark, I promise.
But I had best prescribe
a bit of antiseptic.
Your honourable sister says
cut your leg? You cut your leg.
She says follow me? You follow
her. My life had turned into a game…
… and only she knew the rules.
At the right moment slip
it to Nobu – discreetly.
He will know what it means.
-You have kept us waiting.
-Please forgive us Nobu-san.
The Chairman thinks I should take more
pleasure in life, music and the theatre.
What is your impression?
It is useless to push
your cart sideways,
one could not wish Nobu-san to
be anyone other than Nobu-san.
I could not agree more. I
owe this man everything.
He gives me too much credit as usual.
Probably, cheers! Cheers!
It is a trinket, I found
it a few days ago...
Nobu-san, I had no idea you were so
sentimental. Call it my “new leaf.”
My mother... my mother, she
used to wear something similar.
You do not like it?
Forgive me, I've never
received a present before.
What a beautiful comb.
Such a joyous moment Sayuri.
You're finally getting what you deserve.
How lovely.
And now will you excuse us please, we
have another engagement, many in fact.
Pumpkin?
You are most kind.
-Now give this one to Dr. Crab.
-Mameha please...
-You're upset?
-I want to trust you I do…
… but you have to tell
me what's going on.
-I am ensuring your future.
-But tell me how, I beg you.
-I am trying to orchestrate a bidding war.
-What for?
-Your most precious attribute.
-And what is that?
Your misuage .
Did mother ever tell you
about the eel in the cave?
Well, every once in a while, a man's
eel likes to visit a woman's cave.
Yes I know. You do?
I live with Hatsumomo.
Well, your cave is untouched... men
like that. We call this misuage .
And to become a full Geisha we must
sell this to the highest bidder.
Did you sell yours?
It was the largest sum ever paid
- Ten thousand yen.
I freed myself from
debt, and so will you.
When you slip the rice-cake to Dr. Crab it is a sign
that says your misuage ,is ripe for sale.
The Dr. has no desire to see
you tonight... or any night.
-Pumpkin! Hatsumomo went to see Dr.
Crab, yes? -I have to go Chiyo-chan.
-Didn't she?
-I do not know.
Of course you know! You
shadow her every step.
-You expect me to betray my big sister.
-Has she made you cruel as well?
-No.
-My Pumpkin always told the truth.
The truth…
Tonight, we went to the tea-house to see Dr. Crab. I
sat outside but I could still hear through the screen...
... and Hatsumomo then said to him “I live in the same Okea as
Sayuri, and did you know that she brings men back to her room?”
“No” he said, “they come in, sailors, and fishermen too.” And
the Dr. looked queezy like he didn't want to hear any more,
But she kept going. And Hatsumomo
said to him “what's the matter?”
“have I told you more than you wanted to
know?” I'm so sorry, I wanted to say something…
… but how could I Chiyo-chan? … how?
Am I really like her?
-Am I?
-Of course not.
-Is Mameha-san cruel to you
too? -No, she's so kind to me...
... but sometimes I worry she's taken
me further from the things I want.
