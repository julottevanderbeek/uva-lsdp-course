I want you to tell me
the truth about Joffrey.
He's a monster.
With the Tyrells beside us,
no one will think of rebelling
for another century.
It would be bad luck
to kill a man on your nameday.
You'll be my new fool.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you know what it takes
to unite
I told them
we were all going to die.
If we don't get out.
Let us go, my father will pay you
whatever you want.
Enough to buy me a new head?
We need to find
Sansa Stark a husband.
Tyrion will do as he's bid and
will marry Ser Loras.
- I am not some brood mare.
- You're my daughter!
My feelings for you
have not changed.
I'm not your lady,
I'm you whore.
He's a Crow.
He'll stab us in the back.
Kill him.
That's a fine little blade.
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?
You got to carry me.
Robb.
The Lannisters send
their regards.
Too late.
You know I didn't have a choice.
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.
Your home.

- Magnificent.
- Mm-hmm.
Looks fresh-forged.
It is.
No one's made a Valyrian
steel sword
since the Doom
of Valyria.
There are three
living smiths
who know how to rework
Valyrian steel.
The finest of them
was in Volantis.
Came here to King's Landing
at my invitation.
Where did you get
this much Valyrian steel?
From someone who no longer
had need of it.
You've wanted one of these
in the family for a long time.
- And now we have two.
- Two?
The original weapon
was absurdly large.
Plenty of steel
for two swords.
Well, thank you.
It's glorious.
You'll have to train
your left hand.
Any decent swordsman
knows how to use both hands.
You'll never be as good.
No.
But as long as I'm better
than everyone else,
I suppose
it doesn't matter.
You can't serve in the Kingsguard
with one hand.
Where's that written?
I can and I will.
The Kingsguard oath
is for life.
The war is over.
The king is safe.
The king is never safe.
How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?
Other knights protected the king
while you were a prisoner.
They will continue
to do so when you go home.
- Home?
- You'll return to Casterly Rock
You are the Lord
of Casterly Rock.
I am the King's Hand.
My place is here.
I don't expect to see
the Rock again before I die.
You know
what they call me?
Kingslayer.
Oathbreaker.
Man without honor.
Now you want me to break
another sacred vow.
You won't be
breaking anything.
There is a precedent
to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.
The king will exercise
that prerogative.
- No.
- No?
No.
I don't believe
I asked you a question.
There's my answer.
If you think your bloody
honor comes before--
My bloody honor
is beyond repair,
but my answer is still no.
I don't want Casterly Rock.
I don't want a wife.
I don't want children.
What do you want?
Supper would be nice.
For 40 years
I've tried to teach you.
If you haven't learned by now,
you never will.
Go.
is the sum of your ambition,
go serve.
I suppose you want
the sword back.
Keep it.
A one-handed man
with no family needs
all the help he can get.
How many Dornishmen
does it take to fuck a goat?
Please don't.
Bronn:
That way, one party is late,
the other party can drink
some ale inside.
This is the Prince of Dorne
we're waiting for,
not one of your
sellsword friends.
If he's so damned important,
how come they sent you to meet him?
There's bad blood between
the Martells of Dorne
and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.
Has been for years.
And just in case
the Martells of Dorne
are looking to spill
some Lannister blood,
- it may as well be yours, eh?
- No need for cynicism.
I happen to be
an accomplished diplomat.
Oh.
Ah, here we are.
Yellow balls?
Wild lemons
on a purple field,
House Dalt of Lemonwood.
A vulture grasping a baby in its talons,
House Blackmont.
A crowned skull,
the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.
Boy knows his
Dornish Houses.
I need a sigil.
And House Martell,
a red sun pierced by a spear?
I don't see it,
my lord.
Well met, my lords.
His Grace King Joffrey
welcomes you in his name.
My lord father, the King's Hand,
sends his greetings as well.
I am Tyrion Lannister
of Casterly Rock,
Master of Coin.
Forgive me.
I don't see Prince Doran
in your company.
The prince's health
forces him to remain at Sunspear.
He sends his brother
Prince Oberyn
Yes, the king will be delighted
to enjoy the company
of a warrior
as renowned as Prince Oberyn
at his wedding feast.
Will he?
And where is
Prince Oberyn?
Arrived before dawn.
Not a man
for welcome parties,
Very well. My lords, these
fine men from the City Watch
will escort you to your
quarters in the Red Keep.
You must be weary
after such a long journey.
Some accomplished
diplomacy that was.
Now where?
We must find Prince Oberyn
before he kills somebody
or several somebodies.
How do you plan on finding
a single Dornishman in a city this big?
You're famous for fucking
half of Westeros.
You just arrived at the capital after
two weeks of bad roads,
where would you go?
I'd probably go to sleep,
but I'm getting old.
Look at this one.
How lovely is she?
Beautiful.
But pale.
They like them pale
in the capital.
Shows they don't
work the fields.
Do I frighten you?
You like?
Timid.
Timid bores me.
You're a bit of mischief,
aren't you?
I think she likes you.
She has good taste.
You're not timid,
are you?
Not timid.
Do you like women?
When they look
like her, my lord.
This one will do nicely.
Olyvar:
Oh, I'm not a lady.
A term of courtesy
in this establishment.
A lie anywhere.
Why not use
the right words?
I'm a bastard.
She is a whore.
And you're what?
A procurer.
Any of the others?
The two girls can leave.
-
- You stay.
I'm afraid I'm not
an offer, my lord.
Everyone who works
for Littlefinger is an offer.
Take off your clothes.
We'll be here a while.
- My lord.
- I am a prince, boy.
Have you ever been
with a prince?
Can't say I have.
I'm wildly expensive.
Take off your clothes.
Which way do you
like it?
-
- My way.
Man:
-
- Oberyn.
-
- Oberyn, don't.
Yes, not the rains
weep o'er his hall
And not a soul
to hear.
You lost, friend?
Forgive me for staring.
I don't see many
Lannisters where I'm from.
I don't see many
Dornishmen in the capital.
We don't like the smell.
- Come with me, lover.
- Gods, look at this one.
Sirs, if you follow me,
I'll arrange for a private room.
Why are you wasting a woman
like this on a Dornishman?
Bring him a shaved goat
and a bottle of olive oil.
Do you know why all the world
hates a Lannister?
You think your gold
and your lions
and your gold lions
make you better than everyone.
May I tell you a secret?
You're not a golden lion.
You're just a pink
little man
who is far too slow
on the draw.
Longsword is a bad option
in close quarters.
When I pull my blade,
your friend starts bleeding.
Quite a lot, I'm afraid.
So many veins in the wrist.
He'll live if you
get him help straightaway.
So, decisions.
Prince Oberyn,
forgive the intrusion.
- We heard there might be...
-
...trouble.
Apologies, my love.
I'm here to welcome you
to the capital.
Ellaria Sand,
my paramour.
The king's own Uncle Imp.
Tyrion, son
of Tywin Lannister.
If there's anything
I can do to make your stay--
What are you?
His hired killer?
It started that way, aye.
Now I'm a knight.
How did that come to pass?
Killed the right people,
I suppose.
We'll need a few more girls.
Girls, yes?
You don't partake?
Oh, I partook.
Now I'm married.
Prince Oberyn, if I may,
a word in private?
Seems I visited
the Lannister brothel by mistake.
- Oh, they take all kinds.
- Even Dornishmen.
The king is very grateful
that you traveled all
this way for his wedding.
Let us speak truth here.
Joffrey is insulted.
I am only the second son
after all.
Well, speaking
as a fellow second son,
I have grown rather used
to being the family insult.
Why did you come
to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?
I was invited
to the royal wedding.
I thought we were
speaking truth.
The last time I was in the capital
was many years ago.
Another wedding.
My sister Elia
and Rhaegar Targaryen,
the Last Dragon.
My sister loved him.
She bore his children.
Swaddled them, rocked them,
fed them at her own breast.
Elia wouldn't let
the wet nurse touch them.
And beautiful, noble
Rhaegar Targaryen
left her
for another woman.
That started a war
and the war ended
right here
when your father's army
took the city...
I wasn't actually present.
...and butchered
those children.
My nephew and niece.
Carved them up and wrapped them
in Lannister cloaks.
And my sister, you know
what they did to her?
I'm asking you
a question.
I've heard rumors.
So have I.
The one I keep hearing
is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain
raped Elia
and split her in half
with his great sword.
I wasn't there.
I don't know what happened.
If the Mountain
killed my sister,
your father gave the order.
Tell your father
I'm here.
And tell him the Lannisters
aren't the only ones who pay their debts.
-
-
-
- Shh.
Shh. Shh.
-
-
They're dragons,
Khaleesi.
They can never be tamed.
Not even by their mother.
- Ser Barristan.
- Your Grace.
Where's Daario Naharis?
Where's Grey Worm?
Gambling, Your Grace.
Gambling?
Crowd: Mhysa. Mhysa.
Mhysa...
How long have they
been at it?
Since midnight,
Your Grace.
Ser Worm is stronger
than he looks.
But I can see his arms
beginning to shake.
What's the prize to winning
this stupid contest?
The honor of riding by your side
on the road to Meereen.
That honor goes to
Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan
as neither of them kept
me waiting this morning.
You two will ride in the rear guard
and protect the livestock.
The last man
holding his sword
can find a new queen
to fight for.
You need
to eat something.
Pigeon pie.
No, thank you.
Lemon cakes?
No, thank you.
You love lemon cakes.
Tell her
she needs to eat.
My lady, you do
need to eat.
I don't need to eat.
If I could have a moment
alone with my wife.
She needs to eat.
I can't let you starve.
My lady,
I am your husband.
Let me help you.
How can you
help me?
I don't know,
but I can try.
I lie awake all night
staring at the canopy
thinking about
how they died.
I could get you essence of nightshade
to help you sleep.
Do you know what
they did to my brother?
How they sewed his direwolf's
head onto his body?
And my mother.
They say they cut
her throat to the bone
and threw her body
in the river.
I didn't know your brother.
He seemed like a good man,
but I didn't know him.
She wanted to have
me executed,
but I admired her.
She was a strong woman.
And she was fierce
when it came
to protecting her children.
Sansa.
Your mother would want
you to carry on.
You know it's true.
Will you pardon me,
my lord?
I'd like to visit
the godswood.
Of course. Of course.
Prayer can be helpful, I hear.
I don't pray anymore.
It's the only place I can go
where people don't talk to me.
My lion.
What are you doing?
What does it look like
I'm doing? Come here.
How many times have I told you?
You can't visit me here.
I know.
I know.
We have come
to a dangerous place.
Have you forgotten me?
Do you know how long it's been?
Of course
I haven't forgotten.
I want you.
Don't you want me?
Things are a bit tense
right now.
What things?
My nephew the king
wants to murder me.
My wife hates me because my father
murdered her family.
Oberyn Martell wants
to murder everyone whose
last name is Lannister.
You need to relax.
Don't you want
to relax?
- What's wrong?
- I told you.
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.
- You have your child bride now.
- Shae.
- Do you love her?
- Love her?
I barely know her.
She's a child.
- She despises me.
- That's not an answer.
Of course
I don't love her.
You tried
to ship me away.
Ship you away?
Give me diamonds
and make me disappear.
What in the world
are you talking about?
If you want me to leave,
just say it.
- Say it!
- Shh.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You want me to stay?
A work of art, really.
The craftsmanship
is excellent.
You like it so much,
you're welcome to chop off
your own hand and take it.
Such an ingrate.
I spent days with the goldsmith
- getting the details just right.
- Days?
Better part
of an afternoon.
There, how does
that feel?
Uh...
a hook would be
more practical.
Elegant, I think.
Thank you for your help
with the other matter.
- The symptoms have abated?
- Gone completely.
I am in your debt,
Maester Qyburn.
Not a maester, Your Grace,
but happy to help
whenever I can.
Odd little man.
- I've grown rather fond of him.
-
He's quite talented,
you know?
What symptoms?
Symptoms that are
not your concern.
You let him
touch you?
You jealous?
I'm surprised.
You never let
Pycelle near you.
You think I'd let
that old lecher
put his hands on me?
He smells like a dead cat.
Well, they smell
like Pycelle.
You drink more
than you used to.
- Yes.
- Why?
Let's see, you started
a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark
and disappeared
from the capital.
My husband died in a tragic
hunting accident.
It must have been
traumatic for you.
My only daughter
was shipped off to Dorne.
A rather short siege.
A rather short siege
that I didn't expect to survive.
And now I'm marrying
my eldest son
to a wicked little
bitch from Highgarden
while I'm supposed
to marry her brother,
a renowned pillow biter.
So...
Father disowned me today.
He can't disown you.
You're all he's got.
You're forgetting Tyrion.
You don't really plan on staying in
the Kingsguard, do you?
Staying in the Kingsguard
means I live right here
in the Red Keep
with you.
- Not now.
- I want--
Not now? When?
I've been back for weeks.
- Something's changed.
- Everything's changed.
You come back after all this time
with no apologies
and one hand and expect
everything to be the same?
What do you want me
to apologize for?
For leaving me.
You think I wanted
to be taken prisoner?
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.
You left me alone.
Every day I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape.
Every day. I murdered people
so I could be here with you.
- You took too long.
- I...
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you took too long.
- Come in.
- Jaime:
Forgive me, Your Grace.
You told me to come
at once if there was anything important.
You plan on killing
all the crows yourself?
Do you plan on sitting
here scratching your balls till winter?
We wait for Mance's orders.
You sent a man over the Wall
at the full moon.
March on Castle Black
with just this lot?
Your pretty crow
said 1,000 men are nesting there.
Yeah, well,
he's a liar.
He is?
Shouldn't it be
"he was"?
You said you put
three arrows in him.
I did.
I've seen you slip a shaft
through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.
If that boy's still walking,
it's 'cause you let him go.
Thenns.
I fucking hate Thenns.
Mance sent you?
-
- How did you find us?
You came from the south,
not the north.
Took a detour.
Got some supper from
a village down that way.
than it does
on our side of the Wall?
Help yourself.
Maybe everything's
just better fed down here.
Fat and lazy.
Easier for us, hmm?
You didn't see
us coming?
Lost your warg?
And that baby crow
you had with you,
lost him too?
I'll answer to Mance.
I won't answer to you.
She yours?
I'm not anybody's.
Too scrawny.
Not like those crows
at Castle Black.
stuffing their faces
with ham and blood sausage
and stew, getting
nice and fat
and marbled.
I know we've had
our differences, Tormund,
but just one time
before you die,
you really ought
to try crow.
Officer:
Loose.
Jon:
I was jealous of Robb
my whole life.
He was better than me
at everything--
fighting and hunting
and riding
and girls.
I wanted to hate him,
but I never could.
Sometimes I want
to hate you.
Well, you're better
than me at everything.
Except reading.
They're--
they're ready for you.
He's wanted to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.
No one's going
to hang you.
You've done
nothing wrong.
I've done plenty wrong.
So you admit you
murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
Jon:
No?
You put your sword
through a brother
of the Night's Watch.
What do you call that?
He wanted me
to kill him.
A bastard son
of a traitor.
What would
you expect?
The Halfhand believed
our only chance
to stop Mance was to get
a man inside his army.
Don't talk about the Halfhand
as if you knew him.
He was my brother.
Then you'd know he'd do anything
to defend the Wall.
The free folk would have boiled him alive,
but letting me kill him...
Slynt:
He even talks like
a wildling now.
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.
I climbed the Wall
with the wildlings. I--
I laid with
a wildling girl.
You admit to breaking
your vows, then?
I do.
The law is the law.
The boy must die.
If we beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,
the Wall would be manned
by headless men.
There's a difference
between sneaking off
to the Mole's Town brothel
and sleeping with the enemy.
While we sit here
debating which rules
I broke,
Mance Rayder marches on the Wall
with an army of 100,000.
Impossible.
You can't get
before they start
killing each other.
He's united the Thenns,
He has giants
fighting for him.
Giants?
Have you ever been
beyond the Wall, ser?
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.
And now you're here.
You must not have been
very good at your job.
How dare you?!
There's a band of wildlings
south of the Wall already
led by Tormund Giantsbane.
I killed their warg
and three others.
They shot me
full of arrows.
Their orders are to attack
Castle Black from the south
when Mance hits
it from the north.
The signal for the attack
will be a bonfire.
Mance said it would be
the greatest fire
the North has ever seen.
All the truth.
Do you intend to execute me
or am I free to go?
None of us are free.
We are men
of the Night's Watch.
But we won't be taking
your head today, Jon Snow.
Go on.
I am acting commander here,
Maester Aemon.
Yes, you are.
And I don't trust
the bastard.
He told the truth.
And you always know
when a man's telling a lie?
How did you acquire
this magical power?
I grew up
in King's Landing.
Olenna:
You're a queen,
not an ox.
Your grandfather
gave me a necklace
just like this one
for my 51st nameday.
The wedding is in
a fortnight, Grandmother.
You can't say no
to everything.
Nonsense.
My little dears.
Go and speak to the jewelers
of King's Landing.
Tell them who you are,
tell them who sent you.
The one who brings
me the best necklace
will get to keep
the next best.
The Margaery Tyrell
who walks into the sept
a fortnight from now
will inspire 1,000 songs.
Now, how sad it will be if
she's wearing rubbish like that.
Perhaps I should just let
Joffrey choose it for me.
End up with a string
of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
You watch that.
Even here, even with me.
My word.
My lady.
My lady.
Please pardon me
for interrupting.
My name is Brienne
of Tarth.
We know who you are.
We've heard all about you.
But hearing is one thing.
Aren't you just marvelous?
Absolutely singular.
I hear you knocked
my grandson into the dirt
like the silly little
boy he is.
My lady, I know this is
a very busy time for you,
but if I could
just have a moment.
You dare not refuse.
A shadow?
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.
I swear to you by all
the gods it was Stannis.
He plunged his sword
through Renly's heart
and disappeared.
One day, my lady,
I will avenge our king.
Joffrey is our king now.
I meant no offense.
And you've given none.
All the Kingsguard
will be on duty, of course.
Ser Boros
will be stationed here.
Ser Preston
will be stationed here
beside the primary
entertainment.
Your Grace?
Yes, yes,
one guard at the--
the thing.
Go on.
Ser Meryn will guard
Lady Margaery and Tommen.
I've always guarded
the king himself, my lord.
Ever since your absence.
And I thank you
for it, Ser Meryn.
All very good.
I don't expect any trouble.
The people love
their king.
They know who
keeps them fed.
Margaery Tyrell,
I've heard.
By my leave.
They know I saved the city.
They know I won the war.
The war's not won.
Not while Stannis lives.
I broke Stannis
on the Blackwater.
Pity you weren't
there to help, Uncle.
My apologies, Your Grace.
I was rather busy.
Busy getting captured.
So this is the famous
"Book of Brothers"?
All the great deeds
of all the great Kingsguard.
Ser Arthur Dayne.
The Sword of the Morning.
Led the attack
on the Kingswood Brotherhood.
Defeated the Smiling Knight
in single combat.
Ser Duncan the Tall.
Four pages
for Ser Duncan.
He must have been
quite a man.
So they say.
Ser Jaime Lannister.
Someone forgot to write down
all your great deeds.
- There's still time.
- Is there?
For a 40-year-old knight
with one hand?
How can you protect me
with that?
I use my left hand
now, Your Grace.
Makes for more
of a contest.
Daenerys: Have you ever been
to Meereen?
Several times, Your Grace,
with Master Kraznys.
And?
They say
building the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.
And now an army
of former slaves
is marching
to her gates.
You think the Great
Masters are worried?
If they're smart,
Your Grace.
You were told to ride
at the back of the train.
Yes, my queen.
But I need to speak to you
about something important.
A matter of strategy.
Your Grace.
All right, what is this
matter of strategy?
A dusk rose.
Would you like to walk at the back
of the train instead of riding?
And this one's called
lady's lace.
Would you like
to walk without shoes?
You have to know
a land to rule it.
Its plants,
its rivers,
its roads,
its people.
Dusk rose tea
eases fever.
Everyone in Meereen
knows that.
Especially the slaves
who have to make the tea.
If you want them
to follow you,
you have to become
a part of their world.
Strategy.
Harpy's Gold.
No tea from this one.
Beautiful but poisonous.
You are a gambler,
aren't you?
Your Grace.
There's one on every mile marker
between here and Meereen.
How many miles are there between
here and Meereen?
Barristan:
You don't need
to see this.
You will do
no such thing.
I will see each
and every one of their faces.
Remove her collar
before you bury her.
Brienne:
Jaime:
Yes, there she is.
- And?
- You made a promise.
To return the Stark girls
to their mother who is now dead.
To keep them safe.
Well, Arya Stark
hasn't been seen
since her father
was killed.
Where do you think she is?
My money's on dead.
There's a certain safety
in death, wouldn't you say?
And Sansa Stark is now
Sansa Lannister.
Bit of a complication.
A complication does not
release you from a vow.
What do you want me to do?
Kidnap my sister-in-law?
And take her where?
Where would she be safer than here?
Look me in the eye
and tell me
that you think she'll be
safe in King's Landing.
Are you sure
we're not related?
Ever since I've returned,
every Lannister I've seen
has been a miserable
pain in my ass.
Maybe you're
a Lannister, too.
You've got the hair for it
if not the looks.
-
- It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
- You're drunk.
- Yes.
I have good reason to be.
Once I was a knight.
Now I'm only a fool.
Don't you know me?
Ser Dontos.
The king's nameday celebration.
I'm sorry.
I should have remembered.
I can't accept your apology.
I may be a fool,
but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.
Anyone would have
done the same.
But only you did.
I can never repay you.
You gave me my life.
But this,
this is worth
more than my life.
It belonged to my mother
and her mother before her.
House Hollard
was strong once.
House on the rise.
That's all that's left
of those days,
thanks to a few sad,
fat drunks like me.
I can't take it.
It's very, very kind of you,
but I can't.
I don't have
anything else left.
That's all.
Take it.
Wear it.
Let my name have
one more moment in the sun
before it disappears
from the world.
I'll wear it with pride,
Ser Dontos.
Yeah.
Arya:
The little lady
wants a pony.
The little lady wants
away from your stench.
Horses aren't easy
to come by.
Even if they were,
you think I'm gonna put
you on your own horse?
Watch the only thing of value
I've got in the world ride away?
Why don't you
have any money?
Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey
before you left?
No.
You're not very smart,
are you?
I'm not a thief.
You're fine with
murdering little boys,
but thieving
is beneath you?
A man's got
to have a code.
You think
I'm gonna escape?
Where would I go?
I'd be dead by nightfall
without you.
My family's gone.
I've got no one.
You've got an aunt
in the Vale.
Your rich Aunt Lysa.
After I sell you to her,
maybe she'll have
enough left over
to buy you that pony
you want so much.
Arya:
Five horses,
five men.
More than I feel like
killing on an empty stomach.
I know him.
He captured us
and took us to Harrenhal.
He killed Lommy.
What the fuck's a Lommy?
He was my friend.
Polliver stole my sword
and put it right through his neck.
He's still got it.
Hound:
My sword Needle.
Needle?
Of course you named your sword.
Lots of people
name their swords.
Lots of cunts.
What are you--
get back here.
My brother gave me
that sword.
- Get back here.
- He killed my friend.
I don't care
if he ate your friend.
We're not going in there.
-
- Man:
- Come here.
-
- Let's have a feel there.
- Leave it.
-
- Come here.
Please,
she's a good girl.
Shut your mouth
and pour us more ale
and we may not take
her with us when we're done with her.
I know you.
You're the Hound.
What brings you
so far north?
I could ask
the same of you.
What are you
doing up here?
Just keeping
the king's peace.
No need.
The war's over.
So I've heard.
Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.
Robb Stark killed
at the Twins.
And where am I
for all of it?
Stuck with your brother.
- Meaning no offense.
- None taken.
He's good,
the Mountain is.
Best at what he does.
But torture, torture,
torture, torture.
Drains the fun
right out of it.
And what's life
without a little fun?
But I don't need
to tell you that, eh?
She's all right.
I've had better.
You know what?
You should come
with us.
His kind, they've always got
something hidden away somewhere.
Gold, silver,
more daughters.
And there's plenty of him
between here and King's Landing.
You could do well
for yourself.
We certainly have been.
I'm not going
to King's Landing.
Think about it.
We could do whatever we like
wherever we go.
These are
the king's colors.
No one's standing
in his way now.
Which means no one's
standing in ours.
Fuck the king.
When I heard that Joffrey's
dog had tucked tail
and run from the Battle
of the Blackwater,
I didn't believe it.
- But here you are.
- Here I am.
Bring me one
of those chickens.
- You got money to pay for it?
- You paid for it?
No.
But we're
the king's men.
So, you got money?
Not a penny.
I'll still
take that chicken.
Tell you what.
We'll trade you.
One of our little chickens
for one of yours.
Lowell there likes them
a bit broken in.
You're a talker.
Listening to talkers
makes me thirsty.
Ah.
And hungry.
Think I'll take
two chickens.
You don't seem to
understand the situation.
I understand that
if any more words
come pouring out
of your cunt mouth,
I'm gonna have to eat
every fucking chicken in this room.
You lived your life
for the king.
You're gonna die
for some chickens?
Someone is.
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?
What?
What do you mean?
Can you walk?
I've got to carry you?
Carry me?
Fine little blade.
Maybe I'll pick
my teeth with it.
