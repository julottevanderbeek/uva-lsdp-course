NICK: In my younger and
more vulnerable years...
"Always try to see the best
in people," he would say.
As a consequence, I'm inclined
to reserve all judgments.
Back then, all of
us drank too much.
The more in tune with
the times we were...
And none of us contributed
anything new.
When I came back from New
York, I was disgusted.
DOCTOR: I see, Mr. Carraway.
NICK: Disgusted with
everyone and everything.
Only one man was exempt
from my disgust.
One man?
Mr. Carraway?
Gatsby.
DOCTOR: Was he a
friend of yours?
He was...
The single most hopeful
person I've ever met.
And am ever likely
to meet again.
There was something...
About him, a sensitivity.
He was like...
He was like one of those machines that
register earthquakes 10,000 Miles away.
Where'd you meet him?
NICK: At a... at a party...
In New York.
The tempo of the
city approached...
Record peaks...
The morals were
looser and the ban...
Wall street was luring
the young and ambitious.
I rented a house 20 Miles
from the city on long island.
In a forgotten grounds keeper's
cottage, squeezed among the mansions...
To get started, I bought a dozen volumes
on credit, banking and investments.
Man
The stock market...
Hit another high. CLERK: The
market's moving up, up, up!
Well, of course, nothing is 100 percent.
I wouldn't go investing every Penny.
NICK: At Yale I dreamed
of being a writer...
And the bursts of
leaves on the trees...
For the riotous...
From beyond...
Not yet met...
He was your neighbor.
My neighbor.
Yeah.
When I think about it, the history
of the summer really began...
The night I drove over to my
cousin Daisy's for dinner.
She lived across the
bay in old moneyed...
Her husband was heir to one of
America's wealthiest families.
Was Tom...
A sporting star. But now his Glory
days were behind him and he...
- contented himself with...
- Telephone, monsieur Buchanan.
MYRTLE: It's me.
NICK: Other affairs.
I thought I told you
not to call me here.
Boaz!
Shakespeare!
- Tom! Oh!
- Ha-ha-ha!
How's the great
American novel coming?
I'm selling bonds with
Walter chase's outfit.
Let's say after dinner, you
and I, we go into town.
- I can't. - Catch up
with the old wolf pack.
- Big day on the job tomorrow.
- Nonsense! We're going.
First team, all-American.
You see?
Made me who I am today.
Forest hills.
Played the Prince of wales.
What a sissy.
Life is...
Something you dominate.
If you're any good.
Oh!
Oh.
DAISY: Hey.
TOM: Henri!
Where are you?
The doors.
Close them.
Sorry. Thank you.
DAISY: Is that you, my lovely?
NICK: Daisy Buchanan,
the Golden girl.
A promise that there
was no one else...
Do they miss me in Chicago?
Yes. Um, at least a dozen
people send their love.
How gorgeous.
They're absolutely in mourning.
- They're crying.
Yes. DAISY: No.
- I don't believe you.
NICK: Wailing.
DAISY: I don't believe you.
- They're screaming.
"Daisy Buchanan..."
We can't live...
- "...without you!"
- I'm paralyzed with happiness.
NICK: Whoa!
Whoa! Oh!
Jordan Baker...
A very...
Famous golfer.
Oh.
NICK: She was the most frightening
person I'd ever seen.
Well, I've seen your face on
the cover of sporting life.
Nick Carraway.
JORDAN: I've been
lying on that sofa...
For as long as I can remember.
This summer I'll fling you two together.
I'll push you into linen closets...
And out to sea in boats!
- I'm not listening to a word.
- So, Nick...
Daisy tells me...
That you're over in west egg...
Throwing your lot in...
With those social-climbing...
Primitive new-money types.
My little shack's just a
cardboard box at 80 a month.
Your life is adorable.
JORDAN: I know
somebody in west egg.
I don't know a single person...
That side of the bay.
You must know Gatsby.
Gatsby?
What Gatsby?
Madame, the dinner is servi.
DAISY: Would you
like to hear...
- That's why I came over. DAISY:
It's about the Butler's nose.
Things went from bad to worse.
TOM: I hate that
word "hulking."
I heard a rumor that you
were getting married...
To a girl out west.
NICK: It's a libel.
- I'm too poor. JORDAN:
They have to be old...
So they die quickly.
NICK: Can't we talk
about something else?
Anything. Crops.
You're making me
feel uncivilized...
Daisy.
TOM: Civilization's
going to pieces.
Have you read the rise of
the colored empires...
By this fellow Goddard?
Everybody ought to...
Read it. The idea is...
That it's up to us,
the dominant race...
To watch out or these...
Other races...
Will have control of things.
Tom's very profound lately. He reads
deep books with long words in them.
TOM: It's been proved.
It's scientific.
We've got to beat them down.
HENRI: Buchanan residence.
Monsieur Wilson,
from the garage.
Monsieur Buchanan.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
I'm sorry.
- Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke
of... TOM: I'm working on it.
NICK: He's my neighbor.
- Shh! Don't talk.
I wanna hear what happens.
DAISY: I don't care
what you do...
Something happening?
- Why, I thought everybody
knew. - Well, I don't.
JORDAN: Tom's got some...
Woman in New York.
NICK: Got some woman?
She might have the decency not to
telephone at dinnertime. Don't you think?
DAISY: Is that too much to ask?
TOM: Daisy, don't create a scene.
I love seeing you at my table.
You remind me of a Rose.
An absolute Rose...
Doesn't he? TOM:
So after dinner...
I'm not like a Rose.
TOM: Nick wanted
to go into town.
To the Yale club.
Nicky, stay.
I have to work early.
Nonsense.
DAISY: There's so much to
talk about. TOM: It's just...
For a drink or two.
NICK: None of us...
Could ignore that fifth
guest's shrill...
DAISY: Nicky. NICK: What?
It's just, well, you see, I think
everything's terrible anyhow.
- Really?
- Yes.
I've been everywhere and seen
everything and done everything.
I've had a very bad time, Nicky.
I'm pretty cynical
about everything.
Your daughter, I suppose she...
Talks and eats and everything?
DAISY: Pammy?
Oh, yes.
Listen, Nick, when
she was born...
Tom was God knows where...
With God knows whom.
And I asked...
The nurse if it was
a boy or a girl.
And she said it was a girl...
And I wept.
"I'm glad it's a girl."
And I hope she'll be a fool.
That's the best thing a
girl in this world can be.
"A beautiful little fool."
All the bright, precious
things fade so fast.
And they don't come back.
Had emerged on my
neighbor's dock.
And something
told me it was...
He seemed to be
reaching toward...
Something out there
in the dark.
The green light.
I don't wanna talk
about this, doctor.
Then write about it.
- Write about it?
- Yes.
Why would I do that?
DOCTOR: You said
yourself writing...
Brought you solace.
Yeah, well, it didn't bring
anyone else much solace.
I wasn't any good.
No one need ever read it.
You could always burn it.
What would I write about?
Anything
whatever brings you ease.
A memory...
A thought, a place.
Write it down.
A place.
The valley of ashes was
a grotesque place.
New York's dumping ground halfway
between west egg and the city...
Where the burnt-out
coal that powered...
Crumbling through
the powdery air.
Was ever watched by Dr. T.J.
Eckleburg...
A forgotten oculist whose
eyes brooded over it all...
Of God.
Tom had invited me to town, apparently
for lunch at the Yale club...
But...
Turn.
Come on.
- Come on!
- What do you mean?
Trust me!
NICK: What are we doing?
CONDUCTOR: Where are you going?
Jump!
- What are you doing?
TOM: Jump, come on!
- Tom! TOM: Come on!
NICK: Oh, God.
Tom, wait. Wait a
second, would you?
TOM: Dominate, Nick!
Dominate!
Hello, Wilson.
How's business?
Yeah, I can't complain.
Uh...
So when are you gonna...
- sell me that car? - Oh, I've
still got my man working on it.
Yeah, well, he works
pretty slow, don't he?
Maybe I'd better sell
it somewhere else.
WILSON: Oh, no, no, no.
I wasn't saying that. I was.
MYRTLE: If it's business,
you should be talking...
To me.
Get some chairs...
Why don't you, so
somebody can sit down.
WILSON: Uh, sure.
Yeah, let's talk business.
Sure.
I'll get the chairs.
Myrtle...
Why don't you entertain?
MYRTLE: Hurry up.
- Hi.
- Hi.
WILSON: Mr. Buchanan.
Candy?
- No, thank you. WILSON: No?
TOM: Mrs. Wilson,
Nick Carraway.
Oh.
A pleasure.
Nick's a writer.
Oh.
I'm in bonds actually.
I want you...
Get on the next train.
MYRTLE: Now?
Yes.
Can we get the dog?
- For the apartment?
- Whatever you want.
Hey, Mr. Buchanan!
You want a soda?
- I'm fine. WILSON: No?
Call your sister.
She'll like him.
No, no, no. That's all
right, thank you.
Catherine's said to be very
good-looking by people who know.
Oh, really, I can't.
Hey
you wanna embarrass Myrtle?
That's rude.
I'm Catherine.
Ain't we having a party?
Um, I'm not sure...
Now's a good time.
I'm just going. Actually,
there are peop
hello!
Oh, Chester, this
must be the cousin.
- Oh, you are adorable.
- Oh, thank you.
Chester McKee.
Pleasure to meet you.
NICK: Nick Carraway.
CATHERINE: Come on...
- don't you like me?
- Oh. Heh. A plant.
Myrtle!
Myrtle!
Myrtle turtle!
I really must go.
Get everybody a drink
before they fall asleep.
Torn, I'm just leaving now.
Nick.
Wait.
- I'm going. I've gotta get
out of here. - Nonsense!
Go on in there and
talk to Catherine.
I'm not comfortable.
Daisy's my cousin.
Listen, I know you like to watch.
I remember that from college.
No, no, no, I don't
make any judgment.
We have all summer.
Now, do you wanna sit on the sideline
and watch, or do you wanna play ball?
Play ball.
- Ain't we good enough for you?
MYRTLE: Come on!
Come on! Come on.
He's gonna sit on the
side and watch, huh?
Or is he gonna play ball?
Take off your hat
and stay a while.
TOM: Oh, hey, Nick. McKee...
- is in the artistic game.
- Photography.
TOM: Nick's artistic. - No.
- No, no, no.
- Really?
- I write a little, but...
CATHERINE: Really?
Do you live on long island too?
- I live at west egg. - I
was there at a party...
About a month ago. A man named
Gatsbys. Do you know him?
I live right next door to him.
He's a cousin of
kaiser Wilhelm's.
- You know, the evil
German King? - Really?
TOM: Hey, McKee!
- Take a picture of that.
MYRTLE: Ah!
Don't, I'm not one
of those models.
You can if you want.
Neither of them can stand the
person they're married to.
Doesn't she like Wilson either?
MYRTLE: He's a greasy...
Little scumbag.
No, thanks, I feel just as
good on nothing at all.
Nerve pills.
I get them from a
doctor in queens.
Do you want one?
Oh, no. My nerves
are fine, thanks.
NICK: I had been drunk
just twice in my life.
And the second time
was that afternoon.
Flat that torn
kept for Myrtle...
This is better than
the Yale club.
Windows must have
contributed their share...
Too...
And without.
By the inexhaustible
variety of life.
TOM: You have got no right...
To speak her name.
Daisy, Daisy, Daisy!
- You got no right to speak her name!
- I'll speak her name whenever-
- oh, my God, you are crazy!
TOM: You whore!
MYRTLE: They're
gonna arrest you!
I have no clue how
I got home...
DOCTOR: Watching you?
Yes.
And how did you know that?
I got an invitation.
The only one.
By which I mean no
one except me...
Ever received an actual
invitation to Gatsby's.
You see, the rest
of New York...
The whole city packed
into automobiles.
And all weekend,
every weekend...
MAN: Yeah!
Carnival...
through Gatsby's door.
MAN: Out of the way!
My invitation. Oh.
Sir, my invitation.
This way!
Hey!
Of billionaire playboy publishers
and their blond nurses.
Heiresses comparing
inheritances on Gatsby's beach.
My boss, Walter chase, losing
money at the roulette tables.
Gangsters and governors
exchanging telephone numbers.
And ewing klipspringer, dubious
descendent of Beethoven.
Do you know where I might find the
host, Mr. Gatsby? I live next door.
BARTENDER: Gatsby?
I've never seen Mr. Gatsby.
Why, no one has.
Wow.
JORDAN: I thought I
might see you here.
- Hello.
- I remembered...
You live next door.
It's like an amusement park.
Shall we?
NICK: Did you get an
invitation? - People aren't...
Invited to Gatsby's.
Well, I was.
Seems I'm the only one.
Who is this Gatsby?
- He was a German spy during the
war. JORDAN: Teddy Barton...
Nick Carraway.
NICK: A German spy?
No, no, no. He's the
kaiser's assassin.
I heard he killed a man once.
MAN 1: True. MAN 2: Kills
for fun, free of charge.
He's certainly richer than God.
You don't really believe
he killed a man, do you?
Let's go find him and you
can ask him yourself.
TRIMALCHIO: Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage...
The incredible...
Miss Gilda gray!
The Charleston!
Either you're mine
or you're not.
Mr. Gatsby?
Come on.
JORDAN: But you are mistaken!
For I am...
The mysterious...
Mr. Gatsby.
OWL EYES: You won't find him.
This house...
And everything in it...
Are all part...
Of an elaborate disguise.
But Mr. Gatsby doesn't exist.
Phooey. I've met him.
Really? Which one?
The Prince?
The spy?
The murderer?
I cannot find anyone...
Who knows anything real about...
Mr. Gatsby.
Well, I don't care.
He gives large parties...
And I like large parties.
They're so intimate.
Small parties, there
isn't any privacy.
But if that's true...
What's all this for?
OWL EYES: That,
my dear fellow...
Is the question.
Right here, right
now is all we got.
NICK: May I have this dance?
TEDDY: You penniless
pantywaist.
Oh, yeah.
TEDDY: I'm stealing...
Her away.
TRIMALCHIO: Ladies and
gentlemen... TEDDY: Come on.
A jazz history of the world...
And accompanying...
Fireworks!
JORDAN: Come on. Nick.
TEDDY: Look around you.
Rich girls don't
marry poor boys.
She's mine.
MAN: Your face is familiar.
Weren't you in the third
division during the war?
NICK: Oh, yes, the 9th battalion.
MAN: I was in the 7th.
MAN: I knew you looked familiar.
Having a good time, 'Old Sport'?
NICK: The whole
thing's incredible.
I live just next door.
He sent me an actual invitation.
Seems I'm the only one.
I still haven't met Mr. Gatsby.
No one's met him.
They say he's third cousin to the
kaiser and second cousin to the devil.
MAN: I'm afraid I haven't
been a very good host...
'Old Sport'.
You see...
I'm Gatsby.
You're...
NICK: His smile was
one of those...
Rare smiles that you
may come across...
You and believe in you just as you
would like to be understood...
Sorry, 'Old Sport'.
I thought you knew.
Please just-I don't
know what to say.
- Please forgive me. I've
had... - It's quite all right.
- So much to drink.
- Yes?
Mr. Gatsby, Sir.
Chicago on the wire.
I'll be in in just a minute.
I'm taking my new hydroplane
out in the morning.
Would you like to go with me?
What time?
The time that suits you.
Well, that's very kind of you.
Lovely to see you
again, miss Baker.
If there's...
Anything that you want...
Just ask for it, 'Old Sport'.
Excuse me. I will...
Rejoin you later.
I expected him to be...
JORDAN: Old and fat?
NICK: Yes.
Young men don't just drift
coolly out of nowhere...
And buy a palace on long island.
JORDAN: He told me once...
He was an Oxford man.
However, I don't believe it.
Why not?
JORDAN: I don't know. I just
don't believe he went there.
HERZOG: I beg your pardon.
Miss Baker, Mr. Gatsby would
like to speak to you.
Alone.
Me?
HERZOG: Yes, madam.
JORDAN: Nick!
Nick!
Nick!
I've just heard the
most shocking thing.
Where have you been?
The car's waiting.
JORDAN: Simply amazing.
It all makes sense.
It all makes sense.
Come on.
- What makes sense?
JORDAN: Everything!
Come on, this is crazy!
We gotta...
Get out of here. JORDAN:
Here I am tantalizing you...
When I swore I wouldn't tell.
Just tell me.
Oh, Nick, I'm sorry, I swore.
I swore I wouldn't tell.
Sorry to keep her from
you, 'Old Sport'.
- Ah.
- Don't forget...
We're going up in that
hydroplane tomorrow.
Yes.
Mr. Gatsby, Sir...
- Philadelphia on the phone.
- Yes.
Night, 'Old Sport'.
Good night.
Thank you.
OWL EYES: What's the matter?
You run out of gas?
Nick! Come and see me!
We'll have tea next week.
I'm in the phone book.
I'll call you up.
NICK: Well, we rode
in the hydroplane.
But you know, doctor,
I realized...
That I knew absolutely
nothing about Gatsby at all.
It's pretty, isn't it, 'Old Sport'?
Haven't you ever seen it before?
It's all a custom job.
Supercharged engine.
Get dressed.
We're going to lunch.
- Oh, well.
- Yeah.
GATSBY: Look here,
'Old Sport'.
What is your opinion
of me, anyhow?
'Yes! '
yes, your opinion.
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression...
From all these bizarre
accusations you must be hearing.
A pack of lies, I guarantee.
You've heard the stories?
Oh.
I will tell you God's truth.
God's truth about myself.
I am the son of very wealthy
people from the middle west.
Sadly, all of them are dead.
I was brought up in America...
But educated at Oxford...
Because all my ancestors...
Have been educated there for
years. It's a family tradition.
No wonder people
thought he was lying.
After my family died, I ran
into a great deal of money.
After that, I lived
like a Prince...
In all the capitals of Europe.
NICK: Oh, Europe.
GATSBY: Yes, Europe.
Paris, Venice...
Rome, vienna...
Zurich, helsinki...
Moscow, Istanbul...
Collecting jewels...
Chiefly rubies...
Hunting big game...
Painting a little,
things for myself only.
Trying to forget
something sad...
It couldn't be any
more fantastical...
- Then came the war, 'Old
Sport'. - He became...
A war hero, single-handedly
defeating the German army.
In the argonne Forest, I took two
machine gun detachments so far...
We were outnumbered 5 to 1.
There was a half a mile gap...
There wasn't a single German
soldier left standing.
We stayed there two
days and two nights.
Saw were piles of dead.
One hundred and thirty men
with only 16 Lewis guns.
Every allied government
gave me a medal.
Even Montenegro.
Here.
That's from Montenegro.
NICK: "Major Jay Gatsby for...
- "...valor extraordinary." - Valor
extraordinary. That's right.
And this is something I always carry
with me, a souvenir of Oxford days.
That was taken in Trinity quad.
The man on my left...
Is now the Earl of Don-Caster.
NICK: What could I say?
The photograph was
undoubtedly authentic.
GATSBY: Of course, you don't need to
take my word for it, 'Old Sport'.
At lunch, I'm going to
introduce you to one of...
New York's most distinguished
businessmen...
A Mr. Meyer Wolfshiem,
my good friend.
He will confirm all
I have told you...
- and vouch for my good character.
- That's not necessary.
GATSBY: Oh, but it is, though.
I thought you ought
to know something...
About my life. I didn't
want you to think I was...
Well...
I didn't want you to
think I was some nobody.
You see, 'Old Sport', I'm going to
make a very big request of you today.
A big request?
Yes.
Miss Baker will
explain everything...
When you take her to tea.
NICK: Jordan? What's
she got to do with it?
GATSBY: Well, I assure you...
It's nothing underhand.
Miss Baker's an honest
sportswoman. She wouldn't do...
Anything that wasn't all right.
Pull over!
- Pull over to the curb! - All
right, 'Old Sport'. All right.
Right you are!
I'll know you next time...
Mr. Gatsby!
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.
One of your old Oxford pals?
Well, I was able to do the
commissioner a favor once.
He sends me a Christmas
card every year.
I imagine he'll be at lunch too.
Heh.
We reached the bridge, I
was impossibly confused.
But the city seen from
the queensboro bridge...
Is always the city seen
for the first time...
In it's first wild promise
of all the mystery...
Can happen now that
we've slid over...
MAN: Yes, absolutely.
Oh!
Ah!
My boy!
GATSBY: Meyer, Meyer, Meyer.
Mm. Smell so good.
- Look at you!
GATSBY: Look at you.
Mr. Carraway, this is my good
friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfshiem.
A wonderful pleasure...
- Mr. Carraway.
- My pleasure.
I know all about you.
- I see. WOLFSHIEM: Yes!
Mr. Gatsby's...
Always talking about you.
NICK: Really?
Shall we?
WOLFSHIEM: Come.
Join us for a little...
"Lunch."
Hundred, hundred, hundred dollar bills.
Yeah!
- Hands off! OFFICER: Out!
Out you go!
MAN 1: Get off me!
Tell Walter chase he
keeps his mouth shut...
Or he doesn't get a Penny.
GATSBY: We'll talk about...
That later. HEAD WAITER:
Highballs, Mr. Gatsby?
Highballs it is.
HEAD WAITER: All right. - You
take care of my friend.
Look who's here.
GATSBY: You see these fists?
He's the next heavyweight...
- champion. - Pay my
respects to your boss.
Hey, Jay!
You're under arrest! Ha-ha-ha!
You be careful, now. You're turning
into a real jazz hound, commissioner.
Bang, bang!
- That's the commissioner.
WAITER 1: Mr. Gatsby...
Your table is ready.
MAN 2: Gatsby!
- Good to see you.
WOLFSHIEM: Yeah,
that's fantastic.
You be careful at
those tables now...
Senator.
I'll put a bet on for you, Jay!
We'll have the lobster.
It's decorated with
truffles and fine herbs.
WOLFSHIEM: So...
How is the bond
business, Mr. Carraway?
Fine. Thank you.
I understand you're
looking for...
- a business connection.
- No. No, no, no.
No, no, no.
This isn't the man, Meyer.
This is the friend...
That I told you about.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I had a wrong man.
GATSBY: If you'll excuse
me, I have to make...
That call.
Any luck, senator?
WOLFSHIEM: What a gentleman.
From one of the finest
families in the midwest.
Sadly, all dead now.
When I first made
the pleasure of...
Mr. Gatsby's acquaintance
just after the war...
I knew I'd discovered a
man of fine breeding.
A war hero.
Such medals.
And...
And...
An Oxford man.
You know Oxford?
Yes, I've heard of it.
WOLFSHIEM: Then you'd know that
when it comes to married women...
A man like this can be trusted.
With a friend...
With someone like you...
He'd never so much as
look at your wife.
I'm not married.
But you work on
wall street, right?
Yes.
Ah.
Looking at my tiepin?
Finest specimen of human...
Molar.
GATSBY: Gentlemen.
Everything all right?
Yes! Yes. We...
We were just talking about
other people's wives.
Other people's wives?
- Yes.
- Really?
WOLFSHIEM: Well, my work here is done.
I'm going to leave you gentlemen...
To talk about your
sports and your women.
Other people's wives.
WOLFSHIEM: Hello, ladies.
Ooh.
NICK: Who is he, anyhow?
An actor?
Meyer?
No, no. He's a gambler.
He's the man who fixed
the 1919 world series.
Fixed it?
Fixed it.
Well, how'd he manage that?
Saw the opportunity, I suppose.
He's a very smart man.
Now, 'Old Sport', about miss Baker
and that request we spoke of.
TOM: Nick? Nick!
NICK: Tom! Funny seeing you!
TOM: How have you been?
NICK: Yeah.
- Good. - Nick,
Daisy is furious...
- that you haven't called.
- Hey...
Mr. Gatsby, this
is Mr. Buchanan.
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.
Yeah.
Never would have expected to
find you in this Temple...
Of virtue. NICK: I
was having lunch...
With Mr. Gatsby.
MAITRED: Can I help you, Sir?
NICK: Jordan Baker...
The famous sporting star?
The golfer? I see.
I've spotted her. Thank you.
There you are.
What game are you and Gatsby...
Playing at?
- The gentleman will be
joining-? - Excuse me.
- Nick, please. NICK:
It's all rather...
Strange. He picks me
up in his fancy car.
- Going on about...
- Keep your...
his life. Voice down.
People can hear you.
What is...
This enormous request?
He wants you to
invite Daisy to tea.
Daisy?
And Gatsby.
Why?
I don't quite know
where to start.
You see, I didn't realize
until the other night that...
I'd met Gatsby.
Five years ago. In louisville.
It was the day I got my
new English golf shoes.
Was by far the most
popular girl with...
DAISY: Hello, Jordan.
The way he looked at
her is the way...
All girls want
to be looked at.
NICK: So...
Tell me what happened.
Well, I don't know.
Charge!
"Jordan". Gatsby
was sent off...
To war.
But for some unknown reason,
Gatsby couldn't return.
A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago
swept in and stole her away.
He gave her a string of
pearls worth $350,000.
But the morning
of the wedding...
Daisy received a letter.
DAISY: Tell them...
DAISY'S MOTHER: What is this?
JORDAN: Daisy, please!
- Hand it to me!
- No!
Leave me alone!
DAISY'S MOTHER: Jordan, no
one must know about this.
NICK: What was in the letter?
JORDAN: I don't know.
Married Tom Buchanan...
With more pomp and circumstance
than louisville had ever seen.
MAN: Congratulations,
Mr. Buchanan!
After the honeymoon, I saw
them in Santa Barbara.
Well, it was touching, really.
I'd never seen...
A girl so in love
with her husband.
A week later, Tom...
Crashed his car.
The girl with him was a chambermaid
at the Santa Barbara hotel.
It got into all the papers.
NICK: It's a strange
coincidence. JORDAN: What is?
NICK: The fact that Gatsby's
house is just across the bay.
It's no coincidence.
He bought that house
to be near her.
He threw all those parties hoping
she'd wander in one night.
He constantly asked about Daisy. I was
just the first person that knew her.
All that for a girl he
hasn't seen in five years.
And now he just wants me
to invite her over to tea.
The modesty of it.
JORDAN: Kind of takes
your breath...
- away, doesn't it? - Evening,
sweethearts. Where are...
You kids going?
JORDAN: Long island, please.
NICK: And you think...
I should. I mean, does
Daisy want to see Gatsby?
She's absolutely not to know.
You're supposed to
invite her over...
So he can happen to pass by.
NICK: I remember feeling torn.
Was it right to bring my cousin
Daisy, a married woman...
Together with a man
I hardly knew?
When I returned home, Gatsby's
was lit from tower to cellar...
NICK: Thank you. TAXI
DRIVER: Have a good night.
Your place looks like
the world's fair...
Or coney island.
- Does it?
- Yes.
Well, I've just been glancing...
Into some of the rooms.
What do you say we...
Go to coney island?
We could take my car.
Oh, uh, it's too late tonight.
We could take a plunge in the pool. I
haven't made use of it all summer.
I must go to bed.
All right.
Happy to do it.
I'm going to call Daisy and...
- invite her to tea.
- That's all right
- what day would suit you?
- What day would suit you?
I don't want to put
you to any trouble.
Day after tomorrow all right?
Day after tomorrow?
Well, I-I'd
see, I'd want to
get the grass cut.
Uh...
Well, look here, 'Old Sport'.
You don't make much
money, do you?
- Not really. - If
you'll forgive me...
You see, I happen to run a little
business on the side. A sort of sideline.
You understand what I'm saying,
right? You do sell bonds...
Don't you, 'Old Sport'?
- I'm trying to.
- Right.
Well, happens to be a rather...
Confidential sort of thing...
But you might make a
nice bit of money.
- No, thank you. I have my hands
full. - You wouldn't have to do...
Any business with
Wolfshiem, I assure you.
It's a favor, Jay. Just a favor.
Yes. Happy to do it.
- Favor?
- Yes.
Hm.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Good morning.
One of the papers says they thought
the rain would stop about 4.
I think it was the... I
think it was the journal.
Ah.
GATSBY: Just in to the right,
gentlemen. To the right...
In the living room. Thank you.
Is everything all right?
NICK: The grass looks fine,
if that's what you mean.
Grass?
What grass?
I bought cakes.
Have you
have you got
everything you need?
Perhaps more flowers.
I think they did a
fine job, don't you?
Beautiful.
You think it's too much?
Uh, I think it's what you want.
I think so too.
I can't...
Wait all day.
I'm leaving.
Don't be silly. It's
two minutes to 4.
No one's coming to tea! It's too
It's her!
Is this absolutely where
you live, my dearest one?
NICK: Yes, it suits me.
To come alone? Are
you in love with me?
NICK: Oh, it's the secret
of Carraway castle.
- Tell your chauffeur to go far
away. - Come back in an hour...
Ferdie.
His name is ferdie.
DAISY: Oh.
Oh. My goodness.
I can't believe it.
You... did you ransack
a greenhouse?
He is in love with me.
Would you?
That's funny.
What's funny?
Ah.
What are you doing?
I'm certainly glad
to see you again.
Hi. I'm...
I'm certainly glad
to see you, as well.
We've... we've...
We've met before.
I'll have someone
come repair this...
Immediately.
Sorry about the clock.
- That's an old clock.
- Lovely, though.
- A lovely clock.
- Yes.
We haven't met for many years.
Five years next November.
Tea?
- Yes, thank you, 'Old Sport'.
- Thank you.
NICK: Lemon or sugar?
- Neither.
Plain. Thank you.
I just have to pop...
- into town.
- Town?
I'll be right back.
Nick, I've...
Gotta speak to you.
NICK: Yes. I'll be right back.
GATSBY: God.
This was a mistake. This was a
terrible, terrible mistake.
You're just embarrassed.
Daisy's embarrassed too.
- She's embarrassed?
- Yes.
Just as much as you are.
- Don't talk so loud.
- Hey.
You're acting like a little boy.
You're being rude. Daisy's...
- in there all alone
and you're. - Shh.
NICK: Looking over
my story so far...
I'm reminded that for the
second time that summer...
I was guarding other
people's secrets.
And without.
NICK: Ahem!
It's stopped raining.
GATSBY: Yes.
It has, hasn't it?
What do you think
of that, Daisy?
Come look.
DAISY: Oh, Nicky. How funny.
Look, it's my house.
Just there across the bay.
GATSBY: I know.
I have the same
view from my place.
Where's your place?
Nick...
I want you and Daisy to come over to
my house. I'd like to show her around.
You sure you want me to come?
Absolutely, 'Old Sport'.
Absolutely.
Ladner, open the gates.
LADNER: Open the gates!
I had the gates brought in
from a castle in normandy.
Oh, Jay.
- It's so grand.
GATSBY: You like it?
I love it.
But how do you live here...
- all alone?
- Well, I don't.
I keep it always full of
interesting, celebrated people.
Come with me.
The house looks
well, doesn't it?
See the way the whole front
catches the light like that?
Oh, it's splendid.
DAISY: Come on, you two.
I want...
The Royal tour.
You must understand that I like all things
that are modern. Presses the orange...
It all comes out there.
NICK: Yay!
GATSBY: Anyone for
a round of golf?
DAISY: You do know I'm a
champion golfer? - Great!
GATSBY: Well, go on.
I thought we could...
GATSBY: Remarkable little
camera. Latest design.
DAISY: I'll show
you how it's done.
GATSBY: Nick, keep filming.
NICK: All right.
GATSBY: She's gonna take a
swing. NICK: I'm ready.
Aim. Fore!
DAISY: I'm such a brute.
NICK: You ready for your close-up?
- I don't want to forget...
A single moment. NICK:
You're shimmering.
GATSBY: She looks like she could
be on the cover of vogue.
DAISY: Turn on the camera!
NICK: Where did you go?
GATSBY: Slow down.
Slow down.
DAISY: Ahh.
It's beautiful.
GATSBY: It's a custom wurlitzer.
DAISY: Can anyone...
Play that?
Klipspringer can.
Someone wake ewing.
- Of course, Sir.
DAISY: Music!
And then we can dance...
All night. GATSBY: Ewing's
a genius, plays anything.
DAISY: Then I demand a Charleston.
- She makes it look so splendid...
Don't you think, 'Old Sport'?
GATSBY: I have a
man in england...
Who buys me clothes.
DAISY: I've never seen
anything like it.
Something for the lady.
He sends over a selection at...
The beginning of each season.
These are silk.
DAISY: Jay! GATSBY:
These are flannel.
DAISY: They're so beautiful!
GATSBY: Indian cotton.
DAISY: Stop it. Jay!
Linen.
Nicky...
He's a madman! NICK:
I can't help you!
GATSBY: Flannel!
DAISY: You're going
to have to refold...
Every single one of them.
You'll ruin them!
Jay! Stop it.
GATSBY: Right here! DAISY: No!
Jay!
What is it?
Daisy, Daisy,
darling, what is it?
It makes me sad.
Why?
NICK: Five lost years...
Why?
Because I've never seen such
beautiful shirts before.
If it wasn't for the mist...
We could see the green light.
What green light?
The one that burns all night...
At the end of your dock.
It had occurred
to Gatsby that...
The colossal significance
of that light...
And his count of enchanted
objects had diminished by one.
Who's this?
- Your father? GATSBY: Oh, no.
That's Mr. Dan
Cody, 'Old Sport'.
He's dead now.
He used to be my best
friend many years ago.
DAISY: You never told me...
You had a pompadour. Or a yacht.
I wanna show you something.
Have a seat.
These are a lot of
clippings I collected.
About you.
DAISY: You saved my letters.
This was my first...
Photo of you.
You remember...
This letter here? DAISY: We
can't lose each other...
And let all this...
I'll be here waiting
and hoping...
For every...
Long dream of you
to come true.
GATSBY: Excuse me.
MAN: Sir, Slagle's in Detroit.
- I can't talk now, 'Old Sport'.
He must know what
a small town is.
No, you listen to me.
Listen to me.
I said a small town.
He must know what a small...
Town is.
Listen to me, he's of no use to
us if Detroit is his idea...
Of a small town, you understand?
We'll chat later, 'Old Sport'.
All right.
Klipspringer.
He must be awake.
Shall we?
DAISY: Whoo!
NICK: Ho!
I wish I'd done everything
on earth with you.
All my life.
I wish it could
always be like this.
It will be.
NICK: If only it had been
enough for Gatsby...
But he had a grand vision for his
life and Daisy's part in it.
It wasn't until the
end of that summer...
On the last night
I saw Gatsby...
That he told me of the life he
had dreamed for himself since...
Gatsby's real name was...
James Gatz.
His parents were dirt-poor
farmers from north Dakota.
But he never accepted them
as his parents at all.
In his own imagination,
he was a son of God...
Chasing this destiny, a 16-year-old
Gatz ran far, far away.
One afternoon, off the
coast of lake superior...
He spotted a yacht in peril.
He rowed out and
rescued the vessel...
And it's captain, alcoholic
millionaire Dan Cody.
CODY: Where's the boat?
GATSBY: You're gonna
hit the shoal!
We're gonna hit the shoal!
What the hell are you doing...
His opportunity
and he seized it.
Right then and there to
call myself Jay Gatsby.
NICK: He sailed the
yacht out of danger...
Gatsby showed skill
and ambition.
And for five years,
they sailed the world.
Gatsby'. He was all
right, old Dan.
He taught me everything.
NICK: How to dress, act and
speak like a gentleman.
Gatsby. Jay Gatsby.
She looks well, doesn't she...
NICK: Gatsby hoped to
inherit Cody's fortune.
'Old Sport'? NICK: But
when Cody died...
Gatsby was cheated of his
inheritance by Cody's family.
He'd been left with the ability
to play the gentleman...
But he was once
again dirt-poor.
By midsummer, Gatsby
was front page news.
And it was the same
question on Tom's mind...
When he accompanied Daisy to one
of Gatsby's glittering parties.
I'll be right back.
You know, a lot of these...
Newly rich people are just...
- filthy bootleggers.
- Not Gatsby.
He's a businessman. He
owned a lot of drugstores.
TOM: Businessman!
May I introduce senator Gulick?
This is...
- Mr. Carraway.
- Senator.
- Mrs. Buchanan.
- Charmed.
Delighted.
Oh, and Mr. Buchanan...
The polo player.
- No, not me. GULICK:
Always a pleasure...
To meet a Buchanan.
TOM: Likewise. - I'll
catch up with you later.
- Perhaps at the craps table. - I'd
rather not be the polo player.
Tom. You should be proud
of your achievements.
May I show you around?
Sure.
GATSBY: You must
know the faces...
Of many people you've heard of!
DAISY: Absolutely.
We don't go around very much.
I don't think I recognize...
A single person.
GATSBY: Is that so?
Perhaps you know that lady...
Right there.
DAISY: It's Marlene moon.
I adore her pictures.
Would you like me
to introduce you?
I'd really rather not
be the polo player.
These things excite me so.
NICK: Nice little dance.
I believe we've met
before, Mr. Buchanan.
About a month ago.
That's right.
And you were with Nick here.
- At the barbershop.
- No, thank you.
That's right.
See, I know your wife.
That so?
Yes.
HERZOG: Mr. Gatsby, Sir.
- Mr. Slagle is here.
- Not now. Not now.
TRIMALCHIO:
- And guitars with.
"The foxtrot."
Mr. Buchanan.
Would you mind terribly?
Of course not.
I think I can keep
myself amused.
In case you need to take
down any addresses.
Please move aside. Excuse me.
Another swell party, Jay.
Be careful for the snake
charmer, Mr. McLennehan.
DAISY: Is all this
made entirely...
From your own imagination?
GATSBY: No.
You see, you were
there all along...
In every idea...
In every decision.
Of course, if anything
is not to your liking...
I'll change it.
It's perfect.
From your perfect...
Irresistible imagination.
I wonder...
Where the devil he met Daisy.
- I'll find you.
- All right.
Come with me.
SERVANT: Coming
through, please.
Pardon me.
Thank you.
There's a man
there's a man.
TOM: Have you seen my wife?
No.
Not for a while.
Whiskey.
It's funny, the senator
just saw her down here.
I wish we could just run away.
Run away?
No.
Daisy, darling, that
- that wouldn't be respectable.
TOM: You live...
Around here, Nick?
Just next door.
Is that so?
Gatsby'. We're
gonna live here...
In this house.
You...
And me.
Darling...
It's time to tell Tom.
WAITER: Come on, boys.
Scram!
Good night, gentlemen.
What a circus.
Well...
If you see her...
I'll be looking for her.
You tell her.
Remember how much fun we had?
I don't know why we can't just
have fun like that again.
NICK: Hello?
Hello, Nicky.
We're having a row.
- What about? DAISY: About...
Things.
About the future.
The future of...
The colored empires.
It's Tom.
- HE'S WANDERING AROUND THE
PARTY LOOKING HERZOG: Sir.
Mr. Gatsby, Sir.
It's Mr. Slagle. He's
quite emotional.
GATSBY: Excuse me.
Nick. Would you mind terribly?
Of course.
NICK: Gatsby disappeared...
To deal with a dispute
of some sort.
But Gatsby was
unable to return.
WOLFSHIEM: With these hot-headed
types in here, I rely on you.
But you were not available.
A scene was made.
What's going on with you, Jay?
TOM: Where were you?
DAISY: With Nicky. Mr. Gatsby
was showing us the grounds.
TOM: He certainly must have...
Strained himself to get
this menagerie together.
I'd like to know who he
is and what he does.
And I think I'll make a
point of finding out.
GATSBY: I'm not sure. Ask
them in the kitchen.
SERVANT 1: To the left.
SERVANT 2: Yeah...
We'll pile that stuff in the
garage, it's going back to town.
There you are. Daisy just left.
She asked me to tell you...
She had a wonderful time.
She didn't like it.
Of course she did.
No, no, no.
No, she didn't like it. She
did not have a good time.
I feel so far...
Away from her now.
It's so hard to make
her understand.
You mean about the party?
The party?
I couldn't care less
about the parties.
That'll be all for
now, gentlemen.
- Thank you. SERVANT
GATSBY: You see...
She has to tell Tom that
she never loved him.
What?
Yes.
Then we can go back to louisville
to her parents' house.
Her parents are lovely people,
'Old Sport'. We'll be...
Married there.
See...
See, Daisy and I are gonna start over
just as if it were five years ago.
I wouldn't ask too much of her.
Wouldn't ask too much?
No.
I beg your pardon, 'Old Sport'.
It's just
it's so sad, because it's
so hard to make her...
Understand.
It's so hard to make
her understand.
I've gotten all these things for her,
and now she just wants to run away.
She even wants...
To leave that. NICK: Jay.
You can't repeat the past.
Can't repeat the past?
No.
Why, of course you can.
Of course you can.
I'm gonna fix things...
Just the way they were before.
Everything's been so
confused since then. I...
NICK: He talked a lot
about the past...
As if he wanted to
recover something.
If I could just get
back to the start...
If I could just get
back to the start...
I could find it again.
Of himself that he had
put into loving Daisy.
One night in louisville,
five years ago...
Gatsby found himself at Daisy's
house by colossal accident.
"Gatsby". I went to her house first with
some of the officers from camp Taylor.
I'd never been in such
a beautiful house.
May I save the next dance?
NICK: His uniform hid...
- Daisy, don't scamper.
DAISY: I was not, mother.
So many dashing young
officers here.
And from such
illustrious families.
Gatsby'. I always knew
that I could climb.
That when I...
Kissed this girl...
I would be...
Forever wed to her.
So I stopped.
I stopped and I...
I waited.
His mind would never again
be free to romp like...
And then I just let myself go.
NICK: She blossomed for
him like a flower...
And the incarnation
was complete.
GATSBY: I knew it was a great mistake
for a man like me to fall in love.
I'm only 32. I might still be a great
man if I could forget that I once...
Lost Daisy, but...
My life, 'Old Sport', my life...
My life has got to be like this.
It's got to keep going up.
She has to go to Tom...
And tell him that she
never loved him.
I just need to give her
more time, 'Old Sport'.
More time.
Don't worry, 'Old Sport'.
Don't worry.
I can protect her here.
Good night, 'Old Sport'.
You're wrong about the
past, 'Old Sport'.
You're wrong.
NICK: There had been music
from my neighbor's...
All summer.
In his Blue gardens, men and girls
came and went like moths...
Among the whisperings and
the laughter and the stars.
Breakfast.
Yes.
Thank you, thank you.
Laughter.
Thank you.
No. The whisperings and the
champagne and the stars.
But...
After Tom and Daisy's visit...
Gatsby's lights went
out one by one.
For the very same fame
that had all summer...
Been a source of satisfaction
to Jay Gatsby...
I don't wanna go home.
Nick
I hear you fired all your servants.
Daisy comes over sometimes
in the afternoon.
I wanted people who wouldn't gossip
until we decide what we're going to do.
You see, these towns...
Are very close together,
'Old Sport'...
And, well, it gets in the
papers, you understand.
They're all people Wolfshiem
wanted to do something for.
What's the difference as
long as they can cook...
And make beds, right?
Nick...
There's just one thing.
She's requested that you and miss Baker
be there for lunch tomorrow at her house.
Will you come, 'Old Sport'?
I'll.
We need you.
Can you come, 'Old Sport'?
TOM: You know, I
read somewhere...
That the sun is getting
hotter every year.
Wait a minute.
It's the opposite.
Sun is getting colder...
Every year.
Oh, I would like to be out...
On that bay today.
I'm right across from you.
Right there.
Oh.
So you are.
GATSBY: You see...
Every night...
I can see...
That light...
At the end of your
dock blinking.
What light?
GATSBY: You see,
Mr. Buchanan...
I wanted to be close.
- Daisy and I have both.
- It's so hot!
Everything's...
So confused.
What'll we do this afternoon...
Or the day after that, or
for the next 30 years?
Oh, don't be morbid.
Let's go to town. Who
wants to go to town?
Town?
Women get these...
Notions.
Daisy.
You look so cool.
You always look so cool...
Like the advertisement...
Of the man in Times Square.
The man...
In the cool, beautiful shirts.
And Tom...
TOM: Let's go to town.
I'm perfectly willing.
It's a marvelous idea.
Henri! Have the car...
Brought around now.
DAISY: Can't anyone
at least have...
- a cigarette first? - We
smoked through lunch.
Come on, let's have fun.
It's too hot to fuss.
TOM: Daisy, it was
your great idea.
Why don't we? Let's
all go to town.
I changed my mind, you brute.
TOM: Come on. We'll get...
A great big room at the Plaza...
A bucket of ice...
A bottle of whiskey...
And it will be fun.
Come on.
It was your idea.
Fine. Have it your own way, Tom.
Come on, Jordan.
Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?
Two bottles of whiskey.
Wrap them in a towel.
Come on, Nick!
TOM: Mr. Gatsby...
Would you be good
enough to take...
My coupe, and I'll
drive everyone else...
In your circus wagon.
GATSBY: I don't think...
There's much gas, 'Old Sport'.
TOM: No, plenty of gas.
Well, if I run out, I'll stop...
At a drugstore. I
hear you can...
Buy anything at a
drugstore nowdays.
You take Nick and Jordan.
GATSBY: I suppose you can...
- yes. - We'll meet
you at the Plaza.
I'll be the man on the corner...
Smoking two cigarettes!
TOM: You must think I'm
pretty dumb, don't you?
Well, I have a second sight
sometimes that tells me what to do.
I've made a small investigation
into this fellow.
JORDAN: And you
found he was...
- an Oxford man?
- Oxford, new Mexico.
He wears a pink suit,
for chrissake.
JORDAN: Tom, we're
almost out of gas.
TOM: Wilson!
Wilson!
What are you waiting for?
- Let's have some gas!
- Uhh.
Do I have to do it myself?
You think I come here
to admire the view?
- I'm sorry, I'm sick.
TOM: Why?
- Why, what's the matter?
WILSON: I don't know.
I'm all run down.
I need money...
- real bad.
- What?
My wife and I, we wanna go west.
Oh, your wife does?
NICK: Tom was feeling...
The hot whips of panic.
His mistress...
And wife...
Were both slipping
from his control.
WILSON: I wised up
to something...
Funny these last two days.
Yeah, she's going west...
Whether she wants to or not.
What do I owe you?
WILSON: A dollar.
- $1.20. TOM: You
can have the car.
I'll send it over tomorrow!
Okay, fine, fine, fine.
DAISY: Open another window.
There aren't any more.
DAISY: Then telephone...
For an ax.
TOM: Will you forget
about the heat?
You make it worse by
crabbing about it.
Why not let her
alone, 'Old Sport'?
TOM: That's a great
expression...
Of yours, isn't it?
GATSBY: What is?
'Old Sport'."
- Where'd you pick it up?
- See here.
If you're going to make
personal remarks...
I won't stay here a minute.
Mr. Gatsby...
I understand that
you're an Oxford man.
No, not exactly, no.
Oh, yes, I understand that...
You went to Oxford.
- Well, yes, I went there.
TOM: Sure.
- The man in the pink suit
went to Oxford. - Tom.
I said I went there, didn't I?
TOM: Oh, I heard you.
I'd like to know when.
You'd like to know when.
Well, Mr. Gatsby?
It was in 1919. I only
stayed there five months.
That's why I can't
exactly call myself...
An Oxford man.
You see, it was an opportunity they
gave to some of us officers...
Who fought in the war.
NICK: I wanted to
get up and slap...
DAISY: I'll make
you a drink, Tom.
- Then you won't seem so stupid
to yourself. TOM: Wait a minute.
I want to ask Mr. Gatsby
one more question.
Oh, please, please, go
on, Mr. Buchanan. Go on.
What kind of a row are you trying
to 'cause in my house anyhow?
He isn't causing a row, you're causing a
row. Please have a little self-control.
Self-control?
Oh, I suppose...
The latest thing
is to sit back...
And let Mr. nobody
from nowhere...
Make love to your wife.
Well, if that's the idea...
You can count me out.
See, nowdays people...
Begin by sneering...
At family life and
family institutions...
And the next you'll
know, we'll...
Throw everything overboard,
we'll have intermarriage...
Between black and white!
GATSBY: Your wife
doesn't love you.
She never...
Loved you.
You see, she loves me.
You must be crazy.
No, 'Old Sport'.
No, you see, she
never loved you.
She only married you
because I was poor...
And she was tired of waiting.
It was a terrible...
Terrible mistake,
but in her heart...
In her heart, she never loved...
Anyone but me.
- We should go.
- Let's all go home.
- Sit down, Daisy!
GATSBY: Please.
Please, take a seat.
Go on, Daisy.
TOM: Daisy...
What's been going on?
- I want to hear about it. - I
told you what's going on.
It's been going on
for five years.
You've been seeing him...
For five years?
No, no, no, not seeing. Not
seeing, we couldn't. But...
Both of us loved each other
all that time. Didn't we?
TOM: Oh, that's all.
Ha-ha-ha! You're crazy!
I can't speak about...
What happened five years ago
because I didn't know Daisy then.
And I'll be damned if I see how
you got within a mile of her...
Unless you brought the
groceries to the back door.
But all the rest of that...
Is a goddamn lie.
Daisy loved me...
When she married me...
And she loves me now.
GATSBY: No.
- No. I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan, no.
TOM: She does! She does, though.
No, she does, though.
She does. And what's
more, I love Daisy too.
No.
I love you, Daisy.
Now, once in a while...
I go off on a spree.
I always come back.
A spree.
TOM: And in my heart I
love her all the time.
You're revolting.
You know why we left...
Chicago? I'm surprised
they didn't treat you...
To the story of
that little spree!
That's all over now, Daisy,
darling. That's all over.
Just tell him the truth. Go on.
That you never loved him and this
will all be wiped out forever.
How could I love him...
Possibly? GATSBY:
Remember our plans.
You tell him that you never
loved him and all...
This pain will be wiped out...
Forever.
Daisy.
Daisy, tell him.
I never loved him.
Never?
- No.
- No.
Not at kapiolani?
Not that day I carried you down from
the punch bowl to keep your shoes dry?
Never?
Please don't.
Daisy.
There, Jay.
You want too much.
I love you now...
Isn't that enough?
I can't help...
What's past.
I did love him once,
but I loved you too.
You loved me too?
You loved me...?
Even that is a lie!
She didn't know you were alive!
There are things between
Daisy and me...
Gatsby, that you'll never know.
- Things that neither of us can
ever forget. GATSBY: I need to...
Speak to Daisy alone.
You see, you've got her all
excited now, don't you...
'Old Sport'? Daisy.
DAISY: Even alone...
I can't say I never loved torn.
It wouldn't be true.
- What? - Of course
it wouldn't.
- As if it mattered to you.
TOM: Of course it matters!
I'm gonna take better
care of you from now on.
You're not taking care of Daisy
anymore. She's leaving you.
Nonsense!
- I am, though!
TOM: No, no, no.
She is not leaving me.
Certainly not...
For a common swindler...
Like you.
Mr. Gatsby, exactly
who are you, anyhow?
I made an investigation...
Into your affairs. You're one...
Of Meyer Wolfshiem's bunch.
Please, let's go home.
See, he and this Wolfshiem...
They bought up drugstores.
And sold bootlegged...
Alcohol over the counter.
What about it, 'Old Sport'?
Don't you call me 'Old Sport'."
And this drugstore business...
Is just small change compared
to this bonds stunt...
That you and Wolfshiem
have got going.
Your friend Walter chase...
- isn't too proud to come in?
- I gave you...
That some thought.
How does a reputable banker...
Like Walter chase
find himself...
Up to his eyeballs in debt...
GATSBY: I'll tell you. To a
little kike like Wolfshiem?
- It's called greed, 'Old
Sport'. TOM: That's right!
And you have half of wall street
out there swilling your...
Free booze at that fun
park every weekend.
I'm surprised he hasn't
tried to drag you in.
My God, he has.
He's got nothing to do with
with your little racket.
Daisy.
Daisy.
Can't you see who this guy is...
With his house and his parties
and his fancy clothes?
He is just a front...
For Wolfshiem, a gangster...
To get his claws into respectable
folk like Walter chase.
The only respectable thing about
you, 'Old Sport', is your money.
Your money, that's it.
Now I've just as much...
As you. That means we're equal.
Oh, no. No.
We're different.
I am.
They are.
She is.
We're all different from you.
You see, we were born...
Different.
It's in our blood...
And nothing that you
do or say or steal...
Or dream up can
ever change that.
A girl like Daisy
you shut up!
Shut up!
You shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
NICK: Gatsby looked,
in that moment...
My sincerest
my sincerest apologies.
I seem to have...
Lost my temper.
That's right, Mr. Gatsby.
Show us some of those fine...
Oxford manners. GATSBY:
Daisy, darling.
None of this has
any consequence.
Daisy.
Daisy, talk to me, darling.
I just lost my
temper, that's all.
Excitedly, but
with every word...
Daisy was drawing further
and further into herself.
- To go to your parents'
house in louisville.
Please, Tom, I can't...
Stand it anymore!
Why don't you two
start on home...
In Mr. Gatsby's car.
- Daisy, darling, look at me.
TOM: Go on.
Daisy.
He won't annoy you.
I think he realizes...
- that this little flirtation
is over. - Daisy?!
Daisy!
You want any of this?
Jordan?
Nick?
Nick.
What?
You want any?
No.
I just remembered...
Today's my birthday.
TOM: Happy Birthday.
NICK: Thirty. The promise
of a decade of loneliness.
The formidable stroke
of 30 died away...
As Gatsby and Daisy drove on
through the cooling twilight...
WILSON: Don't you lie to me!
Hey, where'd you get these from?
You might fool me,
but you don't...
Fool God!
God sees everything!
Myrtle!
Where are you?
MYRTLE: Tom?
Torn!
Torn!
WILSON: Myrtle!
MYRTLE: I'm here! Stop!
Baby!
Torn!
Wait!
POLICEMAN 1: Slow down.
Slow down!
Bad trouble up ahead, Sir!
TOM: Good. Wilson'll have a
little business at last.
Let's take a look.
Oh, must we?
Just a look.
Come on.
POLICEMAN 2: Move back!
Clear the space here!
Have a little respect!
If you don't have a legitimate
reason to be in the building...
I want you outside!
If you saw anything tonight you'd like to
talk to me about, well, then you can...
Talk to me outside.
I don't want you in here. Okay?
POLICEMAN 2: Please. Stand back.
Please.
WILSON: My God.
POLICEMAN 2: All right, folks.
Make some room, huh? Make
some room back there!
If you have no
business, clear out!
POLICEMAN 2: Sir.
What are you doing? Sir!
Sir, I'm asking you
get off me!
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
POLICEMAN 2: You knew her, eh?
Not really. No.
POLICEMAN 2: I gotta ask
you to step back, Sir.
So, what happened?
She ran out in the road.
- Son of a bitch didn't even
stop his car. MAN 1: Hey.
I saw it. It was a yellow car.
A big yellow car.
MAN 2: Damn thing
came out of nowhere.
Yeah. Yeah, a big yellow...
Duesy. Custom job.
WILSON: You don't have to tell
me what kind of car it was.
I know what kind of car it was.
Wilson.
- Just pull yourself together! - I
know what kind of car it was!
He's upset! Everybody out!
Can't you see the man
needs peace and quiet?
Wilson! I just got
here from New York.
No! Hey! Wilson!
I was bringing you the coupé.
Sit down! Sit down.
Get him a drink.
Get him a drink.
That yellow car wasn't mine!
You hear? I haven't...
Seen it all afternoon.
POLICEMAN 2: Hey!
What color's your car?
It's Blue.
Coupé.
We just got here from New York.
They just stopped!
Ok!
Blue.
Right.
Here.
Leave us alone.
Wilson.
Who owns the yellow car?
A fella named Gatsby.
Jay Gatsby.
He's a crook, George.
Yes. Throws those parties the
papers are always talking about.
Maybe he was the one that was
fooling around with Myrtle.
Maybe...
That's why he killed her.
Yeah, maybe.
Guy like that, who knows?
He didn't have to kill her.
TOM: Gatsby.
Something ought to be done
about a fella like that.
Coward.
He didn't even stop his car.
You gonna defend him now?
Huh?
TOM: I'll telephone
for a taxi, Nick.
Why don't you come inside
and have some supper...
While you wait?
No, thanks. I'll wait outside.
What is the matter...
With you?
Won't you come in, Nick?
No, thanks.
It's only half past 9.
No, I've had enough.
Of everyone.
GATSBY: Hello, 'Old Sport'.
NICK: What are you doing?
GATSBY: Just sitting here.
Yes, I see that.
You see any trouble
out on the road?
That woman...
- you ran down is dead, Jay.
- I thought so.
I told Daisy that I thought so.
Daisy? Do you hear yourself?
How could you?
How could you do that?
Keep your voice down.
NICK: You're nothing...
- but a goddamn coward!
- Keep your voice down!
Please. There was
no point in stop
no point'? No point?
What about that woman?
No point. She was
killed instantly.
Yes, it ripped her open!
I was there! I saw her!
I understand! I understand!
It was my fault.
It was my fault. This woman...
She rushed out at us as if she
was trying to speak to us.
It all happened so quickly.
She tried-I tried...
- to turn in time...
- "She"?
But
it was Daisy.
Well, I...
You see, after we left New
York, she was very nervous.
She thought that driving
would steady her.
But this woman, she rushed...
It all happened so quickly.
It wasn't her fault...
No one must know that
Daisy was driving.
Promise me.
Jay, you should go home
and get some rest.
I'm going to wait here. I'm
going to wait here all night...
- if necessary.
- No, no, no.
- That's not a good idea.
- If he tries...
To bother her about that
unpleasantness this afternoon...
If he tries to bother her...
If he tries any brutality
on her whatsoever
torn won't touch her. He's
not even thinking about her.
I don't trust him.
- I don't trust him.
- All right.
All right.
You wait here.
I'll see if there's
any commotion.
Would you?
Thank you, 'Old Sport'.
TOM: Listen, she was in the
wrong, running out on the road.
Sweetheart, you have...
Nothing to worry about.
Let me take care of things.
Take care of you.
I'll make some calls.
We'll go away.
Just go away, get out of town.
Get some rest. Don't worry.
It'll be all right.
Hey
Oh. Hello, 'Old Sport'.
Jay
- everything all right?
- Yes.
Everything's just fine.
Around 4:00, she
came to the window.
She stood there, then...
Then she turned out
the light, so...
Well...
Give me a hand, will
you, 'Old Sport'?
NICK: I should have told him
what I had just seen, but...
You know, Jay, with
everything that's happened...
You ought to go away.
Tonight. They'll trace your car.
Go away? No, I can't leave now.
Not tonight.
Jay, do you understand that
a woman has been killed?
Daisy's going to
call in the morning.
Then we'll make plans
to go away together.
- Yeah.
- Daisy, she
she just needs time to think
things through. Herzog...
We're talking. Thank you.
She just needs time to think.
No, Jay. With Daisy
she just needs time to think. She's
going to call in the morning.
Wait up with me.
The sun's almost up.
NICK: That was the night he
finally told me the truth.
GATSBY: You know, I've
thought for a while...
I had a lot of things, but
the truth is I'm empty.
I suppose that's why I make
things up about myself.
But I've wanted to tell you
the whole story for...
A very long time.
See, I grew up terribly,
terribly poor, 'Old Sport'.
- My folks were... NICK: He
revealed his humble beginnings...
His transformative
voyage with Dan Cody...
And how he joined Wolfshiem
in the business.
That I became aware of Gatsby's
extraordinary gift for hope.
I can't describe how surprised I
was to find out that I loved her.
And that she loved me too.
NICK: A gift that I have never
found in any other person.
I never realized how
extraordinary...
A nice girl could be.
And which it is not likely
I shall ever find again.
I thought out my life
with Daisy in it...
Trying to figure out
how we could marry...
And struggle along on so
many dollars a month.
What was in the letter?
The reason why after the war I
hadn't been able to return.
I asked her to wait until I made
something of myself, but she was...
See, I felt married to her.
That was all.
HERZOG: Mr. Gatsby,
Sir, excuse me.
Chicago calling, Sir.
Not now.
Keep it open for
a personal call.
HERZOG: A personal call? Of
course. GARDENER: Excuse me, Sir.
Mr. Gatsby, I'm gonna
drain the pool.
Before the leaves
start falling in.
Not today.
Not today, it's so beautiful.
You know, 'Old Sport', I haven't used that
pool once all summer. Let's take a swim.
Have the phone brought
down to the pool.
I have to go, Jay.
I have to work.
I understand.
Well...
I'll walk you out.
Well, I'll call you up.
Please do, 'Old Sport'.
Please do.
I supposed.
That Daisy will call too.
I suppose.
Yes.
Well, goodbye.
NICK: Jay!
They're a rotten crowd.
You're worth the whole
damn bunch put together.
Wall street boomed
it's usual...
But I wasn't worth a
decent stroke of work.
I waited for Gatsby
to call with news.
For Daisy.
HERZOG: Gatsby's.
I know Mr. Gatsby will be very
happy that you've called.
Daisy.
Hello! Hello!
Hello! Is everything
all right?
Hello! Hello!
Hello!
Hello! Is everything
all right?
NICK: I remember the rest of
that day as an endless drill...
Of police and photographers
and tabloid reporters.
The headlines
were a nightmare.
They pinned
everything on Gatsby.
The affair with Myrtle. The
hit-and-run. Everything.
And there was nothing
I could say...
Except the one unutterable
fact that none of it was true.
DAISY: Darling, daddy's taking
care of his two favorite girls.
PAMMY: Where are we going?
- We're going on a holiday.
TOM: We should go.
DAISY: Just you...
Me and daddy.
Buchanan residence.
NICK: May I speak
to Mrs. Buchanan?
It's Mr. Carraway, her cousin.
Is not available,
monsieur Carraway.
If you speak to her, tell
her the funeral's tomorrow.
I'm sorry, monsieur,
they have gone away.
Do you know when
they'll be back?
No.
Please. I know that she would
want to be there. She would.
If you would just get
a message to her.
- Let me talk to her, please.
HENRI: You wish to contact her?
I have no further
information, monsieur.
Please!
Hello?
TOM: Come on.
NICK: They were careless
people, Tom and Daisy.
They smashed up
things and people...
And then retreated back into
their money and their...
Hey
hey! Get out of here!
Go on!
Get the hell out of here!
I wrote...
But not a single one of the sparkling
hundreds that enjoyed his hospitality...
My once Golden
shimmering mirage...
In New York...
"Jordan". He threw
all those parties...
Hoping she'd wander
in one night.
NICK: It's like an
amusement park.
DAISY: But how do you
live here all alone?
GATSBY: She makes it
look so splendid...
Don't you think, 'Old Sport'?
DAISY: Music! And
then we can...
Dance all night!
GATSBY: Will you
come, 'Old Sport'?
DAISY: I wish it could
always be like this.
It will be.
NICK: I remembered how we had all come to
Gatsby's and guessed at his corruption...
DAISY: It's perfect. From your
perfect, irresistible imagination.
And as I stood there, brooding
on the old, unknown world...
I thought of
Gatsby's wonder...
When he first picked out the green
light at the end of Daisy's dock.
And his dream must have
seemed so close...
That he could hardly
fail to grasp it.
That it was already
behind him.
Gatsby believed in
the green light...
The orgastic future that
year by year recedes...
It eluded us then, but
that's no matter.
Tomorrow, we will
run faster...
Stretch out our
arms farther...
