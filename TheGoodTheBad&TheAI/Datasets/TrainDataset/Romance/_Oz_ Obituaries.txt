Obituaries.
A man or a woman
lives their entire life,
they work and love
and dream and laugh and cry.
Then they die.
And then somebody
who they don't even know,
who's never met them once,
boils their entire life
down to a paragraph or two
in a local newspaper.
And that's only if they
achieved something--
something that the editor
thinks is important.
Now if they're real movers,
real shakers,
maybe they get two columns.
Maybe they get
a photo from 197 4.
lf they've achieved nothing,
they get buried
at the bottom of the page
or ignored completely.
The homicide unit has finished
its investigation.
Guillaume Tarrant shot
seven people before killing himself.
Four people are dead:
officer Joseph Howard,
and prisoners Lou Wrath,
Junior Pierce and Kenny White.
What's the status of the other
three inmates, Keller, Seran and Ahmad?
They're all
at Mission Memorial.
Seran and Ahmad
had superficial wounds.
They should be back today,
but Keller had internal damage.
He'll be in the hospital
a while.
Yeah, l keep
asking myself,
how did that fucking gun
get in Oz?
l don't know,
Murphy.
But l'm sure as Christ
gonna find out.
We don't know
where the gun came from.
Why are you asking us? That was
a white man's finger on the trigger.
l'm talking to everyone.
Whether you find out
the truth or not,
one thing is clear--
Emerald City
is out of control.
McManus must go.
You telling me who to hire
and who to fire, Adebisi?
Just pointing out reality.
McManus was lax.
Ultimately, the responsibility is his.
And you better act fast.
The press wants answers.
- Public wants someone to blame.
- Thank you for your concern.
You two were very chummy
in there.
Rare finding
such agreement.
So you are saying
you don't want McManus to be fired?
See that?
What is going on?
What do you care?
You lost the taste of power,
isn't that what you said?
- Yeah.
- You're outta this.
Beginning of the day,
the way to wisdom,
the wish, the will
to treat, to try, to trip.
You can memorialize
them hacks--
Shut the fuck
up, already!
But my brothers, they're on the backs
in corners like roaches
- after another Raid sweeping?
- Come on, man, enough!
Back of the thigh,
the glimmer in the eye--
Poet, Poet.
- Enough.
- Get the fuck away from me.
You know, Bricks
and Junior is dead.
- Dead!
- You and me are alive.
They had no heart,
Adebisi.
l have a heart.
l have a heart
of a lion.
lnstead of crying for Kenny and Junior,
help me revenge them.
Revenge against who,
Adebisi?
Tarrant greased
himself.
You see,
against them.
All of those
white bastards.
lt wasn't no fucking
white bastard
that poured hot soup on my face,
scarring my skin.
That was you.
That was you!
Yeah, that was then.
This is now.
lf you'd been standing one inch
to the left when the shooting started,
you'd be dead, and Kenny Wangler
would be my new best friend.
Yo, shit's going down.
Yeah, but what? We're on the outside,
nose against the glass.
Yeah, not for long,
brother.
Fuckin' hacks wanted to know
how Frenchy got the gun.
And you know
who did?
Fucking Cocola,
man, Adebisi.
l saw him with the gun
the day before the shooting.
Does Adebisi know
you know?
Not yet. Probably he gonna
find out soon enough.
lntegrity...
it's what sets real leaders apart
from typical politicians.
One man running for governor
has real integrity.
Alvah Case.
Activist lawyer,
Law School Dean,
State Bar President.
Nobody questions
his integrity.
So after the riots
at Oswald Prison,
to whom did even James Devlin turn
to sort it out?
That's right. Alvah Case.
Unquestioned integrity. For a change.
Wendy.
McManus has to go.
- Seems to be the mantra of the week.
- Have you seen the Trib?
Front page,
above the fold.
Prison shooting leaves
four dead and two Op Ed pieces.
l can handle a little
negative press.
Not if you want to be
Lieutenant Governor.
You need a scapegoat.
You have to fire McManus.
- Now is not the time.
- He's screwed up from the get-go.
- Have you forgotten the riot?
- The riot was not Tim's fault.
This entire history
of Emerald City has been a disaster.
He's a weak limp-wristed
liberal
and you gotta toss him out
with the other garbage.
Here's your mail.
You're welcome.
''Dear Tim, l know by now
that Sister Pete
has given you the news
that l'm not
coming back to Oz.
This all must seem
unreal to you.
lt sure as hell
does to me.
When l left
two weeks ago on vacation,
l never dreamed that my
entire life
could turn around
so far or so fast.
l never dreamed that l would meet
a man like Cary, so loving,
so understanding.''
l've been asked
to pick one staff member
to serve as part
of a state delegation
that's going
to South Africa
for a discussion
of human rights issues.
That group will visit
the Pretoria Prison,
the Zonderwater Prison,
as well as--
- go on safari.
- Sorry.
Leo, l just want
to talk for one minute, okay?
- l'm in the middle of something.
- Just one minute
about Officer Howard's
memorial service.
lt's important,
God damn it,
because the man was killed
right in front of me.
All right,
go ahead.
Okay, uh...
l think that we should
videotape the ceremony
so that when
his grandkids get older,
they can watch it.
Eternal rest grant
onto him, O Lord,
and let perpetual light
shine down upon him.
Amen.
And now, Tim McManus
would like to say a few words.
Tim?
Joe loved
to bet on horses.
And so in honor of him,
l would like to--
Come in.
Leo, we want
to talk about Tim.
l've had all the discussions
about Tim McManus
- l'm gonna have.
- He's clearly in distress.
- Yes.
- He needs help.
- That's what l told him.
- So you've seen him?
- We've been looking everywhere.
- He just left.
- Where did he go?
- l have no idea.
We'll try him
at home tonight.
- lf not, we'll see him here tomorrow.
- Right.
- l don't think so.
- Why not?
l just fired him.
Good night.
l saw this obituary once
of a guy l knew.
And the newspaper
had misspelled his name.
They misspelled his goddamn
motherfuckin' name.
And that's it.
There ain't no goin' back.
lt's not like they're gonna get
his name right
the next time
he dies. No.
That edition
of the newspaper
is going in the archives.
And this guy l know--
his name,
which is probably
the thing he's proudest of in life,
it's gonna be wrong,
forever and ever.
All right,
everybody listen up.
Last night
Tim McManus resigned
as Unit Manager of Emerald City.
All right, quiet down!
Until a new unit manager
is named,
the warden has asked me
to temporarily
take over McManus' duties.
Hear this:
Nothing,
and l mean nothing's
gonna change.
Yeah, that's what
you think.
All right, that's it!
Officer Murphy?
Have you heard the latest
on Chris Keller?
l haven't heard
anything new.
- Could you, um, call and check on his--
- Beecher,
we had a major
incident here, all right?
Now we lose Tim McManus.
Your boyfriend's health
ain't a priority
for me.
- Please?
- Go away.
l asked my father
to locate Schillinger's other son.
Oz didn't make
you a bitch.
You were born one.
- Yeah, okay.
- Come here.
You're tormented in your role
in the death over Andrew Schillinger.
You went looking
and you came to me.
You asked for guidance
in the ways of lslam.
You sought comfort,
peace of mind in the arms of Allah.
But you have this...
thing between you
and Keller.
Homosexual acts
are blasphemy.
l know that.
l want to love him,
Kareem.
l do.
And as for Allah,
l'll take my chances with him
when the time comes.
Hey, Beecher.
Sorry about what happened
to your little butt buddy.
Knowing that kind,
he's probably fucked half his nurses
and a couple
of orderlies by now.
Hope he doesn't come back to you
with any of them staff infections.
- Toby.
- Hey, Dad.
Good news.
We found Hank Schillinger,
by the way.
Well, Jesus,
that was fast.
Well, l told you
Swannee's the best.
And if you turn over
the right rock, you'll find a worm.
Meaning?
Hank Schillinger
is one screwed up kid.
Swannee said he's a--
he's a drug addict,
he's a petty thief.
He pimped
his girlfriend.
How long before he'll come
and visit Schillinger?
Well, there's one
slight complication.
Boy says he won't come
unless he gets paid.
Paid how much?
l don't know.
Probably what it'll cost
to get him his next high.
Make the deal.
- Toby--
- Make the deal, Dad.
Vern.
What the hell--
sorry, heck do you want?
You have
a visitor.
What, suddenly you're
my appointment secretary?
Hank is here.
Hank?
My Hank?
Your father's
on his way.
So when do l get
the other half of the money?
When you're done.
Cool.
So bring him on.
How long is this
gonna take?
'Cause l got
to meet somebody.
Dude, you look
awesome.
Hello, son.
Skinny as shit.
They don't feed you
in here?
Oh God.
Good to see you.
Let me look
at you.
How you doing?
l mean about Andrew?
l miss him.
But before he
got clipped,
we weren't hanging
as much together.
All the freaks
he'd be with,
dragging a nigger
from the back of a truck?
What is that shit?
Well, come on,
sit down.
So much l want
to talk to you about.
Well, l'd love
that, but l mean, l've got to bolt.
Hank, you--
you just got here.
Hank.
Yeah, you know,
fuck it.
l got time.
l mean,
you're my daddy,
right?
How'd it go?
Well, it started
out kind of bizarre,
but Hank eventually
settled down.
- And Schillinger?
- l've never actually seen him happy.
But that's what
he seems to be.
He asked Hank
to come back.
Hank said yes, but whether he shows up
is anybody's guess.
l'll make sure
he does.
You know, the most
startling thing for me
is how much Schillinger
truly loves this kid.
- Father.
- Yeah?
Have you ever loved
anybody too much?
Of course.
You're not allowed.
l mean,
the celibacy thing.
l guess my question is,
is it wrong to love
somebody too much?
Well l guess that depends
on how the love manifests itself.
And the answer
to your first question is
yes, l have.
You've got to pity the guy who had
one thing go wrong his whole life.
l mean, other than that one thing
that got fucked up,
he led a good,
average life.
But some incident
or other,
some bad decision
or bad behavior, which maybe gained
him a moment of notoriety,
that'll be the headline
in his obit when he dies.
You know, like,
Charles van Doren,
''Quiz Show Scandal.''
No matter what else
he's done,
that's how he'll
be remembered
forever and ever.
Sorry.
- She yours?
- My girlfriend.
Oh yeah?
My wife.
The lieutenant wants
an update.
He wants to know
when he's going to see some arrests.
The shooting has brought
everything to a complete standstill.
Two of the guys on my initial drug
connections got killed.
Take it slow,
partner.
l know,
l know.
But l gotta
tell you,
l don't want to spend any more time
in this place than l have to.
l miss my wife
constantly.
And lately, l--
l feel like
l'm losing her.
Think she's sleeping
with another guy?
No, l'm just
becoming
less and less
important to her.
She's filling
in the space that l left.
That could never happen
to Kina and me.
- No?
- No.
Yeah, we'll see.
Where's she from?
DC.
Really?
Why?
She looked
familiar to me.
l was trying to figure
out from where.
How long she been
in the city?
Six months
or so.
l definitely
don't know her.
All right, man.
All right!
Hey Kina,
did you ever have any run-ins
with a guy named Augustus Hill?
Yeah, l thought so.
He says he recognized you.
l think, to be safe,
you shouldn't come visit for awhile.
Uh-huh.
You know, in Jamaica,
l worked the life.
- Yeah?
- Maybe you have a place for me.
So many of your men
were killed.
Let me speak
to some people.
Mr. Adebisi.
Nice island,
- Jamaica.
- You've been?
l ask the questions.
Understood.
How is Junior Numbah doing?
l know who he is,
but we have never
danced together.
Marco Sauri?
Again,
l know of him.
William Pouches?
Him l don't
know at all.
That's because
l made him up.
You know Aylum King?
Barely.
Then who do
you know?
Who can vouch
for you?
Nesta Parks.
Nesta Parks?
He's in Levin.
Serving 15 years.
You can go now.
Give me a chance
to prove myself.
Go.
Poet,
contact Nesta Parks.
l want to hear stories
about our new monkey.
- So the trial starts today.
- Yes.
And l plan
to go to court
and be there every day
until we get justice.
Oh and you're
certain that we will get justice.
l have a very good
feeling about this.
l think we're
going to win.
l think the State
and this prison
and Devlin are gonna have
to finally face the facts
that after all
these years,
they were responsible
for the riot.
Well, they
were responsible
for all the inmates
who were injured.
And the men,
like my brother,
who died.
You're laughing
at me?
No, l'm not
laughing at you.
l just remember the frightened
little girl that you were.
And l'm stunned.
l'm very pleased
at all the changes
within you.
l wanna kiss you.
l wish we could.
You know what?
Everything that
l respect about you
also really
pisses me off.
Okay.
l've asked you all here today,
because as co-plaintiffs,
l'm going to give
you an update
on the lawsuit
against the State.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We saw that on the news.
When do we get
our fucking money?
As l have said,
O'Reily,
this is not
about money.
This is about the State
admitting culpability in the riot.
Excuse me,
will each of us be testifying?
l doubt it.
l have all
of your depositions.
And our lawyer,
Arnie Zelman,
he believes that only
one of us is necessary
to plead our case
in court.
And that someone
would be you.
Yes.
l leave in an hour.
lt's taking all these months
for the trial to start.
How long before
the jury reaches a verdict?
l would say about a week.
Well, aren't we
feeling optimistic?
Given the fact that l believe
the American legal system
to be inherently corrupt,
unfair, chaotic--
oh yes.
l'm feeling
very optimistic.
- Take it away.
- Kareem.
- No, l absolutely refuse.
- lt's a new statewide requirement.
Whenever a prisoner
leaves a facility,
he or she must put on
an orange jumpsuit.
And if l wear that into court,
how do you think the jury will see me?
They will see me
as a criminal,
and that is someone who
is not to be believed.
You can't leave Oz
without it.
Go to the Board
of Prisons
- You get me a waiver.
- l tried.
Then you sue
the Board of Prisons.
Fine, and maybe
Judge Dolov will delay the proceedings
or maybe he won't. ln any case, the
legal haggling is going to eat up time.
l thought you wanted
this over as soon as possible.
You know
what l want?
l want this trial
done right.
Okay.
l'll file
the proper motions.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Back so soon?
Yeah. There was
a complication.
There always is
with you.
What did you mean
by that?
Well, you say
you're not in this for the money
and l believe that.
You say you are
in it for justice
and l think there's
something else involved.
l think you want
this case to fail.
lf the jury rejects
our lawsuit,
then you'll be able
to point with righteous indignation
at a system
that doesn't work.
But if we succeed,
then what do you have?
What can you
rage against?
So you'll do anything
to find a complication.
l will not be made
a slave to
by the laws
of this state, Beecher.
Yeah, well, that's where
you and l are different.
Because l love
the law.
Even though
it didn't work in my favor
and l ended up
in here,
l thank God every night
for the laws we have.
Because it keeps
people like
Adebisi and Hernandez
and Schillinger
away from my children.
You know what?
l'm gonna tell Zelman
that if he needs me to
l'm gonna testify
instead of you.
Beecher!
Beecher's testimony
about physical abuse
by guards at Oswald, before and after
the riot, stunned the jury.
- Beecher, look.
- How is Beecher doing this?
Beecher claims that even after
the SORT team had gained control,
prisoners were tortured.
This is Kevin Gersten,
reporting from the courthouse.
- You Mrs. Lazarus?
- Yes.
l got word someone
was waiting to see me.
l'm sorry,
do l know you?
No. Yes.
l was one of the jurors
at your trail.
Oh, you came to make sure
l was being punished?
No, l--
there is something
that has been haunting me
ever since you
were convicted.
What, you think
l'm innocent?
Oh, l know
you're guilty.
l know you killed
that young man
and cut off his head
and tried to ship it Airborne Express.
That is what makes
this whole thing so hard.
l am a Christian.
l know the difference between
what is God's will and what isn't.
l know that everyone
is owed a fair trial
and that means being
judged without prejudice.
Lady, what are you
jabbering about?
At your trial,
you were not judged without prejudice.
So then Mrs. Lazarus says
after the jury got sequestered
one of the other jurors,
a redneck motherfucker
announced to everybody,
''This shouldn't take long.
This guy's a fag.
All fags should be dead.''
Then he proceeds to bully
the rest of them, accusing anyone
who wanted to discuss my case
of being a fag.
Mrs. Lazarus says this juror
got them all to vote guilty
based solely on the fact
that l'm gay.
- Jesus.
- What are you gonna do?
l figure l've got
a shot at getting
the guilty
verdict overturned.
Maybe get a new trial.
Maybe get the fuck
out of here.
Hey, Mr. Said?
May we talk?
What is it that you and l could possibly
have to talk about?
Oh, you mean
because l'm queer?
And you Muslims
consider homosexuality
an abomination?
Yes.
There you have it.
Would you say you're prejudiced
against me?
No.
l pray every day
for your kind to find their way
to God.
Seems to me that makes you all
the more prejudiced.
l mean l'm not going
around asking Allah
to turn you
into a faggot.
What is it that you want?
Justice.
Shirley Bellinger's
execution has been set
for two weeks
from Thursday.
Now execution brings us
a lot of undue attention
from the media,
from protesters.
Shirley
is the first woman
to be executed in this state since
we're going to eat
more shit than usual.
- Warden?
- Yeah, Lopresti.
lf you're going to have TV cameras
up in death row,
you might want to think about having
the place painted.
Okay, all right.
l'll put somebody on it.
Anything else?
Shirley.
Good morning,
Officer Lopresti.
And who is this
fine gentleman?
Ralph Galino.
He's going to paint your cell.
How do you do?
Well, the truth be told,
l'm a little pissed off.
On the outside,
l was a contractor.
A housing complex
l built collapsed,
killed two people.
But it wasn't my fault.
l used
to supervise painters,
l never painted.
Somehow the warden
decided l was qualified.
Enough yapping, get to work.
Shirley, you can step out.
- Step out?
- Yeah.
The warden decided
you're free
to roam around here
until Galino's done.
Tell Mr. Glynn
l'm much obliged.
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- No problem.
l'm so sorry.
How are you
today, Nat?
Just fine, honey lamb.
What are you working on?
- A new dress.
- Fucking girlie queer bait.
Oh that pierces me
to the very bone.
Especially coming from a jizz-ball
who murdered his family.
- You murdered your family?
- Twice.
Prisoner #97M573,
Mark Miles;
Convicted
July 10th, 1997 ;
Three counts of murder
in the first degree.
Sentence: death.
You murdered two
of your families?
My, my.
That makes me feel like
a downright amateur.
l shot my wife
and my son.
l pleaded insanity, served 10 years
in the Conley lnstitute.
- l was cured.
- Fucking psychopath.
Well that's the pot
calling the kettle black, boy.
- Don't be fucking calling me ''boy.''
- Fuck you.
Gentlemen, please no ruckus.
At least wait until l'm dead.
- They set the date yet?
- Two weeks.
That don't fuck
with your head?
No.
After all the bullshit,
the trial, the appeals,
the miscarriage,
l'm ready to go.
l am ready
to meet my maker.
Of course,
whether he's ready
for the likes of me
is another story.
When you smile,
you are a very
attractive man.
For a nigger?
l admit, l have had
my prejudices.
But now that l am
so close to the end,
l see that
all of us is the same.
Same needs,
same desires.
- Yo, Lopresti!
- Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on here?
Just a little
fraternization.
That is not on
the goddamn program.
- Done.
- Good. Get inside.
Careful of the fumes,
you might get high.
l'm looking
forward to it.
Hey.
Hey, Pete, l was just
gonna come find you.
Oh yeah?
l had dinner last night
with Preston's parents.
lt's been awhile
since l'd seen them.
Anyway, l mentioned
your interaction program.
Really?
How'd they react?
Patricia seemed more intrigued
by the idea than Lars.
Would you like me
to call them?
Nope. l convinced them
to participate.
You?
l always had a really
good relationship with them
even though Preston married
outside of his religion,
outside his tribe.
lt's funny,
during dinner
Patricia kept saying,
''lt's not like we
blame you, Gloria.''
Which, of course, means that they do
blame me for Preston's death,
only they're too WASP
to be confrontational.
And then l realized
that l blame myself, too.
Cyril, stop that.
Put that down.
- Sorry.
- That's okay.
Cyril, you do understand that you
may have to talk to the mother,
the father and wife
of the man you killed.
Yes.
Dr. Nathan.
l like her.
When you meet them,
do you know what you
might want to say?
That--
that l want
to be their friend.
Ryan, how about you,
what do you want to say?
Hey, we're not here
for me.
We're here to cure him
of those nightmares.
No, no, no.
We're here to help you too.
l think you might
want to talk about
getting diagnosed
for breast cancer,
about how frightening
that was,
how kind Gloria was,
and how you developed
feelings for her,
and how that led to you having
Cyril murder Preston.
l still love her.
l do.
And that ain't never
going to go away.
Fuck!
l don't understand
why it's still bleeding.
Maybe Dr. Nathan should
take a look at it.
- What do you say?
- Dr. Nathan's gone for a few hours.
l think l'll see
if l can find Dr. Prestopnik.
Oh, fuck.
Sister Peter Marie,
l'd like you to meet
Lars and Patricia Nathan.
Hello.
Welcome.
- Thank you.
- Weren't you at Preston's funeral?
Yes, we spoke very briefly.
l wasn't sure if you'd remember.
l remember everything
about that day.
Why don't we all
sit down?
When Gloria asked us
about coming here,
l have to admit
l was skeptical.
l'm not sure
what good it'll do
bringing up
all those feelings again.
The bottom line, Lars,
is that by facing the men responsible
for your son's death,
you have the opportunity
to express things
- you might not otherwise get to say.
- That's what l told him.
Right, so from now
until then
we'll have a series
of conversations to help prepare you
for meeting
the O'Reily brothers.
Now at times the process
might seem slow,
frustrating,
even counterproductive--
We can drop out
at any time.
Yes, but ultimately
the experience can be
very satisfying
Let's get started.
What's the single most
important thing you want
to ask Cyril and Ryan?
Why did you murder my baby?
- Hey.
- Ryan?
Why do you use
the payphone?
To call out, Cyril.
That's why.
Why don't you use
your cell thing?
You mean
a cell phone?
'Cause they're illegal in Oz.
They're against the rules.
Then why does the man
who talks funny have one?
What man who talks funny?
Everyone in this shithole
talks funny, Cyril.
Him.
Stanislofsky's got
a cell phone?
- l saw him talking on it.
- Really?
Fuck.
You wait here, okay?
l'll be right back.
Nikolai.
Nikolai, Nikolai.
How's it hanging
there, buddy?
O'Reily.
Always a pleasure to see you.
Yeah, right.
You know, a little birdie
told me a secret about you
and l just came by
to see if it was true or not.
You got a cell phone?
No.
Well l guess
that's what l get
for listening
to little birdies, huh?
Because if you did
have a cell phone,
you'd let me borrow it.
You'd share, right?
Share?
Hmm.
Rent, maybe.
lf l had one,
which l don't.
l know. You told me
and l believe you.
Because that's just
the kind of trust that we have.
Yes.
Absolutely.
Well, l'm sorry
to disturb you.
Not a problem.
Bye, Nikolai.
There you go, Niko.
Eat hearty.
Yo, Pancamo.
My brother's sick.
l gotta get him back to Em City.
We're right in the middle
of fuckin' lunch.
l don't get him
back to Em City now,
he's going to blow chunks
right into that salad bowl.
Okay, okay.
Go, get him out of here.
Cyril. You all right?
Come on.
You feeling all right?
Come on, let's go.
But l--
l feel good, Ryan.
Shut up.
Stand here. Tell me if you see
Stanislofsky coming.
Fuck.
You fucking cocksucker.
Where's your fuckin' phone?
Couldn't find it,
could you?
- Find what?
- The cell phone.
Cell phone? l thought you said
you had no cell phone.
l don't.
Then how could l look for something
that doesn't exist?
Exactly.
- What's up, Jizz?
- Fuck you.
- Hey Ralph.
- What do you want?
Jesus, can't a guy
just be friendly?
l been here for days
and you ain't been friendly.
Well, that's why l'm here--
to make up for my lack of manners.
You mind if l sit?
Jesus, this mattress sucks.
Hard adjusting to life
in Oz, isn't it?
Especially with that jizz-bag
roommate of yours?
Hoyt? Hoyt is a pig.
l don't even know why
they moved me in here
after that French guy died.
You know what
the hardest part is?
Getting used to life
without all the trimmings.
l'm talking about sex,
a good cigar,
a fine bottle of vino,
a cell phone.
l didn't know
that cell phones weren't allowed.
Stanislofsky
set me straight.
Ralph, you grow
up in America?
Yeah.
Growing up, what was
the one enemy we had,
the one country that
we never trusted?
- Russia.
- Yeah.
Now, Stanislofsky, he's...
- Russian?
- Right.
He was telling you the truth
about not being allowed cells
but instead of turning yours in,
he kept yours for himself.
- Fucking cocksucker!
- lf l were you,
l'd go take back
what was mine.
Hey, you fuck.
l want my cell phone back.
Lower your voice.
Fuck you.
l want it.
You think l carry the thing
around with me?
l have to get it
from the hiding place.
lt will take time.
Okay.
l want the cell phone
in my hand by lights out.
Mr. Pancamo.
A question.
Ralph Galino.
ls he a friend of yours?
We don't associate.
So if he were ill,
or hurt
in an accident?
l don't care if that motherfucker
lives or dies.
Where the fuck are you going?
And don't tell me Cyril's sick.
- But l gotta do--
- The only thing you gotta do
is go back to work,
or l'll have you and your brother
transferred up
to making ladies' dresses.
- But l got to--
- Get to fucking work.
You got yourself
a deal.
That motherfucker!
Fuck!
You looking for Galino?
He went for a walk
with Hoyt.
Looks to me
like an OD.
Let's get him
to the morgue.
You played
this one well.
You covered all
the bases,
kept your
hands clean.
No one knows about the cell phone,
so no one suspects you.
That's nice.
l think l underestimated you,
Nikolai,
and l don't usually
do that.
Listen, we could drag
this thing out,
go to war,
but you know
eventually
l'd win.
So l say
let's just work together.
Like Russia and the US.
What was that called again?
Detente.
Detente.
Exactly.
What do
you say?
Miguel.
Miguel?
- Where am l?
- You're in the hospital ward.
Do you remember
what happened?
You were both stabbed
by William Giles.
Bevilaqua's dead.
You know, l promised
myself l'd never get stuck again,
and that little freak
Giles gets me.
What's with these?
Standard procedure
for anyone from solitary.
Chico, Chico,
Chico,
you fucking
disappoint me.
Why, El Cid?
l ask you to kill
Miguel Alvarez.
- ls he dead?
- No.
l don't like that
word, ''No.''
Carlos Martinez is in
the bed next to Alvarez.
But he's having trouble
getting a weapon.
l don't give a fuck
if his mother's in bed next to him,
get the fucking job done
or l'll find me another lieutenant.
Get the fuck out
of my face, now.
You having fun?
How you doing there Alvarez?
l heard what happened.
- How's Emerald City doing?
- Scary.
l'm in constant fear.
What are you gonna do?
Dig.
What?
Dig.
- You're digging another tunnel?
- Shh.
l'm almost done.
You're a crazy fuck.
You say that tomorrow,
you'll be saying it
to my backside.
Prisoner #98M232,
Carlos Martinez;
Convicted October 6th,
Two counts,
murder in the first degree.
Sentence: life without
the possibility of parole.
Fuck! Help!
Help!
Put it down,
Martinez!
There's no way
out so put the shank down, now!
Fuck you, bitch.
Down, motherfucker!
Count!
- Where is he, Rebadow?
- l don't know.
Don't bullshit me.
You guys are joined at the brain.
- Where's Busmalis?
- l really have no idea.
Check the log.
Where was he last?
On work detail
- mopping the hospital.
- l'll go check.
Busmalis, where are you?
Great!
Just great!
Central, this is 214.
We got a 69,
hospital unit.
Roger, copy that, over.
Ultimately, l guess it don't matter
what they write in your obituary,
because you ain't gonna
be around to read it.
Newsprint fades,
paper turns to pulp.
The mark you leave behind
has to be deeper.
The mark you leave behind
has to be on
another person's soul.
