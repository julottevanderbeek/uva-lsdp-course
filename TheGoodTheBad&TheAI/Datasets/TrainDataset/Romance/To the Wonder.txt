Woman:
It's coming in.
-
Why are you unhappy?
- Woman:
-
-
-
-
You want
a little sister
like that?
- Tatiana: How old is she?
- Woman #2: Three months.
Woman:
It would mean
I didn't love you.
I don't expect anything.
Just to go a little
of our way together.
- Woman: Stop being so serious!
-
Mother:
He's asking if you want
to come and live in
the United States.
-
A couple of months.
How do you
like it so far?
I like it.
- Do you have any children?
- I have a daughter.
She's 10.
-
Being a single mom.
I know my daughter's
a little younger,
But it would be fun for them
to get together, maybe.
It's kind of a hard age
to move away from someplace.
-
-
-
Mother:
-
-
-
There's tons of stuff.
It's super clean.
Everything is
beautiful here.
-
- look how clean
everything is.
Are you
going to marry her?
- She has pretty hair.

Pretty hands.
She can even make drinks.
It'll be great.
You'll be my stepdad.

Neil:
Remedial work?
We're looking to make sure
there's no toxins.
I got stuff on my house.
Kids acting strange.
Sometimes we see tar
Coming out in the cracks
in the patio.
The neighbors here,
they had their house
in escrow.
They pulled out.
The buyers pulled out.
That's too bad.
The reports
from the lab came in.
It showed the presence
of lead and cadmium
I've had it blonde
and brown and pink
- And red.
-
Me, I could never
dye my hair unless
my mom says I can.
My mom doesn't care.
My mom's pretty cool.
-
I'm writing my thoughts.
You love me?
of course.
We need to leave.
- Both of us.
-
There's something
missing.
-
-
And has its source above.
The husband is
to love his wife
As christ loved the church,
And give his life for her.
And I had a child.
But my husband
Started running
after other women.
And he left us
And went
to canary islands.
-
-
I didn't really want
to tell my dad
Because I knew
he would start yelling.
-
-
Girl:
-
-
- Priest:
-
And you see that blue
down below it?
That's the earth's shadow
on the atmosphere.
Look. You see
what I'm talking about?
Stop for a second.
- You see?
-
-
-  look at me.
I'm not looking at you.
I don't want
to look at you.
You're not my father.
You think you're my father.
You're not.
Marina:
Tatiana...
Tatiana:
You're annoying me.
Thank you very much.
So you will receive
the gift of joy.
Me?
'cause you don't
come out too much.
Do you get lonely all the time,
or most of the time
When ain't nobody around?
So what you got
to say about it?
You gotta have
a little more excitement.
Just like when me and you
are around, and there
ain't nobody around.
"hey!"
The power hits you, brother.
It always hits me.
You can just say, "hey, power,"
and it hits me.
Hits me before
I can get it out.
see, the devil don't know
what I'm saying.
I can feel the warmth
of the light, brother.
That's spiritual.
I'm feeling more
than just natural light.
Feeling the spiritual
light, see?
I can almost touch that light,
coming right from the sky.

-
-
The parish has grown a lot.
And we really
need more room
For the community
to get together.
We have plays,
we have dinners,
We have parties.
-
if I would have known
it was there...
-
my visa has expired.
We need to face the facts.
-
-
-
-
- Asking questions.  And it
makes everybody nervous...
-
Ain't this is our property?
Can't we do what we want
to do with it?
I tell my husband
to get us out of here,
but where we gonna go?
-
Man #2:
- And we can't get no help.
-
Even the dog
is acting funny.
We've been on this house
for a long time.
Woman:
I've been there
for some time.
I have to look at
Some of these creeks
and rivers--
Marina:
You talk
to my sister, right?
Marina:
Neil:
The tall grass prairie now.
Woman:
No, he claimed he didn't
want to have kids
While he was in school.
-
- neil:
So many student loans,
gambling debts
And this ranch
that's falling apart.
I caught you
on the right day then.
Neil:
Jane:
Will you pray with me?
Neil:
Jane:
- Is that what she said?
-
I told her I'd rather
Have a moonbeam than
The life I had before.
Jane:
I want you to come
more often.
Can you?
-
-
I don't know.
What are you laughing at?
You.
- Me?
- You make me laugh.
-
- you make me happy.
Jane:
Jane:
-
-
I trust you.
I want to be your wife.
I love you.
Jane:
-
-
Ma'am, if you'll come
over here.
Sir, if you'll be
on this side, please.
You all have rings
for each other?
...To love, honor
and cherish you...
Be faithful only to you...
As long
as we both shall live.
Marina:
-
-
-
-
-
-
- See my bracelet.
-
It's pretty.
Where's it from?
How's everything there?
It's great here.
No, I'm the one
who took it out.
And what you say,
Does it come
from god within?
-
And the I.U.D. That you
have in place there.
You and your husband
need to consider
Is with the absence
of the I.U.D.,
Is this a time
that you may want
to think about children?
So I don't need to have
a hysterectomy?
Thank you.
Marina:
Man:
Neil:
Go.

upon them
And upon this food
which we are about to eat.
Would you like one?
He just goes off

I don't know
where he goes.

Now that you're young.
Beautiful.
Your whole life
in front of you.
Live and do

Leave this place.
It's cramped.
Small.
There's nothing here.
Look at their faces.

All false.
You need to fly.
You should be free.
Listen to your heart.
Dead?

You're crazy!

When we come back.
It's hidden.
You don't need anything.
You're free.
We're gypsies.
You're like me.
A gypsy.
I'm my own experiment.
Come get me.
I'm here.
Where are the people?
They're all dead.
Nobody's here. Nothing.
I want somebody to surprise me.
- Where are you people?
-
What are you looking at?
You think I'm a monster?
An evil monster?
A vampire?
A witch?
-
-
I want to break
these chains...
things have gotten worse.
If I had done this,
I'm not saying I did,
I might've, I could've.
I can't help myself.
If you need me
to kneel down,
I'll kneel down.
I want to be free.
That sun is just
right in my eyes.
I can fight, I will fight.
I can fight
with my feet and hands.
They think they're
really about something,
but they ain't.

Forgive me.

Strength.
