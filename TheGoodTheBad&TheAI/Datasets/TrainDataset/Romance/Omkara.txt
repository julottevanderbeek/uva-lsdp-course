No stove has been fired in my
house since yesterday
Furthermore, humiliation in family
And how l can offer my flower like
Daughter to that wicked person
There is a difference of caste, too

That if anyone...
any person
has forced you or tried to kidnap you
Don't be afraid my daughter l am here
Just speak only truth
l am just bound of my will
Dad... Please forgive me
l can’t live without Omkara
* Don’t pay any attention to eyes
* Don’t listen to them
* Don’t pay any attention to eyes
* Don’t listen to them
* Don’t listen to them
* Eyes will cheat you...
* Eyes will cheat you...
* Eyes will cheat you...
* Eyes will cheat you...
* They’ll mesmerize you
* while you’re awake
* They’ll mesmerize you
* while awake and destroy your sleep
* Eyes will cheat you...
* Eyes will cheat you...
l was plunged in love with Omkara
But until l could fully realize it...
It was too late
* Don’t pay any attention to eyes...
* Eyes don’t differentiate
* between good and bad,
* loved ones and strangers
* They just love to sting
l was burning day & night in Omkara's love
Like a drowning sparrow in dark well!
l had no way to come up with
* Their poison is intoxicating
* Their poison is intoxicating
Finally, l decided to suicide
But then l thought l should inform that person
at least in whose love l am dieing
* Eyes show you rainbows in clouds
* which rain till morning
* They’ll show you rainbows
* and drive you mad
Rajju will come to marry me,
but just with my dead body
You've no courage to tell me
But l've the courage to say you that
* Eyes will cheat you...
l only love you and will remain yours forever
include my name in your murder list, too
Okay now forget it what has happened
Stand up daughter
You both request for pardon from
your lawyer father
Now, You will've to wait it for marriage
until l am released
it doesn’t make any difference
for us to be in prison
But if witness records
his statement in court then
Our name will be excluded
in coming election member list
And if they don't understand in a gentle way
Then go ahead with your own method
Mr. Omkara, be careful of a woman's trick
Which girl can cheat her father
what one can expect better from her
OMKARA
Fill it as you want
Hey catch this damn up... it is flying
Hey Gijlo... You know that to earn from illegal
sources has been written in our fate
Just from illegal sources...
Am l right, OM brother?
What do want Mr. Captain? Just tell
A seat in National Assembly
Our lndur brother is trying vigorously
For that for last 5 years
Even if he keeps trying for his 5 lives,
he can’t defeat our Tewari brother
You're exactly right
But that is when if he stands in election
His pant, shirt cost will be higher than
the money given to beat him
Understand
Hey... Omi wouldn’t you eat food?
Your sister-in-law has made Saag for you
Oh... Shit
Damn it
How much phone you will break captain?
Our workers are on the gate
of every channel station
At least see it completely

My Grand mom
She used to say that man's heart

But my grand mom used to say that path is
"just below the belly"
These have been sent by father for election
But the elections are too far away now

my father's business will be in danger
And you Langda brother
What you did of Omi?
When Omi made Kesu the administrator
of party before whole village
Don't l know that you were trying to be
