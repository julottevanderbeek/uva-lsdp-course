LILAH:
Smile, okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Smile. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Lilah, warden wants to see you.
Let's go. Move your ass.
- Did you bring it, baby?
- Hell yes.
- Don't go anywhere.
- I wouldn't dream of it.
LILAH: I could barely sleep last night.
- I like the sound of that.
Boy, was I looking forward
to coming to work today.
LILAH:
Almost ready.
Hot damn.
I think I'm gonna need a ruler. Oh.
- Mm.
- Where the hell did you get that from?
Another friend.
- That's my son.
- Yeah.
And if you wanna see him
outside of a pine box...
...I need to be in town in a half hour.
Try me, Eddie.
Even if I wanted to, how in the hell--?
Well, I've already thought of that.
There's a scared straight program
over at the visiting block.
It ends in 10 minutes. Let's go.
Move your ass.
ADMINISTRATOR: Everyone on the bus.
Let's go. Come on, ladies.
Eventually, you're gonna get caught,
Lilah.
I am gonna have a drink in my hand
and my toes in the sand.
That's what's gonna happen.
I'll send you a postcard.
Now, go keep those other guards busy,
or your kid's toast.
Is that everybody? And you are--?
Get me into town. Any problems,
and I'll stick you like a pig.
Smile. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.
ADMINISTRATOR:
She's with me. Fire it up.
The women
had their right breasts cut off.
It's from Greek mythology.
Amazos. "Without breast."
They had it removed to better facilitate
shooting a bow and arrow.
That is how the female warriors
got their name...
...not because they lived
in the Amazon Jungle, you child.
Call.
Three queens.
INMATE:
What a dick.
SHEA: Lloyd.
- Yes.
Let's go.
Our work-release van is leaving.
Pop it into neutral, Slick.
Daddy needs to fill his pockets.
Full house. Threes and twos.
- Jinx. You are a jinx, man!
- Van's leaving. Come on.
All right, ahem, you heard the man.
I will see you around
the gaming tables. I have to go.
GANGSTER: Hey.
- What?
I want my money.
Amen to that, brother.
I will absolutely pay you.
GANGSTER:
You've been serving that for two weeks.
I want it tonight, in my prison account,
or I'm gonna kill you.
Oh. Oh, man, that sounds an awful lot like
a maximum-security threat...
...and last I checked, we were in a decidedly
minimum-security establishment.
I will drive myself
back to a max house...
...before I let a mouthy-ass
white boy disrespect me.
How the hell
did you get into Maybelle, man?
I found Jesus.
Well. Oh.
Well, was it not Luke who said:
"But love thy enemy,
be good to him...
- ...and lend to him without expecting--"
- Luke don't owe me 800 bucks.
Dead.
Lilah Tompkins was five years
into a 25-year mandatory minimum...
...for killing her second husband.
She stabbed him 48 times.
First husband got killed in a house fire...
...which she was a suspect in,
but never convicted of.
This woman
is extremely dangerous.
- Jules, pull up her visitation log.
- Already put in a request.
Our only lifeline's
her 14-year-old son...
...who's currently
in foster care in New Jersey.
The FBI's at the family's house
in case Lilah tries to reach out to him.
Says here Lilah was, uh,
raised in foster care herself...
...from age 12 on.
- How'd she get out of Bixell?
- Threatened a guard's son.
Turned out to be a bluff.
Never had the kid.
- Guard's on his way in.
- Lloyd.
- Pay attention.
- I am.
- How old is the runner's daughter?
- She is 3.
It's a son, and he's 14.
- Pay attention.
- Noted.
My old celly finished her time at Bixell.
She's out now...
...but, uh, she'd give me whatever scoop
she's got on this Lilah chick.
Could you call her for us, please?
- Eddie Vaughan?
- Yeah.
Lilah's property.
CHARLIE: Could you step over here?
Thanks for coming by.
- Ray?
- Yeah.
- It's Teresa.
- Tell her I'll call her back.
- Who's Teresa?
- Don't worry about it.
This convicted killer has four hours on us.
Can we step it up?
Come here, come here, come here.
Come here, come here.
Come here.
Hey, you, uh, saw that card game, right?
There was some
world-class cheaters at that table.
- What do you want?
- I got zoomed. And I got taken...
...by a born-again thug,
who is apparently a complete fraud.
He said that if I don't pay him $800,
he's going to cap my ass.
Mm.
So I was--I was wondering if maybe...
...you could, like, jack him up...
...or, you know, I don't know, like,
get him to recognize.
- Okay, this is what I'm gonna do for you.
- Okay.
Zzz. Zero. You're on your own.
Thanks.
RAY: You weren't banging Lilah?
- No.
I'm telling you, I brought that outfit in
because she threatened my family.
You know, Eddie,
it's just a sexy teacher outfit.
- Seems like an odd request.
EDDIE: Yeah.
The answer's no, okay?
Look, I'm a married man.
I take my job serious.
- So stop asking me that question.
- All right, relax.
So, um, any nicknames that the female
inmates at Bixell called you?
- None that I know of.
- Ponytail-holder? That ring a bell?
Guards get called names.
- That's all part of the job.
- Right.
We're not investigating
sexual misconduct...
...between guards and inmates
at Bixell Penitentiary, yet.
So why don't you get straight with us
about Lilah, and if you do, guess what?
You never have to talk to us again,
dummy.
My wife has been going through
some health things.
- We haven't been intimate--
- The teacher's outfit...
...you brought that in voluntarily.
True or false?
Yeah. But I didn't know
she was gonna use it to escape.
- Did you give her the cell phone?
- No. Another friend gave it to her.
How did she get a photo of your son?
- I don't know.
- Who else was in her life?
I don't....
Son of a--
Maybe this one guy.
There were lawyers visiting her,
trying to get her conviction overturned.
That's who Lilah said they were.
Then one day I seen her kiss this guy
on the mouth...
...so I look into him.
Name is Lucas Harold.
Some loser who manages a go-cart track
out in Hempstead.
Any talk about what she'd do
if she ever got out?
- No.
- Never mentioned going to see her kid?
No, she never talked about him.
When I walked her out...
...she said that she gonna be
on a beach real soon, drinking a cocktail...
...and that she'd send me a postcard.
Lilah subscribed to two travel magazines
and had a travel guide to the Caribbean.
Okay, uh, port authority, train stations,
airports, cruise ships.
Send her mug shot to every one of them.
Also send it out to every U.S. embassy
in every country...
...that has a beach on it.
And, uh, go through the travel mags.
See if there are any pages that have been
dog-eared, torn out. Go through all of them.
Those kids on the track. There's something
off with their body language.
- Two teen males?
- Yeah. They're hiding something.
I should probably go
poke around a skosh, huh?
Yeah. Erica, go with him.
- Lucas Harold?
- Yeah.
U.S. Marshals. When's the last time
you heard from Lilah Tompkins?
Why? Something happen to Lilah?
I mean, you wouldn't be here unless--
- She escaped from Bixell six hours ago.
- Holy crow.
- Well, is she okay?
- Relax. We're looking for her now.
Holy crow.
- How do you know her?
- Well...
...we met through this
prison pen-pal program.
- We're in love.
- In love? Ha-ha-ha.
My bad.
- What is up, young bloods?
- Hey.
About to take a couple lap-a-rooskis
around the track?
Yeah.
You wanna put a wager on it?
- How much?
- Eight hundred bucks.
- Dude, what?
- Seven hundred.
Are you trying to screw this up?
I owe money back at Maybelle,
and if I don't come up with it, I'm dead.
This is your problem too.
If any of us screws up we all go back...
- ...sentences doubled.
- Ha, ha.
No, I'm pretty sure it's if one of us tries
to escape, we all get sent back.
There's nothing about getting killed
over prison debts.
That better be work-related.
Mother, where have you been?
- Did you buy her a car?
- No.
SHEA: A house?
- No.
Vacation spot?
No. Look, I manage a go-cart track, sir.
It's not like I have vacation property.
- Give money to one of her relatives?
- No.
Did you share a bank account?
RAY: Yes or no?
- Yes.
- Can you access that account from here?
LUCAS: Of course.
I think it makes perfect sense.
You have money,
you're aged, you don't need it.
I don't have money, I'm young,
I freaking need it.
LUCINDA :
- You're obviously soused now.
Prove it.
Count backwards from 100.
- Just do it. Try--
SHEA: Ouch. Eight grand.
- I really thought she loved me.
Okay, Julianne, thanks.
Can you text me the address?
Lilah drained this guy's bank account
from a branch at a mall...
...up in Valley Stream,
about 20 minutes from here.
Anything with the kids out there?
Goose egg.
CHARLIE:
All right, let's go. Thank you.
Marry me.
Baby. Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, you just made me
the happiest girl in the world.
- That's so sweet.
- Ha-ha-ha.
PRESCOTT: We've gotta call my mom.
She's gonna be so happy for us.
And surprised.
She never thought that it was gonna
amount to anything.
She's gonna be so happy for us.
Thank you.
CASHIER:
Congratulations.
- Hey.
- May I help you?
This woman withdrew, uh,
some money from the bank...
...at the other end of the mall.
Have you seen her?
No, I haven't. Sorry.
How much if I run a game of eight ball
on that table?
How much money?
No, jockstraps.
Yes, how much money?
I will do it twice.
I will do it twice in a row.
Sir, this is a store.
There's no gambling allowed at a store.
Whatever, man.
May I help you?
Hey, how you doing? Um....
Did you see this woman here today?
I mean, did this woman
happen to come....?
- Sir?
SHEA: Damn.
- Sir? She was here.
- Hmm?
We should give a heads up
to local motels...
...because judging from the gear
she bought, they're about to get to it.
- Anything on the guy she was with?
- Heavyset.
- Other than that, she didn't notice him.
- Guys.
I'm convinced Lilah
has narcissistic personality disorder.
Subtype: manipulative narcissist.
Grandiose, expects deference from others.
Rooted in their defense as a child
against a cold and unsympathetic parent.
It's textbook.
- Okay, somebody say it, please.
- You just described yourself, Lloyd.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You guys done playing grab-ass...
...or do you wanna
get your heads in the game? Thanks.
Charlie, it's tough for me to pin down
what her actual plan is.
It could be a quick tryst at a motel.
I doubt she settle down with another dupe...
...unless that dupe is the guy that is gonna
get her to the beach for that cocktail.
The time of purchase on the receipt
said 45 minutes ago.
She could be anywhere by now.
Maybe they hung around a bit
after they bought that stuff.
I tell you what, I'll just go back and ask.
Maybe not, Shea.
Lilah and the guy she was with
shopped at a couple stores down.
They bought 250 bucks in merchandise.
All clothing for a teen male.
For her son.
U.S. Marshals.
Must be happy hour.
What are you doing here?
We own this fugitive.
Not if she crosses state lines to see her kid,
in which case, we'll take the collar.
- The question is, what you doing here?
- Working. What do you think?
Right. It's the "use a fugitive
to catch a fugitive" deal.
- I thought that was a bad rumor.
- We're here to talk to her son.
Lilah was recently buying clothes
for a teenage boy.
Yeah, well.... Ah, ah.
The kid has not been in contact with Lilah,
if that's what you're here for.
- You could have called and found out.
- No offense, but we'll ask ourselves.
And you might wanna lower that hand
or I can lower it for you.
Foster parents' names
are Derek and Kitty.
Thank you.
Wow, what a crew.
That's a whole lot of bluster there.
You sure you're not overcompensating
for something?
You wanna find out?
Mm, mm, mm.
How often do you see your mom, Taylor?
Once a year, on her birthday.
- Phone calls?
- Once a year, on my birthday.
We've told Lilah she's welcome
to call as much as she wants, but....
- You been in contact with her recently?
- No. But we recently moved...
...to terminate Lilah's parental rights
and officially adopt Taylor.
You think that could've been the trigger
to make her wanna escape?
- It's hard to say.
- Of course, it's the trigger.
It's about winning and losing
with this woman.
- And I guarantee you--
- We get it, Lloyd.
Taylor, your mom
might try to contact you.
If she does, I'll let you know,
just as long as you don't hurt her.
- We promise.
- We'll try our best.
Folks, if it's okay, I'd like
to talk to Taylor in private. Sorry.
There's a phenomenon
known as the attachment theory...
...which is what it sounds like.
I can't believe the guy got published...
...coining a term that self-evident.
But the point is that children...
...can forgive and look past a lot
when it comes to their parent...
...even if that parent
is a very, very imbalanced mother.
- How old are you?
- Fourteen.
When I was your age...
...my mother used to duct tape oven mitts
to my hands to keep me from masturbating...
...which was such a violation,
and it didn't work, by the way...
...and I started to harbor
a lot of resentment.
Yet here I am
still making excuses for her.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I don't believe you when you say
you'll notify us if your mom contacts you.
Hey, I empathize.
But you have to know there's a price
you pay for covering for an unfit mom:
It's your own self-worth.
You seem like a well-adjusted young man
with good moral development.
Don't let your mom wring that out of you
because of her mistakes, okay?
Here's my cell number,
if you wanna talk.
The original
Nice.
I've been there, okay?
LILAH: Oh, my God, it's so good
to finally see you, Jeff.
Dreams really do come true. Ha, ha.
I got a call from someone
with the U.S. Marshals.
They want me to come in to talk.
Well, we expected that, right?
Just tell them you visited me in prison
and that's it.
Do you have everything, baby?
I don't understand why you need all this
when you could stay with me.
Well, I am gonna stay with you, baby,
for the rest of my life.
First, I need to take care of a few things.
JEFF:
I'm gonna need the car back tomorrow.
I'm gonna need it longer than that.
I really need it back tomorrow,
sweetheart.
- Do you want me to get caught, Jeff?
- It's just--
- Do you?
- Of course not.
It sure as hell sounds like it.
When I do, maybe I'll have to tell the cops
that you provided these things to me.
- Do you want that?
- No.
Well, quit trying to ruin everything.
You'll see me when you see me.
I'm warning you
that I will not lie to the police...
- ...so when they do talk to me--
- Wrong answer.
Please, no. No.
Good afternoon.
Afternoon.
These were five of Lilah's repeat visitors
in prison the last two months.
I have calls in to four others,
but no word back yet.
Turns out
Lilah was an active pen pal-er.
Trait of the manipulative narcissist:
They love getting things over on people.
- Did we get the mug shot out?
JULIANNE: Yes.
- Missing anything?
- Yes.
Uh, yes, it is out.
No word on "missing anything."
RAY: Milt Langley?
- Yeah.
RAY:
Follow us.
LLOYD:
What do we have here?
A little rebel fetish, you guys, huh?
A bunch of dream lovers using fantasy
projection to wish away reality?
Grabbing the chance
to control a relationship...
...because the inmate needs you more.
- Sound about right, maybe?
SHEA: Ahem.
- Leave them alone.
- Ah, they're fine.
It's not just pen pal-ers.
Same dynamic and attributes...
...apply to all the millions of losers in chat
rooms around the world. It's very common.
She should never have been
in prison to begin with.
Her jerk of a husband was abusive...
...and Lilah was a battered woman
who got out the only way she knew how.
By stabbing him 48 times?
Looks like she's good
for the body we found in the park...
...another one of the schmucks
who loved her.
Or her first husband,
who she turned into a crisp one night?
Come on, man, wake up.
- When was the last time you saw her?
- Two weeks ago.
She broke up with me,
for no reason.
- She didn't try to contact you today?
- No.
I really thought we were in love.
CHARLIE:
- Okay.
- All right.
- Help you?
- Gabe Prescott.
I got a call to report here.
That's right. This way, Gabe.
Gabe, let's go.
Rebel fetish isn't the only fetish
that draws men to female inmates.
I think I need to listen to this interview.
CHARLIE: So, Gabe, how'd you know--?
- I'm not telling you anything.
- This guy don't wanna talk.
- I guess he's free to go, right?
Sit your ass down.
Were you with her
at the Valley Stream Mall today?
Perhaps I was. That's not a crime.
Did you take a photo of that guard's kid
and text it to her?
I took a photo of a kid.
I didn't know what she wanted it for.
And again, not a crime.
Okay, look, Gabe,
all we need is either Lilah's location...
...or the phone number
to the cell she has on her. That's it.
You give us that,
and you can leave right now.
Go back to your mother's basement where
you can go play air guitar or whatever.
I don't know where she is,
and you're never gonna find her.
- We want the cell phone number.
PRESCOTT:
He's defending Lilah out of
of Stockholm Syndrome...
...which indicates
she threatened his life at some point.
Wrong. Jules,
I gonna need to borrow a few things.
Listen, Gabe, do you really wanna play
Prince Valiant right now?
Aiding and abetting the escape
of a convicted felon...
...carries 10 years, mandatory.
She told me that she was released
on her own recognizance.
I had no reason not to believe her.
Naive? Maybe.
But not a crime.
You see those other guys
out there staring at the floor, Gabe?
They pen pal-ed with her too.
You got played.
I have nothing else to say to you.
Where is she?
ERICA:
Take a walk.
- Excuse me?
- Go.
- I'll tell you the same thing--
- Did I give you permission to speak?
- No.
- Then apologize.
ERICA:
PRESCOTT:
SHEA: Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.
We both know that one of the foundations
of a slave-mistress relationship is trust.
And discretion.
Lilah's prison jacket
has her listed at 5'2", 115 pounds?
There is no reason she would be buying
extra-large underwear...
...at that lingerie store, is there?
No.
So I am going to show discretion
and earn your trust...
...by not announcing
to my coworkers and yours...
...that you are currently wearing
a pair of pink, lace panties...
...under your jeans.
Do I get a thank-you for that?
- Thank you.
- Thank you, what?
Thank you...
...mistress.
RAY:
Get your hands out of your pockets, Lloyd.
ERICA:
They're dirty.
I detest dirty boots.
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
First things first.
CHARLIE:
Nice work, mistress.
ERICA:
That is Lilah's cell number.
Thanks for the loaner.
Oh, you can keep them.
Keep them.
- A half hour.
- Half hour?
How long does it take CPA
to trace phone activity?
Half hour.
She's already got 10 hours on us.
We're losing time.
What haven't we thought of?
Think outside the box.
We need a lead, Jules.
We need a lead. We need a lead.
Hey, Teresa.
Aw, thank you, baby.
Here now?
Tell me you have something, Ray.
Um, actually, that was my daughter.
She's downstairs.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, fine.
I just don't get to see her
as much as I'd like.
Her mom is a bit of a pill
when it comes to that.
So, um...
...I guess I gotta ask
if I could go down there for five minutes.
Of course, Ray. No sweat, man.
Mother, I am sorry, okay? Just....
There's a bunch of kisses for you.
Just call me back, okay?
Hey.
Hey, how did you read
that Prescott guy like that?
And just don't be coy, just tell me.
The pink undies peeking out of his pants
was a good start.
- Oh, yeah.
- But I can usually tell...
...what a guy's into, regardless.
- It's all in the eyes.
- Really?
- What am I into then?
- Mm.
Whatever you can get. You're desperate.
Yeah, you're good. You're really good.
So that guy in there...
- ...he's kind of like your beyotch right?
- Heh.
- I guess.
- Okay.
So how about
you get your classy chassis in there...
...and you command him
to give me 800 bucks.
- Your prison debt is not my problem.
- Erica, he is going to kill me.
Aw, stop being so dramatic.
What did he actually say?
- "I am going to kill you."
- That ain't good.
RAY: Hey.
- Tough man to get ahold of today.
RAY: Ah, how you doing, angel?
- Good.
RAY: It's good to see you.
- You too.
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.
Look at that.
Is your office doing anything special
for you today?
Yeah, they're blowing up balloons
as we speak.
- But it's going okay?
- Yeah, I'm working a case right now.
That's why I can't stay too long.
- So you're on track to be a marshal again?
- Maybe.
If the stars line up.
How long do you think
you'll be at the halfway house?
Hopefully, not too much longer.
- Why can't I visit you?
- Too many lowlifes.
- Why can't I at least see your office?
- Too many lowlifes.
Hey, come here, listen.
It's okay. Really.
I'm just trying to get it all back.
But sometimes I don't feel like
I deserve to get it back...
...with taking the money and all,
you know?
- But you do deserve it, Dad.
- No, all I know for sure is...
...I got you.
And believe me when I tell you,
that's all I give a damn about.
Charlie? Call history came in
on Lilah's phone.
- Anything?
- Uh, yeah.
You're not gonna believe
who she's been in contact with.
Oh, man.
Don't worry about that stuff.
What do you want?
Feedback came in on Lilah's cell phone.
We're heading there now.
- How's it going?
- Hi, I'm Teresa. Ray's daughter.
SHEA: Gotta go, Ray.
- Yeah, hold up a sec.
- Thank you for the cake.
- Okay.
- So I'll talk to you soon?
- Definitely.
Come here.
Don't ever do that.
I don't want cons around my family.
You left your cell on your desk
and Charlie--
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?
Whatever, boss.
- Where's the kid?
- He's upstairs taking a nap.
He's not feeling well.
What the hell is going on?
He's been in communication
with his mom.
Great. Good job, Stoltz.
She got what she wanted.
Now there's no move to anticipate.
Our job just got 10 times harder.
Kid wasn't under arrest.
We're protecting him.
- This is protecting him?
- You better take it down a peg.
- I only take heat from a real marshal.
CHARLIE: Enough.
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Half hour ago.
Let's go.
Thank you, Jules.
No signal on either phone.
She must have pulled out the batteries.
What do we already know?
Lilah used three guys
to get to where she is now.
If I had unlimited women on the outside,
I wouldn't stop using them.
She's got her son,
she needs to build a nest somewhere.
- Why not get some sucker to pay for it?
RAY: Is the kid in there, Lloyd?
LLOYD:
Just browsing.
RAY:
Lucas Harold, the go-kart guy,
uh, nothing from him.
Gabe Prescott,
the guy who licked my boots...
Hold on. Okay, the first guy
you interviewed, Milt Langley...
...he owns rental properties
throughout Jersey.
- Maybe him?
RAY:
He says she broke it off with him.
He seemed believable.
Maybe we were wrong.
Hey, baby.
My son, Taylor.
Taylor, say hi.
- Shake the man's hand.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- There you go. Ha-ha-ha.
- Did the police contact you?
- Uh--
- Yeah, U.S. Marshals did.
- And?
- I told them I didn't know where you were.
- Beautiful.
Now, baby, I need a huge favor.
We need to stay in one of your houses
for a few weeks. Some place real quiet.
- Lilah, you broke up with me.
- I know.
I needed you to be convincing
if the cops reached out.
Baby, I love you.
I would never wanna be away from you.
Didn't I say to you
that you had to trust me?
Didn't you swear to me that you would?
Look, I'll make it up to you, okay?
We'll do all those things
we talked about.
Lilah, I saw the other guys.
- The pen pals.
- Heh.
Did the marshals tell you that?
They were lying.
No. You lied to me.
- Mom, let's just go.
- Shut up.
Baby, I would never lie to you.
I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to leave.
We've got nowhere else to go, Milt.
Hey, I'm asking you to leave.
Okay? Just go.
Or I'll-- Or I'll call the cops.
Mom, please.
- Mom!
- You're gonna do what, Milt?
Mom, please.
Just put the gun down.
LILAH: You're gonna do what?
TAYLOR: Mom, no! No!
CHARLIE: Anything?
- No, just a flier for the WNBA.
SHEA:
Are you joking?
The WNBA is still around?
You can't be serious.
They've been around for 12 years.
Don't get the, uh, sports page in prison?
SHEA: Hey, good for them.
- I love the Washington Mystics.
SHEA: Yeah, you would.
- I do.
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah?
Another trait of the manipulative narcissist
is the inability to lose gracefully.
Her fantasy has collapsed, so she's lost.
She's coming unhinged.
RAY: Looks like a small caliber pistol.
Entry wound, no exit wound.
House is empty.
LLOYD: Hello.
TAYLOR:
- Taylor?
She's got a gun.
She's talking a lot of crazy stuff.
LLOYD: Where are you now?
- Some trailer park the guy she shot owns.
- Uh, what is she saying?
- Stuff like, "It's over."
Taylor?
I need you.
- Don't leave me alone.
- I gotta go.
Taylor, listen to me.
You need to get out of that house.
Your mother might be suicidal
and if you stay, you might get hurt as well.
LILAH:
Taylor.
Taylor.
Taylor, what are you doing?
Taylor. Taylor!
- I can't just leave her.
LILAH: Taylor!
CHARLIE:
Let's go.
All right, Langley owns 85.
- We gotta be real careful about this.
- The key is to get Lilah away from her son...
...so she doesn't have a chance
to take him out too.
When I did bounty work with my dad,
we did plenty of extractions in trailer parks.
I've got some ideas. We can go in first--
If it comes down to a negotiation,
do not let her see you lying.
A person with her disorder
can't stand being manipulated.
Did you just say "bounty work"?
- Please, just put the gun down.
- It's over.
They'll find his body.
There's no other way out.
There's always another way out.
CHARLIE :
Lilah, this is the U.S. Marshals.
I don't wanna be
separated from you again.
Do you wanna be separated from me?
- No.
- Then I have a plan.
Where we can both be together forever.
I have some good news.
Milt Langley survived the shooting.
He will not press charges.
Talk about the guard thing.
Eddie Vaughan admitted
that he helped you escape.
In exchange for your testimony
against him, you will not face charges.
Who do they think I am,
some dumb skank?
- Mom, just turn yourself in.
LILAH: You're lying to me!
- Mom, please.
LILAH: It's over.
- There's no other way out.
TAYLOR: Mom.
- You're lying to me!
- That is correct.
Gun!
RAY:
Put the gun down, lady.
CHARLIE: Lilah, you don't have to do this.
RAY: Put the gun down.
CHARLIE: Put the gun down, Lilah.
RAY: Don't be stupid.
CHARLIE:
Put the gun down.
- Lilah, don't do this.
TAYLOR: Mom.
CHARLIE: Lilah, no!
RAY: Put the gun down!
CHARLIE:
No!
TAYLOR: Mom.
LLOYD: She's gonna be all right, Taylor.
- Next time, call for backup.
- From you?
We wanted to prevent the situation
from going bad.
Did you help yourself
to anything inside?
- What?
- You know, check under the mattress.
Ray, not now.
You're having a lot of fun knowing
he can't hit you, right?
- Ugh.
- But I can.
The van.
I accept responsibility.
ERICA: Good. Good for you.
- What?
I accept responsibility
for my gambling problem.
But will you do me one favor?
When they find my body
shanked in a cell...
...will you please tell my mom
that I hate her?
- Will you do that for me?
- Sure.
No, don't tell her that.
Don't say that to her. Tell her....
Tell her I'm disappointed.
Yeah, tell her that I'm disappointed
in her choices. Okay?
Hey.
I'm, uh--I'm Erica Reed.
I may have been a little rude to you
the first time we met, and I apologize.
- Okay.
CHARLIE: Erica.
You should take some charm lessons
from her, Charlie.
We need you, Lloyd.
But if you ever get in debt again
and jeopardize my gig here...
...I will harvest one of your organs
with my thumbnail.
- This is worth, like, $400, max.
ERICA: Oh, my God.
It'll be enough.
CHARLIE:
Good night.
So that was Knox.
For once, the man's happy.
You happy, Ray? I'm happy.
Package for Ray Zancarelli?
"Zancanelli." Over here.
It's from my daughter.
Open it.
I'll wait for you in the car, man.
Do you remember what you told me
when I got kicked out of the academy?
You said if I didn't give up,
I could find my way back one day.
- How about we do it together, okay?
- Yeah.
Just remember, he has a lot of tattoos
and things, so be careful. Okay?
It's all up here, baby.
There.
My boy's debt with you?
It's off the books.
Ha, ha. Your boy, huh?
Well, tell your boy this covers half of it.
- There's an inconvenience fee applied.
SHEA: That's all of it, Tyler.
Watch.
Brownsville, Brooklyn.
Yeah.
I got your card, bitch.
You ever come around him again,
you'll be winding that with your tonsils.
This will be the last time
you look me in the eye around here.
That's what I thought.
LLOYD:
Holla.
