Those were the days.
Things you do

Problem was,

so anyone could be my dad.
One thing l was certain of,
l didn't have a white daddy.
And sure as hell, he wasn't a cop...
black or white.
Spent a lot of time
at my grandmother's.
That was a crowded house
with eight mouths to feed...
not including me.

Soon after that,
the dogs were heard barking.
And after that...

coming from the window.

''...my head with oiI,

Maybe even her killer.
''...mercy shaII foIIow me

After three hours,
l gave up my career as a rapper...
and went back to selling coke.
The thing about being a coke dealer
on the corner...
it was lousy pay.
And if you added up all the hours
and time spent waiting around...
it was like minimum wage.
And if you added in the time
you were likely to spend in prison...
it was less than minimum wage.
But then, one day...

Good.
Watch that shit.

Best friend
Girl, l'm gonna make you mine
Best friend

Sing some more.
First we get to talking
Then we get to touching

We'll be

Put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it, girl

Don't do it, pIease!
PIease don't fucking do it!
Don't fucking do it!
Don't fucking.... Papa!
Oh, fuck!
-You okay?
-Drive.
...we were complicitous ,
as a country, in narcotics traffic...
at the same time
as we're spending countless dollars...
in this country to try to get rid
of this problem.
lt's mind-boggling.
What's up?
ln 1987, Oliver North was investigated...
for his role in a covert
money-for-arms operation.
You're aII right.
Breaking out.
It's time for bed, huh?
-What happened?
-Nothing.
Don't Iie to me.
You got bIood on your shoes.
Maybe this Iife isn't for me.
-Did you kiII him?
-No. I shouId've.
Men hide their emotions.
You bury yours, Marcus.
You're you and I'm me, CharIene.
The cops didn't find that gun
they came looking for.
They found something else instead.
-What's this?
-That's your shit.
My shit?
Why wouId I keep my shit here?
You're fucked, man.
Man, that shit ain't ours!
What the fuck, man!
Never seen him before.
Yeah, never seen him before.
AII right, y'aII, settIe down.
Listen up and pay attention.
My respect has been taken from me.
Who authorized the CoIombian hit?
AII right.
Without getting too bibIicaI and shit,
vioIence onIy begets more vioIence.
It does not beget more money...
which is the reason I thought we were
aII here in the first fucking pIace.
Now, I'm going away
for a short period of time...
to pay a poIiticaI debt
to our iIIustrious poIice department.
And whiIe I'm away,
I don't want no fucking drama...
on our streets...
about anything...
by anyone that's going to draw heat...
or attention to us in any way...
unIess you have my fucking permission.
Is there any nigga here
in PeIham HaII...
that is uncIear about
what the fuck I just said?
Good.
So now, for aII you
hearing-impaired motherfuckers...
whiIe Levar's down...
I'm number one.
So now, if you have any probIems...
come see me.
Marcus. Come here.
WeII, then...
my brothers.
Now, next time you have a probIem,
you come see me.
See, now you gonna have
to take the faII for this buIIshit.
-Cops, man, they pIanted that shit.
-No, they didn't.
We know who's doing what.
See, now be carefuI
who you Iet in your house.
'Cause someone cIose to you
is using.
Soap up.
Being reaI cheap on the soap.
And y'aII can turn the water up
a IittIe bit in here.
Yo, man! Guard!
Fight! We got a fight over here!
You saved my Iife.
Let's go.
Hmm-hmm.
This way. Keep going.
Why?
I don't know.
Looked Iike you needed saving.
What's your name?
Marcus.
Bama. Nice to meet you.
-Bama. You from AIabama?
-No, North CaroIina.
North CaroIina?
So why they caII you Bama?
I didn't want foIks caIIing me Lina.
Somebody wanted me to kill myself.
Thought about it.
Thought about my mother.
l was in a tomb, just like her...
and l had to find a way out.
l went forward...
made my mark.
lt was either express myself or die.
l know l did a lot of bad things
in my life...
but from that moment on...
l decided to tell the truth.
And l wasn't gonna back down.
Levar was not expecting
things to change.
DeaI with it, okay?
But after the shooting, he wasn't
gonna pay a little political debt.
He was gonna pay with his life.
Majestic set him up...
and blamed it all on Odell.
This nigga been working
for the CoIombians.
Betrayed Levar. Cost us money.
Now, how he gonna pay?
Let's pay him in diamonds and goId.
You right, motherfucker.
Them shiny-ass motherfucking teeth.
I can't trust you?
Are you working with the CoIombians?
Nigga, you the one set up Levar, nigga!
That was you who set up Levar, nigga!
Come on, man!
That was you that set up Levar!
Oh, shit.
Everybody reIax. We're aII friends here.
Levar fucked your bitch!
You got a Iot of mouth on you, OdeII.
Levar fucked your bitch, nigga!
-Yeah, babe?
-Levar fucked Katrina.
Majestic began his rise to the top...
and Dangerous crowned it all
with a song.
People got shot.
People disappeared.
And Majestic felt like
nobody could touch him.
Yeah, turn my music up.
Turn it up in my headphones
a little bit, son.
Yeah, we're gonna have to see.
What up? Yo, Majestic! You!
What up, baby?
Yeah. Yeah. lt's like this. Come on.
Niggas that pull their heat
And get shook, die on the streets
You can't look weak
Niggas'll lay you down six feet
And when you lay down
You keep an eye open when you sleep
We took the food out your belly, nigga
How you gonna eat?
You want me
You can find me on the block
See you in the morning.
And l will squeeze off rounds and watch
them slugs split your hairpiece
We run these streets
Where murderers and gangstas meet
Black skull, nigga
We pull the ice and gold
Straight out your teeth up in the NYC
Now you Iisten, gangster. Listen.
-Where's Majestic?
-No, man, no, man!
TeII Majestic we caIIed.
You know, I ain't never trusted foIks.
See, where I grew up...
there was a whoIe bunch...
of jeaIous cats.
They used to be mad
'cause I was Iight-skinned, you know?
They used to grab me after schooI
when I was in first grade and be Iike:
''Smack him and watch him turn red.''
So I got me a screwdriver and started
carrying that with me to schooI.
They ain't smack me no more.
-What's wrong with you, man?
-I just wanna kiII somebody.
-Who?
-Anybody.
There's a whoIe Iot of anybodies
in the worId, man.
You know,
I had this image in my head...
of Rick James kiIIing my mama.
I mean that.
I know Rick James ain't kiII my mama.
He just favored this dude named SIim,
you know.
WeII, what you got in your head now?
AII kinds of images.
lt usually goes down
over money and whores
But lil' homie, in my hood
When it rains it pours
This is real
Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow-tips and Talons
When it rains it pours
You caught in lead showers
Just because
Niggas ain't playin'
When it rains it pours
The Colombians hit back at Majestic
by cutting off his supply of drugs.
Eventually, just like Levar...
Majestic had to go
shake hands with Delgato.
But neither were happy about it.
One shot, one kill, what's the deal?
Yo, what's the deal?
Listen, lil' homie
When it rains it pours
Hollow-tips and Talons
When it rains it pours
You caught in lead showers
Just because
Niggas ain't playin'
When it rains it pours
Niggas get set up
'Cause when it rains it pours
End up wet up
'Cause when it rains it pours
What's up?
-You need a manager.

Thought I knew you.
But when I Iook at you,

I feeI sorry for your son.
He's just another IittIe bIack boy

I don't want him to see you Iike this.
What are you doing?

I can do without anything.
You can do without anything?

To get this cake

The combo to the safe

Damn, okay, we'll wait
'Cause you can pray for a miracle

My voice don't sound the same.

Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, l think l know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
ln the jewelry store
Looking at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
ln the dealership
Trying to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by
Summertime
White Porsche Carrera is milky
l'm on the grind
Let my paper stack when l'm filthy
lt's funny how niggas
Get to screw-facing at me
Anyhow, they ain't got
The heart to get at me
l'll get down
Southside's the hood that l come from
So l don't cruise through nobody hood
Without my gun
You know the kid
Ain't goin' for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, l'm a let off a full clip
Everybody mad
When their paper don't stack right
But when l come around
Y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down
You can hear the system thump
Nigga, when we rollin' rollin' rollin'
Shut your block down
Who's your daddy, boy? Huh?
Nigga, when we rollin' rollin' rollin'
Nigga, when we rollin' rollin' rollin'
Who's your daddy?
l think l know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by
You have to go back?
Yeah.
There's some things
I need the answers to.
I'd rather die Iike a man
than Iive Iike a coward.
Majestic reaIIy Ioved your mama.
One day he came to me and asked...
if there was anything
between me and your mother...
and I Iied to him.
l told him
l was only trying to protect her.
lt was far more than that.
Your mama didn't want
to take my family life from me...
but she gave me everything...
and I took it aII.
In the end, I didn't protect her.
Sometimes...
l feel like l killed her myself.
When I first saw you...
you was a IittIe baby.
I couIdn't even Iook you in the eye.
What you saying?
One night, after midnight...
l was sitting here.
Word came through that you was gone.
You was dead.
For the first time in my fucking Iife,
I feII to my knees...
and I prayed to God
that nothing happened.
So I prayed to your mama.
I asked her to forgive me...
and to taIk to God for me
to bring you back.
l don't deserve you.
Rocks that l copped
From proceeds from the spot
l got the energy to win
l'm full of adrenaline
Play the curve and get nauseous
Watchin' the spinner spin
l made plans to make it
A prisoner of the state
Now l can invite your ass
out to my estate
Them hollow-tips bent me up
But l'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender
Make a protein shake
He's coming, y'all.
Our own Young Caesar
is coming back to Pelham Hall...
July 4, 8:00 p.m. Be there.
l want the finer things in my life
So l hustle
Nigga, you gettin' in my way
When l'm tryin' to get mine
And l'll buck you
l don't care who you run with
Or where you from
Nigga, fuck you
l want the finer things in my life
So l hustle
l don't know shit about gymnastics
l somersault bricks
Black Talons start flyin'
When a nigga flip
Yo, nigga, you gotta
turn this shit the fuck off.
What you want me to do?
I got this man in the back.
-Stop the crack!
-We don't want no more!
-Stop the crack!
-Give us back our street!
Papi, do you have any controI
over your neighborhood?
Don't fucking worry about nothing,
aII right?
-You gonna Iet him pIay this concert?
-You worry too much, Mira.
Man, Iisten to this.
-Stop the crack!
-Give us back our neighborhood!
Stop the crack! Stop the crack!
Does he have to do this?
I think he does.
Antwan. Remember,
you keep him covered, aII right?
AII right.
So what's happening, man?
Bye, Nana.
Last time I saw your mother, she was
saying goodbye in that front room.
You Ieave enough protection here?
Yeah, y'aII gonna be aII right. Yeah.
This one is IegaIIy owned.
If it comes down to it,
I got a knife in that drawer.
That's aII I know.
That's aII any mother knows.
I'II be okay, Nana.
You can't take that from a person,
being a protector.
That's aII any man or woman is at
the end of the day anyway...
That's aII any man or woman is at
the end of the day anyway...
is a protector.
Protector of a chiId
who wiII one day die.
Marcus...
when I Iook in your eyes,
I don't know what you thinking.
And you've been Iike that
since you were 12...
since the day your mama died.
-I'II be okay.
-No...

I Iove you, Nana.
Yo, it's soId out!

You reaIIy wanna go through with this?
You wanna go out there

In front of my own peopIe?
You know I can't Iet you do that, Marcus.
Here's what I can do.
I'II Iet you come out there,

-Show some respect.

He said no.

Start the fucking show! Start the show!
-Get back, man.
-I Ioved her, man.
I didn't mean to hurt her, man.

Man...
I Iove you, man. I Iove you.
Let's do this.
I can't Iet you go out there, nigga!
I can't fucking Iet you go out there!
You kiII me, Marcus. Come on, man.
You do it.
Come on.
l been looking for my father all my life.
l realized l was looking for myself.
l felt like l was walking away
from the old me...
and the new me was being born.
lt's Young Caesar!
What's up?
America got a thing
For this gangsta shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skullies
Leather Pelle Pelle
l take spit over Raymo shit
l'm a fan
l take spit over Raymo shit
l'm a fan
Got the silver duct tape
On my .38 handle
The women in my life
Bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in New Jack
l holler "cancel that bitch"
Look at me, this is the life l chose
Niggas around me so cold
Man, my heart done froze
l build an empire on the low,
the narcs don't know
l'm a weatherman, l take that coca leaf
And make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope
Watch it go out the door
O after O, you know
Homie, l'm just triple beam dreamin'
Niggas be schemin'
l fiend to live the good life
The fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat
So you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out
The question for me
l want the finer things in my life
So l hustle
Nigga, you get in my way
When l'm tryin' to get mine
And l'll buck you
l don't care who you run with
Or where you from
Nigga, fuck you
l want the finer things in my life
So l hustle
lts a hustler's ambition
Close your eyes, listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
And drama means nothin'
lt's part of the game
Catch me in the coupe, switchin' lanes
Or in the jeweler's, switchin' chains
l upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS
Rocks that l copped
From proceeds from the spot
l got the energy to win
l'm full of adrenaline
Play the curve and get nauseous
Watchin' the spinner spin
l made plans to make it
A prisoner of the state
Now l can invite your ass
out to my estate
Them hollow-tips bent me up
But l'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender
And make a protein shake
l'm like the East Coast's
number one playboy, B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you
He ain't got shit on me
The Feds watching me
lcy, they can't stop me
Racist pointing at me:
"Look at Niggerace." Hello!
l want the finer things in my life
So l hustle
Nigga, you get in my way
When l'm tryin' to get mine
And l'll buck you
l don't care who you run with
Or where you from
Nigga, fuck you
l want the finer things in my life
So l hustle
