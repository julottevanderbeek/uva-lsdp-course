- Don't lie to me.
- Mom!
Happy birthday, Henry!
Mwah!
We have to be able
to trust each other.
I know.
I'm sorry.
And Amelia?
- Oh, my God. No.
- Yes.
Most of our mother/daughter
time is spent
cooking for the bake sales and
then there's boys, boys, boys.
Nothing much else to worry
about with these kids.
Nothing prepares you
for them growing up.
My agent called the service.
The surveillance tightened.
He can't do a dead drop.
I've got him coming here
to do a pass. It can't be me.
He's gonna be looking for a blue
hat and an 11-year-old boy.
We don't use our kids.
He's in gray pants, gray blazer,
green tie with white pattern.
Emmett?
- Paige and Henry. Go.
-
I should have done it
without Henry.
You're supposed to be
with Martha tonight.
- No, no, I'm gonna make an excuse.
- No.
If the FBI were part of this,
if they knew about this,
we need to find out.
Elizabeth:
Who would do this?
You want the list?
Someone who knows us,
every single one of us,
someone who is onto
the operation.
Woman: 2, 7
Paige: Mom, we're up!
Get the oranges out!
Paige: All right.
Henry: Paige, come on.
You're so annoying.
Come on!
Get those oranges.
Man:
Have a great day.
Woman: Mike,
you forgot your backpack!
Man:
Oh, this looks fabulous.
You okay?
I'm not feeling so great.
So don't push it.
Take a sick day.
I got a lot to do today.
They're lucky to have you.
You know, I saw
in the Bureau newsletter
that there's a senior clerk
position opening up.
What department?
Um, Office of Equal
Employment Opportunity?
Yeah.
You know, secretaries
usually top out at GS-7.
Senior clerks,
they go all the way to GS-9.
Well, are there any clerk
openings in Counterintelligence?
Mm, no.
Not right now.
You should talk to Personnel,
put in an application
so you're top of the list the
next time one opens up there.
Well, sure, but...
this one's open
Martha, you're smart,
you're capable,
you're working in a department
that does important work.
I mean, don't you want to stay
and rise up somewhere
where you can make
a difference?
Hmm...
Woman:
Agent Gaad would be lucky
to have me as a clerk.
- Yeah.
- Oh. Oh, this is awful.
A family was murdered in their
hotel room in Alexandria.
The parents and their daughter.
- Good lord.
Now, you think
this was a burglary
or some
Charles Manson-type thing?
Martha, it's not
a Charles Manson thing.
Okay.
Have a safe flight, hon.
Love you!
Love you, too.
They were killed in a hotel
right near Old Town Alexandria.
We were probably like a few
blocks away when it happened.
God, turn that off.
But it's the news.
Woman:
Jamie, Bob, let's go.
Come on!

I don't think so, but--
Good morning, Mr. Philip.
Morning, Stavos.
Um, I need to talk
to you about--
Can you give me five minutes?
And I will be all yours.
- What did Moscow say?
- I didn't get the signal.
The kids were up. I didn't
want to leave them downstairs.
- Okay.
- Martha?
Hour and a half in Gaad's office
on the tape,
but not a word
about the murders.
They're not on it at FBI.
They do not know
who Emmett and Leanne are.
Let's just see
what Moscow knows.
You want to make the drop?
Get out on the street a little?
I can listen on the numbers.
- Come in!
- Hey.
Stan!
Hey, sorry to barge in
like this.
Is this a bad moment?
No.
Are you kidding?
Never.
Oh, great.
Great.
- How are you?
- Good, good.
I brought some friends with me.
Oh, great.
Uh, this is Mike Orndorff.
Mike.
- And this is Stuart Batlet.
- Hi.
Mike works down the hall
from me,
and Stuart's
his brother-in-law.
He's getting married
to a very lovely young lady
named Sarah.
Oh, great.
Second marriage.
Gonna do it right this time.
Yeah. Great. Right.
So, we need a bachelor weekend.
March 12th to 14th.
Something that's not gonna
wreck the marriage.
Okay. Budget?
Oh, Stuart owns his own
plumbing business.
Very successful.
Maybe Montreal.
I mean, it can be a little cold
that time of year,
but it's very European
and it's only a two-hour flight.
Uh...
Or, uh, there's that great,
uh, dude ranch in Kentucky.
We sent some guys there
last year.
You know, horseback riding,
trout fishing, dove hunting.
They brew their own moonshine.
I told you.
This is the guy.
Let me, uh--
let me show you a brochure.
My mother has that same clock
in her kitchen.
- Really?
- Yeah.

Child: Mom, look at me!
I got the signal.
Chesapeake. Tonight.
They want us to check out
Emmett's agent.
Do they think he did it?
I don't know.
I don't think  know.
If Emmett's agent turned,
they definitely had someone
watching the brush pass
in Alexandria.
that happened,
they would have gotten us
by now.
Or not.
Either way, we still have
to check out this guy.
You go.
I'm gonna stay with the kids.
Okay, good.
Good.
Gaad:
one of his diplomats got shot
in the back of the head.
Stan:
I can't really give answers.

I just think the teachers
should communicate
so if Miss Bell gives us
a math test on Thursday
Mr. Abernathy doesn't give us
a history test the same day
because you can't study
enough for both.
- Right.
- You don't learn anything.
And you get bad grades
and you just don't feel good.
Right.
Dad, do you really have to go?
new agencies have opened
up in the last month.
And the one around the corner
is offering inclusive packages.
What's inclusive packages?
It's where they give you all
your food, airfare, hotel.
You just pay once
and then you forget about it.
Problem is, we have to figure
out a way to keep up.
We could be wiped out.
Would it help
if we came to work
with you on the weekends?
No, it's not that bad.
No, he's exaggerating.
Come here.
But I do have to travel more,
you know?
Make friends
with the hotel managers,
figure out a way we can be
better than the competition.
So, I will see you...
in a couple days.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye, team!
Bye, dad!
Let's go.
Okay.
Mom, come on.
Coming.
Mr. Dameran, I'm very sorry
W-well, then
speak to me in person.
Look, I put my life on the line
to get here.
I understand completely.
And we're very grateful
you have come.
Just, we have...
I have to be at work
in 25 minutes.
You get somebody in here
or I'll leave.
You're absolutely right.
I'm taking care of it now.
_
_
Some of these,
uh, frustrations,
despite our numerous efforts,
have not been solved yet.
Yeah, look...
I want to do something
really important for the cause,
but if I'm caught coming in
or out of the embassy, it'll...
Mr. Dameran, I understand
if you cannot wait.
Just maybe...
you want to tell me
a little bit now
about who you are
and what you can do for us.
_
Guard:
Can I see some ID?
How's it going?
Any luck on the contracts?
So far, nothing,
but I'm just getting started.
How are the kids?
I'm about to pick them up.
Yeah,
better than the bus today.
Good.
Bye, hon.
I'll talk to you later.
I almost gave up on you.
We have a walk-in.
What do you know about it?
I'm not on the team
handling it.
I haven't heard much.
Well, do you know what time
he came in?
No.
Well, when was the first time
you heard somebody
talking about it?
About 11:00?
Well, tell me
about Arkady's movements.
He's in and out of his office
all day, very busy.
After 11:00?
Yes.
Until about... 2:00.
He was in there
a very long time.
You see any cables going out?
There are always cables.
Anything high-priority?
No, I wasn't
close enough to see.
I'm sorry I don't have more.
Well, this is good.
This is very good.
I got to get on it.
Your report can wait an hour.
Come here.
Fred:
So, he's not in?
Well, can I leave him
a message, then?
Tell him I really enjoyed
our dinner.
The steak was excellent.
Did you get that?
I  enjoyed our dinner.
The steak was
Okay.
Thanks.
Fred, um, we need to talk.
I'm a friend of Paul's.
You're, uh, you're doing great.
You just sent him
an emergency signal,
and now you're on
your escape plan.
You probably think I'm FBI
or DOD
or Lockheed Security or CIA.
I know you feared this day
would come.
Paul warned you, prepared you,
probably, and rigged
that box for you.
But this is
something different.
Nobody has caught you.
Fred, listen to me.
Listen to me.
We've met before.
In Old Town Alexandria.
You were supposed to hand
something to Paul,
but he couldn't do it,
so you handed it to me.
I looked different then,
but look close.
It's me.
Man in a blue baseball cap
with a boy.
How could  know that?
I can think of a lot of ways.
Paige: Okay.
I'll take the
automobile insurance.
Mm-hmm.
Can I go watch TV?
I'm almost at retirement!
He always wants to watch TV
when he's behind.
Maybe I'm just
a little bit more interested
in real life than the game.
Yeah, real life--
watching TV.
Hello?
Henry:
Mom, it's your turn!
Hang on. I have to take
a message for dad.
Mom!
I'm bored!
You know what?
You guys want to go see a movie?
Yeah.
We could go see
"Raiders Of The Lost Ark."
Cool.
If we left right now,
we could make the next show.
I thought we're having
family time.
You'd rather play "Life"
than watch
"Raiders Of The Lost Ark"?
Are you insane?
We could have family time
at the movie.
You guys, come on.
Go get your coats!
Quick, quick, quick.
Fred, you have to
untie my hands.
I still don't know who you are.
You  know who I am.
I have told you who I am,
and we do not have much time.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry I have to do this.
Those model--
the model kits,
those model kits that you have
in your closet.
They were gifts for his son,
weren't they?
Weren't they?
We don't usually tell people
about our kids,
so you must really mean
a lot to him.
It is okay, Fred.
Fred, it's okay.
You know it's the truth.
We're both his friends.
I'm-- I'm gonna meet him.
I'll tell him about you,
and then we'll see
what he wants to do.
You can't.
Why?
Is there any chance
that you told somebody
about your relationship
with Paul
or that they guessed
by accident?
Even the littlest of--
I know. I  you would never
betray him on purpose.
I know that. But is there
any chance someone found out?
Why are you asking me this?
Because it's important.
No. Of course not.
Why did your surveillance
tighten up on your in DC?
They tightened up on everybody
at the meetings.
They're paranoid!
Now tell me what the hell
is going on!
I believe you.
I do.
I-I-I see all that money
in your bag.
You didn't spend a penny.
You didn't do it for the money.
You did it for something much
bigger just like Paul said.
I understand why
he trusted you.
I do.
Fred, I have to
tell you something,
and it is gonna be hard.
Did you see the story about
the couple that was murdered
in a hotel room
in Old Town Alexandria?
- With their daughter.
- Yes.
That was Paul.
No, it wasn't.
I saw the picture in the paper.
No, you only ever saw him
in disguise
like I'm wearing now,
for your own protection.
Why...
Why are you saying this?
Because it's the truth
and you need to know.
Oh, God.
Damn it.
You guys, I forgot.
I-I promised dad I'd finish
ticketing this tour package
we have to get out
by tomorrow morning.
I'm gonna have to drop you guys
off at the movie.
Y-you're not coming with us?
You missed the turn, mom.
I'll circle back around.
I'll get there
as soon as I can, guys.
What was his real name?
Emmett.
He didn't really take
to a lot of people.
For him, you had to see
the world the way it really is.
We talked about that a lot.
Most people live their lives,
punch their clock,
but they never do anything,
accomplish anything.
I know.
His wife and his daughter...
And that poor son
left all alone.
All that money,
I want to give it to him.
We can't, but...
he'll be taken care of.
That boy you were with
in Alexandria,
was that your son?
I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.
But, um...
- I'll be in touch.
- Did you get the settings?
Can your people build off them?
What settings?
On the machine.
The information I gave you
in Alexandria.
E-everything's been on hold
because of what happened.
It  be on hold.
The plant where they're grinding
the propellers is moving.
It's the one chance
to get in there
and read the settings
on the machine.
Hey, hey, hey.
Spare some change?
Hey. Hey, mama.
Where you going?
Who are you?
Who are
I need help.
Did you come to help me?
Those are not the words
I'm looking for.
Uh, fixing my car!
I need-- I need help
fixing my car.
Keep trying.
Ma'am, did you come to help me
fix my car tonight?
Yes. I heard you had a
breakdown, and I came to help.
I was--
I was out with him.
He said,
"Do you want to have fun?"
Give me the gun.
He brought me here
to-- to take drugs.
I-I don't--
I don't know what to--
Um, I don't know what to do.
I can't--
I can't think.
It's okay. I'm here.
It's okay.
Well, good news.
He's not dead.
What's your relationship
with him?
He's a congressional aide.
He works for a congressman
on... the...
Intelligence Committee
- overseeing Central America.
- Who does he think  are?
Um, a graduate student
in political science...
from Costa Rica.
I can't breathe.
I can't-- I can't breathe.
Do you know what you took?
Uh... we smoked cocaine,
and I took pills.
You're gonna be okay.
Look at me.
How long have you been here?
In the US?
- Two months.
- You're doing fine.
Things can go wrong.
They usually do.
It's part of the job.
But we get through it.
You'll get through this.
I want you to sit here
and I want you to watch him.
- Can you do that?
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.
W-where are you going?
I'm gonna buy you something.
I'll be back soon.
Who's the next one?
Gregorenko.
That's him.
What time did he go in?
Is this the last one we got?
- Yep.
- Where are we?
Uh, we started with the
surveillance photos at 10:00 AM,
an hour before the source
first heard anything,
and worked our way
to 2:00 PM
when they said
things settled down.
We got everybody going in
and out of the Soviet embassy
between those hours
and eliminated the people
we know who work there.
These are the four
that are left.
One of them
should be the walk-in.
Last guy walked in
to the Soviet embassy
gave them the trigger designs
they use on all their nukes.
Let's figure out
who this guy is
before Brezhnev starts building
his own space shuttle.
Drink.
All of it.
When he wakes up,
tell him you saved his life.
And by not taking him
to the hospital,
you saved his future.
He probably wants to be
a senator, right?
Probably.
Eat those.
Don't party with him anymore.
Be his girlfriend.
Thank you.
I wish I could stay with you,
but I have to go.
You're gonna be okay.
Your Revolution is beautiful,
the foothold for us
in Central America.
We're here to help you.
Call anytime.
What do you got?
Three of our four are out.
Two were fixing the AC
at the embassy,
one was bringing lunch.
Tell me you got a name
on this guy.
Bruce Dameran.
Born Reno, Nevada.
Purple Heart in Vietnam.
Seven years employed
Department Of Agriculture.
Currently employed World Bank.
Well, that's a nice spot
for the Soviets to get a source.
Bring him in?
Not yet.

Elizabeth: Any news?
Philip:
Yeah, I talked to him.
You what?
It's a long story,
but he didn't do anything.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Good.
So, Martha has 102.
Um... you should probably
go over there.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I-I'll talk to you
when you get home.
Okay. Bye.
_
Nina: We had a walk-in.
Well, tell me about
Arkady's movements.
Your report can wait an hour.
_
_
_
_
Arkady: Da?
Martha:
Hello?
How are you feeling?
Ugh, I don't know
what happened.
It wasn't like this yesterday,
but then it just hit me.
Anyway, um, guess what.
I-I talked
to Personnel today,
and even though there aren't any
clerk openings
in Counterintelligence
right now,
they gave me an application
to fill out.
So if something opens up,
I will be on the list.
That's great.
Listen.
Oh, you're not
gonna believe this.
My flight got canceled.
Ohh!
Oh, no.
Yeah, I'm stuck in
a Howard Johnson's in Boston.
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to bring you soup.
That's sweet.
Well, don't worry about it,
I guess.
Get some rest.
I will.
And you, uh,
you feel better, honey.
Clark, um...
everybody has been talking
about those murders.
Yep.
Agent Brooks says that crime
is at an all-time high
and that it's only gonna
get worse in DC.
I think women should be able
to protect themselves.
Things like that
are really rare.
I'm gonna get a gun.
Martha.
Clark!
I don't want to be a victim.
Hello, operator?
Could I get the area code
for Cresson, Pennsylvania?
Hi.
I'm looking for the phone number
and address for Helen Leavis.
Hi, everybody!
I'm home!
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, dad.
How are you?
- You're home.
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I, uh, heard your voice
on the phone,
so I thought I'd drive
straight through.
Good night.
Good night.
You okay?
Yeah.
What are you gonna tell
the kids?
Lava.
I signaled the Centre.
It will be tomorrow
if they want us to go.
I keep thinking
about their son.
I saw him...
walking back to the room...
when I was leaving.
I heard him screaming.
What's gonna happen to him now?
Centre will make sure he's...
- taken care of.
- Taken care of how?
Yeah.
Philip, all these years,
I... I never worried
about Paige and Henry
being safe.
What happened
to Emmett and Leanne,
I always knew that was a risk.
But seeing Amelia...
I mean, how are we gonna live
like this?
We'll get used to it.
Like we got used
to everything else.
I can't believe I pulled Henry
into that--
I... I pulled him into
You didn't have a choice.
Yeah.
I did.
