- Don't answer it.
- I have to. It's football season.
Oh, come on. There is no game tonight.
- Paulie, what's up?
- Forget that.
- I was making cheese dogs for you.
- Why, what's going on?
Okay.
All right.
I'll be there.
Chrissy!
It was a bitch getting off work.
- Adriana, I think this could be it.
- What?
He told me to meet him at Modell's.
He told me to shine my shoes.
Oh, my God. Christopher!
Find a matching shirt and tie.
Not the camellia. Paulie has one.
I can't believe it. I mean,
I knew it would happen, but...
So now can we get out of here?
Get a big loft, maybe?
- You're giving notice today.
- You wish.
The wife of a made guy
doesn't hostess.
I'm so proud of you.
- I love you, Christopher.
- You better.
- What?
- I don't know.
You getting called like this and going
off all happy. I worry, that's all.
You've seen too many movies.
- How you doing, kid?
CHRISTOPHER: Good.
No, no, no. Ride up front.
Where we going?
You look good. Shoot your cuffs.
CHRISTOPHER:
Where we going, Sil?
Here he is.
So this is it.
All right.
He sat on one ass cheek
the whole way over!
- Too many movies, is his problem.
- I didn't sit funny.
All right. Let's get started. Come on.
PAULIE:
All right, finish up over there.
You know why we're here.
So if you've got any doubts
or reservations, say so.
No one will think any less of you.
Because once you enter this family,
there's no getting out.
This family comes before
everything else. Everything.
Before your wife, your children,
your mother and your father.
It's a thing of honor.
If something happens
and you can't earn...
...we'll take care of you.
That's part of it.
If you got a problem,
you just gotta let somebody know.
This man right here,
he's like your father.
No matter if it's with somebody here
or outside...
...you bring it to him,
he'll solve it.
You stay within the family.
All right, give me your hand.
Okay.
That's St. Peter, my family saint.
As the card burns...
...so may your soul, if you
betray your friends in the family.
Now rub your hands together like this
and repeat after me.
- May I burn in hell...
- May I burn in hell...
...if I betray my friends.
...if I betray my friends.
Congratulations.
PAULIE:
Family.
Beautiful.
- My heart's pounding.
- You done good with the sports book.
- Yeah, it's been good.
- I'm gonna give it to you. It's yours.
- I was wondering what it was gonna be.
- You're a made guy now.
It's your turn to make real money,
and I get to relax.
Your only problem is to give me 10
points of the take each settle-up day.
Other than that, you got no problem.
My only problem in life? I gotta kick
my points to that man over there.
And onward goes this thing of ours.
When you think of all the
headaches people have...
...ours are boiled down to one.
Not a bad deal.
- You got it.
- There's a six-G minimum every week.
I gotta get something out of this.
Six grand could be a lot or a little.
Depends on you, and how
much you grow the business.
I love you, Paulie.
We're in it together now.
I love you too, kid.
Anything on the Newark
Riverfront Esplanade project?
My guy says the matching funds
are close.
They added plans for a Newark
Museum of Science and Trucking.
More cement. More everything.
Answer the fucking thing.
So you feeling okay?
You mean about my mother?
Well, what're you gonna do?
- You pick up the pieces and go on.
- I meant your spells.
They're not spells.
How do you know about that?
Everyone knows.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- Julius Caesar was an epileptic.
- I'm not epileptic.
Whatever it is, take care of yourself.
It's your health.
- Is the psychiatrist helping?
- You know about that?
There's no stigmata these days.
My kid saw one
for that thing with his wife.
- They're happy now.
- What about privacy?
Our family's done business a long time
with the Sopranos.
Peacefully and profitably. I wanna
keep it like that. Take care of this.
- All right, Carmine.
- Be a better friend to yourself.
I will.
I appreciate your concern. Really.
BENZA OVER TV: Jayne was determined
to "bust" into the business.
Hollywood folklore has it that she
called Paramount Pictures and said:
"My name's Jayne Mansfield
and I wanna be a movie star."
You got a phone call
from some young kid.
- Drew. Asked when you were going home.
- How'd he sound?
Like he was about 15 years old.
- Wait. Is that your so-called fiancé?
- He's 19, and he can go all night.
When are you going back to Seattle,
Janice?
It depends on how long it takes
to settle Ma's estate.
Estate? A falling-down house
and some old-lady underwear.
- Sad, isn't it? What it all comes to.
- You know how much we love you.
And you know we love
having you around.
But there's a big house over there.
And I know you want maximum value.
So for security, or so it don't fall
into disrepair, you could stay there.
I been thinking the same. I just
don't wanna push Svetlana out.
I talked to her. She's moving out
tomorrow, maybe the next day.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Great.
I better go pack.
Jesus Christ! Let me come around.
CHRISTOPHER:
How you doing, Roy?
Congratulations.
Large Old Blue Eyes for this
gentleman. Soft drinks of choice.
Look.
- Without Tony, he's a zero with shoes.
- He wears a stripe.
- My uncle Richie was gonna...
- Yeah, but he never did.
- Chris. My propers.
- Dino.
DINO:
Hey, Benny.
Congratulations.
- When did you get out, Benny?
- D.A. tossed it. Witness bailed.
- Jackie, how's Rutgers?
- Fuck it. I'm dropping out.
Come on. "Boola Boola."
We were talking about our former
school. They got the coffeehouse.
It's a pure cash operation.
The beauty part is...
...I mean, who's gonna stop you?
Kids? Campus security?
What are you telling him about that?
That's ours.
- Watch where the fuck you're going!
- Kiss my ass!
Take it outside!
Don't disrespect the pizza parlor.
- Asshole! I know where you live!
- You hear what I said?
Good talking to you, Chris.
Keep Dino in mind.
Not to be an asshole, but I can't
be seen in a place like this anymore.
TONY:
All right.
This has gotta start showing results,
or end.
I talked to a business associate
about these panic attacks.
Enough fucking around.
Enough money in your pocket.
What's the story here?
The latest treatment of Panic Attack
Syndrome is a three-part approach.
It's a syndrome?
Medication for depression,
psychotherapy...
...and cognitive behavioral therapy.
You're on medication.
If you feel ready, you could
see a behaviorist.
- You mean talk to somebody else?
- You seem unhappy with my approach.
If you're really ready to commit to
mental health, I say great.
Let's get going, I'm ready to help.
But we'll have to delve deeper. Focus.
This latest incident, for starters.
All right. Fine.
My daughter brought home a black.
They were on the couch, watching TV.
Snuggling.
And?
She went upstairs, and I had a
frank conversation with Buckwheat.
I told him to stay the fuck
away from my daughter.
And she came downstairs and they left.
Then you had the attack?
Not right then. I went to the kitchen
for a sandwich, opened the cabinet...
...I saw a box of Uncle Ben's rice.
Boom!
I see. The rice logo.
The first onset of hyperventilation,
that occurred upon seeing the rice?
Mmm...
No. I was taking the capocollo
and shit out of the fridge.
I'm thinking when you first came here,
the panic attacks with ducks...
...as I remember it,
you were grilling meat, weren't you?
The memory on you.
- Sausages, wasn't it?
- Sausages. Steaks. Yeah.
Wow. Let's get back
to that capocollo.
I gotta take that. My busy season.
Yeah?
Fifty?
That's pretty rich for one game.
If he's good for it, take it.
But keep me posted on
Duke-Wake Forest.
All right.
Sorry.
Where were we?
The connection between
your anxiety attacks and meat.
Right.
What was it again?
Closing Ohio State.
They're kicking off.
- Who you like? lowa?
- No difference, as long as it pays.
Chris, fuck. Oregon vs. USC?
I told you we should have
laid off some of that action.
Spread's 11. Oregon's down by 12,
they're on the 45, no timeouts.
Oregon's got an
All-American field-goal kicker.
Why didn't somebody tell me?
- See?
ANNOUNCER OVER TV: And it's good!
Forty-three yarder.
That spread could've opened at 18,
fucking top 10 team!
We should have laid off some.
Paulie did it all the time.
You see him here?
What's the matter with you people?
Answer the fucking phones!
- Minor setback, that's all.
- Oh, yeah?
- The frost is on the pumpkin.
- Supposed to warm up.
Good football weather.
Mom said she's waiting for the meat.
- Did Jackie Jr. show?
- I don't know.
- Little fuck promised he'd be here.
- Watch your mouth in front of my kid.
Probably keeping a booth warm
at the O.F., him and Dino Zerilli.
What's he doing? I told his father
I'd try to keep him out of this.
- He's the heir apparent.
- Not this kid.
Do me a favor.
Watch out for Jackie, okay?
You ought to turn that one link there.
Little setback, huh?
Ro, your kid's late.
It's rude, he should be set straight.
He'll be here. I paged him.
The poor kid lost his dad.
RALPH:
I lost mine when I was 6.
Ralph had to drop out of 11 th grade
to raise his siblings.
You'd never know it.
I'm Satan to this kid,
just because I'm in love with his mom.
- What are we talking about?
- The cheerleaders. Any hotties?
There's no cheerleaders
for freshman ball.
These are Mario Batali's string beans,
with Parmesan.
- You are very late, young man.
- It's me.
- Meadow! Hi, babe.
- Who is it?
- It's Meadow. What are you doing?
- Nothing. What's going on?
- Well, Sunday dinner.
- Yeah?
- Wanna talk to your dad? He's outside.
- Burning a cross?
I don't know what you mean,
but it's not the proper time.
- Your brother wants to talk to you.
- No, I don't.
- Hello?
- Hi. What's up?
- Everybody's here. It's boring.
ROSALIE: Is that Jackie?
It's not him.
It's Meadow, from school.
Hold on, call waiting. Hello?
- My mother there?
A. J: Yeah.
Aunt Ro? Yeah, I gotta go.
Thank you.
- Where are you?
- I can't make it.
- We're all waiting. You promised.
- Fuck it.
The way he talks to me...
I'll bring it up to Tony,
maybe he'll talk to him.
Paulie?
What time is it?
That's almost all of it. Warren
probably told you about Oregon-USC.
- This is unacceptable.
- It's $4000.
- I'll have the rest in a few days.
- I thought I made myself clear.
Fucking college ball.
But I learned a valuable lesson.
I'm not running a school, kid.
Paulie, this is me.
You know I'm good for it.
Don't drag in our friendship.
You work for me.
- I want to...
- Shut up and listen.
I'll give you a few days...
...but it'll cost another two G's
as a reminder not to fuck it up.
I make myself clear?
And don't give me the malocchio.
I'm not the one with the short bag.
Any word from your lvy Leaguer?
How's Carm with the empty nest?
Empty? Meadow's always home
with laundry or hauling food out.
All that talk, she didn't go far.
We created too nice a home life.
They don't want to go.
But if they're closer to us than we
were to our parents, is that bad?
- What time is it?
- I'm here, aren't I?
- Out of respect to my father.
- I gotta make two phone call.
Sit down.
- Want something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.
That's too bad. I said lunch meeting.
You want a drink?
Lose the glasses.
I'm gonna say a few things.
I'm gonna say some bad words,
and you're gonna have to deal with it.
I know what you think.
You think I clipped your uncle.
You'd be a shithead
to believe I didn't do it.
But I didn't.
And I got some bad news for you.
Look at me.
Look at me.
- Your uncle was a rat.
- No fucking way!
Sit down. Sit the fuck down.
He was a rat. He's in the
Witness Protection Program.
- That's my father's brother.
- I'm a member of your family, almost.
You think I'm the only one
that knows this about Richie?
You ask anybody. This hurt all of us.
Jesus Christ.
Your dad and me,
you know how close we were?
He never wanted this for you.
He wanted you to be a doctor.
Give me a fucking break.
Let me tell you something. Besides the
money, doctor's a powerful position.
I'm no doctor.
Know how hard you have to work
to get your MD? How many years?
I was thinking osteopathy,
but I don't have the grades for that.
You're not gonna drop out of Rutgers?
No. But those premed courses
almost killed me.
I only did it because my dad was sick.
But you should know
he never wanted this life for you.
And I'll tell you something.
I don't want it for my son, either.
MAN:
Hut!
Come on! Let's go, I wanna see
you hit them!
GOODWIN:
Get off the ball!
MAN:
Go, boys.
Fourth and three and this cetriolo is
going for it? With that offense?
Why's my kid still on the bench?
The coach will let him in.
They all get to play one quarter.
Pucillo in for Sposato!
Pucillo played already!
Put my kid in!
It's the rules.
MAN:
Hut!
CROWD: Yeah!
- I told you they wouldn't make it.
Are you fucking crazy, ref?
- Shh!
- What?
What did you say?
Come here and say it!
- Romano. The periodontist.
MAN: Get off the field!
ROMANO:
I'll rip your heart out!
- Look. Anthony's going in.
- All right, A.J.!
- Anthony!
MAN: Come on, baby, do it.
PLAYER:
Okay, defense, 41 stack.
- A.J.! Stick 'em, baby!
GEORGE: Stick 'em! Do it!
- Fumble!
- Fumble!
REFEREE:
Up! Up! Everybody up! Wait, get up.
It's A.J.! Yeah!
Yeah! Good job, A.J.!
Good job, good job. Yeah!
Hey! Hey!
That's my son.
MAN:
Take it off, guys. Let's go.
You got a nose for the ball,
and that can't be taught.
Ah.
But you gotta have leverage
and footwork.
I remember hitting that sled
till my shoulder was raw.
But then you reward yourself.
So I'll take you to Stewart's
and buy some dogs.
I just wanna go home.
You should be riding high
after what you did on the field.
Wanna play some Nintendo? You and me?
When are you gonna toss that
out the window?
- Why?
- Well, all right. Play Nintendo.
Okay, let's go to Stewart's.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
CARMELA: I need you home for dinner.
- Now? It's our busiest season.
- I know.
It's important that we not turn
into a family who eats at the counter.
All right. I'll be there.
Pass the potatoes, please.
Anthony? The potatoes?
- Sorry.
- Every night.
Go ahead. Pour yourself another glass.
You need good bones
for those open field tackles.
So.
How was everybody's day today?
Busy.
Nana was asking me where
you might want to go to college.
- I don't know.
- West Point.
- West Point?
- That's what you said.
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yeah, you did.
- You said Harvard or West Point.
- I'd never say that. I'd never get in.
- Can we eat with the TV on?
- No.
I gotta take that. My busy season.
- Yeah.
- Mom there?
Hey, how are you?
Is Mom there?
- Yeah, she's here. How's school?
- Fine.
Is Mom there?
- Is that Meadow? Can I talk?
- Yeah, you can have her.
A. J:
Hello?
Did you hear what happened
to Bobby Capodianco?
I don't know.
I feel bad. Taking your old room.
Don't worry about it.
You're all settled in.
You could sleep in your mother's room.
- Pass.
- Won't be for long.
Bill's children go to live with their
mother, end of week. I stay with him.
A few days is not a problem.
I'm glad I can help you out.
God knows my brother used to sleep
like a dead man in there.
I'm sorry about how I behaved
at the cemetery.
Janice. I cannot give records back.
I wish you'd reconsider.
I know Livia left no will,
but possession is 9/10 of law.
Let's not descend into that.
Feeling in me is,
she is not here to ask.
I know. I'm sorry.
This is an emotional issue for me.
I thought that if we
could talk one-on-one...
...I could make you understand
how much those records mean to me.
Just promise me you'll sleep on it.
It was that fucking bird
in the window!
It was a coincidence.
I was making good jack!
Now everything turns to shit?
The bird thing is if it's in the
house. And that's death, not bad luck.
- Will your mother loan me money?
- She's paying for her hysterectomy.
- Where's that bracelet I got you?
- Get rid of that stupid Range Rover!
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.
Jesus-fucking-Christ.
Janice! Janice! Janice!
Janice! Janice!
- The fuck is this? You owe me $300!
- I ain't using. Chris, I got mugged...
That's it! I want my money!
Fuck!
Ah!
- Janice call yet?
- No.
Hello, Tony.
- How have you been?
- What is she doing here?
She brings old leg.
Piece of shit, made in Russia.
I have losted weight,
cannot wear it no more.
Only an hour, then starts to hurt.
- I'm getting married. Did you know?
- You told me.
- Wish you all the best.
- She put into my Sprite three Halcyon.
I miss you so much, Tony.
Let's stick to the subject.
Your cousin's missing a leg.
$20,000. That's what it cost,
leg she took.
Flex foot, latest technology
with vertical shock pylon.
Plus, calfskin boot.
Kenneth Cole.
You don't even want to talk to me.
I don't see why we can't be friends.
I don't even know what I'm doing here,
except you worked it this way.
- We could have talked on the phone.
- I'm sorry, Tony.
It's not your fault.
Look, I'm sorry about your leg.
I'll reach Janice.
- Janice put any food in there?
- No, but I have orange juice.
Plus there are two Miller Genuines.
And your mother's meat delivery
still is coming every week.
ANNOUNCER OVER RADIO:
Southern California vs. Notre Dame.
We're in Indiana
on a perfect football afternoon.
SATRIALE: See you next week.
WOMAN: Thank you.
- I was just gonna call you, Johnny.
- Oh, yeah?
- Someplace we can talk in private?
- I'm kind of busy.
Gonna call.
Now you're busy.
SATRIALE: Something I could get you?
JUNIOR: No, I'm good.
It'll just take a minute.
Anthony, I told you
to wait in the car!
JUNIOR:
Listen to your old man, Anthony.
So, what were you gonna call me about?
I don't got it.
Ow!
Weasely son of a bitch!
Can't make payments?
See me. Work out a plan.
- I swear, a vendor owes me $300.
- Shut the fuck up!
Your wife's weekly order's ready.
It's gotta be $30 worth of meat there.
Capocollo, chops
and a standing roast.
You gonna backtalk me?
Junior, get him over here.
No, wait, please!
What are you gonna do?
Anthony, what did I fucking tell you?
What, your father never cut off
anybody's pinky?
That's traumatic for anyone
to witness, much less an 11 -year-old.
Actually, it wasn't.
It was a rush,
if you want to know the truth.
- You want me to delve?
- Go on.
Dinner's ready.
Come here.
Come on, I wanna talk to you.
What you seen today, Anthony,
a very sad thing.
You disobeyed your old man,
and I ought to give you the belt.
But I gotta say that...
...a lot of boys your age would have
run like a girl. But you stayed.
I know you like Mr. Satriale.
We all do. He's a lovely man.
The man is a gambler.
He got over his head in debt.
He owed me money and refused to pay.
He avoided me.
That's why you should never gamble,
Anthony.
What was I supposed to do?
That's my livelihood.
It's how I put food on the table.
- You should never gamble, Anthony.
YOUNG JANICE: Mom!
YOUNG LIVIA: Johnny, dinner's ready!
Anthony! Janice, turn that off.
Let this be a lesson to you.
A man honors his debts.
Beautiful cut he sent.
You like it standing
with the bone in, Lee?
Look at those juices.
All of me
Why not take all of me?
Can 't you see I'm no good?
Go, Wayne Newton.
Take my lips
I wanna lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
Can I have the end piece?
Johnny, let's eat
while it's still hot.
You bet, baby.
The lady loves her meat.
Four stitches. Ruined dinner.
- This was your first panic attack?
- Fainted, my old man called it.
Obviously, we've finally touched
on something here.
What you witnessed that day.
Where the meat came from.
And your mother's
great pleasure in it.
It was the one time
she'd be in a good mood...
...when the weekly delivery
from Satriale's came.
Or Fusco, the vegetable man, maybe.
Probably the only time
the old man got laid.
- Probably.
- Pretty sick, huh?
Getting turned on by free cold cuts?
Did your mother question
why the meat was free?
Meat that was going
into her children's mouths?
I don't know. I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna think about any of it.
I'm sure it was too much for you then
too. That's why you short-circuited.
Puberty. Witnessing not only your
mother and father's sexuality...
...but also the violence and blood
so closely connected...
...to the food you were about to eat.
And also, the thought that someday...
...you might be called upon
to bring home the bacon.
- Like your father.
- All this from a slice of capocollo?
Kind of like Proust's madeleines.
- What?
- Marcel Proust.
Wrote a seven-volume classic,
Remembrance of Things Past.
He took a bite of a madeleine.
It's a kind of tea cookie
he used to have as a child.
And that one bite unleashed a tide
of memories of his childhood...
...and ultimately of his entire life.
This sounds very gay.
I hope you're not saying that.
No.
Understanding root causes makes you
less vulnerable to future episodes.
My fucking head is swimming here.
We're gonna have to stop.
It's a lot to process.
But we've made real progress today.
Good work.
And I'd really like you to write down
any thoughts or associations.
ANNOUNCER: Looking across the middle...
TONY: See the left tackle?
He fakes inside,
and then gets a spin move on the guy.
Now he's charging the quarterback.
See?
- I thought the tailback had it.
- You gotta keep your eye on the ball.
- Okay, I'm going.
- Where?
I gotta bring Med her biking shoes,
she's been missing my braciole.
- Can I come?
- Hey, we're watching the game.
I can catch the game in the car.
It's nice he wants
to visit his sister.
- You're right. I'll get my shoes.
- Why not watch your game?
What, I shouldn't go now?
A.J., why don't you bring this stuff
out to the car?
This is about Sambo, right?
I'm paying for that goddamn college.
I don't know what's going on.
But if you want to make a scene...
...then comb your hair and come along.
Embarrass her.
Alienate her.
Or better yet, cut her off.
Let her drop out and go to a state
school. Or move back in here.
I was just trying to protect her from
herself. And I'll do that till I die.
I'm not gonna tell you you can't come.
She's your daughter.
I'll probably watch the game.
MAN 1: You got to throw the ball!
MAN 2: Let it rip!
ANNOUNCER: Garcia handing off
at the 40-yard line across to the 43.
I got your favorite
Santa Barbara olives.
Leave me the fuck alone.
Go for the touchdown. I need another
five points to cover the spread.
Hi. Pardon me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Here she is. Come on.
GIRL: It's just sort of a mess.
CARMELA: Meadow!
We're here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- This is my mom and my brother, A.J.
- Hey.
- Dad didn't come?
- No, he didn't. Did you want him to?
- Noah, would you mind?
- Noah told me what Dad said.
- It's out in the open, so fuck this.
- Let's watch the latrine-lip.
Oh, what'd Dad say?
Anthony, wait for me downstairs.
I want to talk to your sister.
- Oh, I know what he said.
- Go.
A. J: I'm always being sent away.
Why do I bother going anywhere?
- What did your father say?
- Like he didn't tell you.
- Believe what you like...
- He called Noah things so ugly...
...I can't even repeat it.
- You're right. There's no excuse.
- He's lucky I didn't punch him out.
Because you're civilized.
CARMELA: This was gonna
be a big drama?
You wanted your father
to subject your friend to this again?
Wait. So I'm in the wrong?
The rest of the world
should work around...
...his racist, retrograde,
fucking-asshole personality?
He's from a place and a time where
he thinks it's in your best interest.
New Jersey? The third millennium?
Noah, you know what I mean.
Coming from a racially-mixed marriage
must have been a burden.
Don't slam his background.
Look what you wound up in!
Excuse us, Noah.
I want a word with my daughter.
I'm not going anywhere
unless she wants me to.
It's okay.
I'll be up in a little while.
I'd hate to think you're airing
family business in public.
Noah's not stupid.
It took him a while, but he caught on.
He keeps his opinions to himself.
Unlike some people,
he's brilliant and sensitive.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
Anything I say to you,
or your father, will just fuel this.
I'm not gonna stop seeing Noah.
I put your helmet there. Though I'd
rather you not bike in the city.
If you must know, I'm going to
Litchfield, Connecticut...
...to the weekend home of Noah's
parents' friends, who work at NBC.
- but Hegel is talking about...
- Svetlana, get out here!
- Oh, hi.
You must be the famous Bill.
Moving day, huh?
I didn't think you would have
the nerve to show your face to me.
- Why? What's wrong?
- Don't bullshit me. Where is my leg?
- Your leg? Oh, yeah, where's your...?
- I know you took it.
That's preposterous.
How could I use it?
You think that will make me give
records back, but you're wrong.
If you see a karmic connection
between my mother's records...
...and your missing leg, wow!
The records return, and so does
the leg. I see how you got there.
How do you live with yourself?
Bill, don't waste breath.
This cunt is gonna be sorry
she ever fuck with me.
You better hope you have all your
shit, 'cause I'm calling the locksmith.
Doc. Where's Dino?
They got him for possession.
- Shit.
- What do you care?
He mentioned a job at Rutgers.
A coffeehouse.
Coffeehouse, shit. We were gonna
jack a benefit concert there tonight.
- Can you make it work without Dino?
- It was my fucking idea.
CARMELA:
I know this must be hard, Anthony.
Your sister off at college,
you all by yourself with us.
But it won't be for long.
Soon, you'll be heading
off to college yourself.
- I don't think I'm gonna go.
- College? Of course you will.
I don't wanna talk about it right now.
There's so many people, all smarter
than me. A bunch of freaks.
What?
You're not excused!
- You're punished!
- He's all right. Lascia lui.
Move this car and your life
will not be worth shit.
Get me Jewel's autograph.
You're a good kid.
I'll bring you her underpants.
CHRISTOPHER: All goes in there.
- Oh, my God!
- You're robbing a benefit concert.
CHRISTOPHER: Is that all there is?
- Most people used student cards.
GUARD: Hey! What's going on, you?
CHRISTOPHER: Say one word
on that fucking thing and you're dead!
Fuck.
Hit it!
There's your money.
- You ought to hit a tanning salon.
- I had a late night.
Give that shit a rest.
Man needs his seven hours
to keep sharp.
This was work. Little Jackie hyped us
to a score at Rutgers, not bad.
What's the matter, Chrissy?
Tell Uncle Paulie.
Being made isn't like I thought.
A lot of responsibilities.
- What did you think?
- You're as smart as the week's lines.
One mistake and you're chasing,
not making, money.
Welcome to the NFL, rookie.
Go home, get some sleep.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Sorry I'm late.
I had to make a few stops.
- Have a smelt.
- No.
We had a very good week
this week, boss.
- How's our little friend doing?
- He had some knocks.
Came out all right.
Wait'll he hears the policy
on newly-made guys.
They're subject to strip search
for wires.
- He'll love that.
- Mmm.
He had to augment his kick with a
stickup little Jackie put him onto.
Jackie Aprile?
- He did the thing in the papers?
- He was only the wheel man.
- I told Christopher to leave him out.
- I'm just telling you what I know.
Don't be too hard on him.
He's having a hard enough time.
What's wrong with him?
When's he gonna grow up?
- Where's Soprano?
- Here.
Guys, take a good look at Soprano and
remember his performance last week.
He's on the sidelines three quarters,
waiting. Does his mind go soft?
No. Does his fire go out? Heck, no.
When the call came,
he brought his A game.
He may have a big future.
He may be a leader.
That's what it takes. And that's
why I'm naming him defensive captain.
All right! So let's hit those showers,
one thought in mind...
Soprano! Soprano, you all right?

CARMELA:
Ton, will you get that?
- Hello.
- Tony, it's me.
IRINA:
Don 't hang up.
You know who could answer this phone?
Please. You're so conceited.
Do you think I want to call you?
You're drinking and dialing.
I can smell the Stoli.
Yell to your sister, not to me.
My poor cousin...
...has not had her prosthetic leg.
- What do you want me to do?
- Tony, please.
I miss you so much.
Can't you come over here?
Don't you ever call here again.
- Didn't you see my favorite patient?
MELFl: Tomorrow.
- How's that going?
- Let's not, Richard.
- I wish you hadn't taken him back.
- I took you back.
I see the synergy.
Treat him, we start seeing each other.
MELFl: Richard, Richard.
- No, seriously.
If you want to know, he had
a breakthrough last week.
- What? Through somebody's jaw?
- You're right, I'm wasting my time.
Better I boycott with
the Italian American Foundation...
...and save the world from
what is it this week? Gangster?
The idea ABC would think of producing
that stereotypical goombah fest.
Richard, we are an advertisement for
the American experiment. We did great.
I'm fed up with people assuming I'm a
thug because my name ends in a vowel.
Undershirts, yelling.
Hollywood gives sociopaths...
...the tragic grandeur of Al Pacino.
He's an expert at this.
The guy's conning you.
Condescend to me, Richard.
It gets me so hot.
Tell me about this breakthrough.
You said he's alexithymic.
Nothing will get through.
Not if it threatens that straw house
he's built inside his head.
It concerns me you don't see this.
Pink-slip this guy. He's dangerous.
I'll pink-slip you if
you don't do the chicken.
Is that new?
- Looks good.
- Did you bring your log?
- My log?
- Remember? You were to keep a record.
I asked you to write feelings...
...of anxiety or memories
of past anxiety attacks.
My parents and the pork store. I know.
That was... it was interesting.
Have you thought at all about that?
- How do people find the time?
- To get well?
Look, my mother's dead.
I haven't had a panic attack since.
You've gone without them before.
The conflicts that cause them...
...and your depression are
buried deep inside you.
- Are you happy?
- Am I happy?
That's not even...
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't bring the list.
I'll bring it next week.
Will you ever think about
bringing your wife into this?
In here? Carmela?
You're the one who wanted to take
a proactive approach.
That's not in the future.
Let's talk frankly.
You demanded more of me. Fine.
- But you're not trying.
- I know.
The past.
But shit happens in my daily
life that needs attention now.
I got some genuine concerns, you know.
About my son. He shies away
from anything that requires effort...
...and I think he picks
that up from me.
He's in football now. Carmela's as
guilty about this as I am.
She indulges him.
Richard was right.
I've been charmed by a sociopath.
Why didn't I listen?
Why do you think?
Why did I reject Richard
in the first place?
If you think about my life,
it's so textbook.
Marry a man 10 years my senior.
Of course Richard's gonna be
protective and patriarchal.
Then I reject him for being just that.
There's nothing wrong
with wanting to be safe.
I know Richard's right.
I should get Tony Soprano...
Shit.
I always thought it was that
other guy. Little Augie Aprile.
- I can't believe I revealed his name.
- Why did you?
Does Richard know who he is?
I think he saw it in my Day-Timer.
That's why he's been so adamant.
Because Soprano is very high up.
If he was some button man
you wouldn't treat him?
Please, with the terminology.
You know psychotherapy is limited
in the treatment of anxiety disorder.
You've medicated Soprano and helped
him gain insight he's able to absorb.
It's time to send him
on to a behaviorist.
TONY:
Janice!
Janice.
I was cleaning up.
When did you change the locks?
The minute that Ukrainian dye-job
was out the door.
Don't mess with the Russians, Janice.
She can have her leg when
she returns Ma's record collection.
- You would've done the same thing.
- I'm getting calls from her cousin.
Miss Carburetor Works of 1987?
Don't fuck with me on this.
Give back the leg.
Tony, those records are yours too.
It's sad that you don't care.
Those old albums...
They're a window into Ma's soul.
In fact, I'm making a documentary.
World War II generation's music,
exemplified by Ma.
Who are you kidding?
You're gonna sell them on the Internet!
- I have work to do.
- Cleaning the cellar.
Good luck finding gold.
You'd make money working a real job.
Like the minute I'm out you won't have
contractors tearing apart the walls.
Oh, Janice.
Eh, eh, eh.
You finished? I wanna meet my bud at
the gym, we're gonna spar.
You got a girlfriend?
You know who's turning into a little
mink, though? Meadow Soprano.
Look at him perk up.
- I've known her since we were kids.
- Speaking of them...
You did a stickup with Chris?
I wanted to fly to South Beach.
Mom wouldn't pay.
Don't worry. I'm won't tell her.
Look, kid...
I'm trying real hard here.
I know it's tough on you.
- I'm the guy that's dating your mom.
- Dating?
Don't get fucking filthy about it.
Anyway this...
This was a good idea she had,
us going out to dinner.
Not that one conversation
solves anybody's problems.
I'm only here so I don't have
to hear her bitching and crying.
The gym, huh?
Mind if I make a stop first?
My brother is out.
He said you knew.
I get the bad-tempered one.
Bashir said that this
payment would be late...
...because we had truck problems.
Three of them needed new hydraulics.
- Nobody talked to me.
AROUK: He said you approved.
You're collecting on my routes.
You gotta pay me.
Only because you say they are.
You wanna question New Jersey business
practice that goes back 70 years?
Hey! What is this, Ralphie?
I ought to stick a shish kebab
up your ass.
Why do you provoke me?
This young buck.
He'll fuck your wife until she moans.
AROUK: You fucking wop. You began it.
- What did you call me?
- Bringing my wife in this!
- Put it down!
JACKIE, JR: Mister, come on!
- Hey!
RALPH: Get the fucking bat!
- Let go!
- You all right?
JACKIE, JR: Asshole!
RALPH: School this prick.
In the breadbasket!
Good, kid. Introduce him to his desk.
Take an anger management course.
Fucking racial slurs.
Why you doing this to me?
Ow.
That's what you get for using
a baseball bat.
Let's go, kid.
- Yeah?
- Ginny. It's Tony Soprano.
What's wrong with me? I'm a mess here
with the moving. I'll get John.
John! John, get down here!
You got company!
Look who's here.
- The guinea welcome wagon.
- This is for you.
Carmela's bringing something nice to
the housewarming for Ginny.
This is the Great Room.
I don't see what's so great.
It's mediocre. We got a
living room right over there.
I didn't know you were moving.
Ginny wanted to be near her sisters,
you know and the schools out here.
We were with Carmine.
You never mentioned this place.
It's not his favorite subject.
It's what, half an hour,
Why didn't you say you were moving?
- Why?
- I gotta find out second hand?
You care?
You working in a tollbooth?
Besides, I already got
the condo in Point Pleasant.
- You should have told me.
- I'm telling you now.
This is a place to live. I got no
intention of sticking my beak in.
I mean, there's our family
and then there's the Soprano family.
Don't I get to see the rest of this?
You can help me unstick
this rain bird.
I'm a stranger in
a strange land out here.
Look at this pair.
How many Neapolitans
to screw in a light bulb?
There's only candles in Naples.
The cardinal controls that racket.
That's a good one.
Use it on your paesans.
We don't have those bulb jokes.
They don't translate.
Oh.
Tony, I go get a cappuccino.
Two thousand of that is mine.
Sand monkey on 17 is
holding out on us.
- So you put his brother in an ambulance?
- He said a bad word.
Why would you take Jackie's kid
on something like that?
He's got to know how it works.
Kid's got a chip.
So he can keep an eye on
the prick that's banging his mom.
No matter how nice I am,
he still hates me.
I got a daughter that age.
It's all a mystery.
Amen.
Being a parent,
that's the hardest job.
It's harder than this other shit.
- Like my first marriage and my kid...
- I got news you're not gonna like.
- I'm putting him in as captain.
- What?
No.
- Fucking Gigi, are you shitting me?
- I'm sorry.
This shit with the Arab?
I went too far. I'll take care of it.
This isn't the first.
At least tell the truth. You want your
own there to spy on the Aprile crew.
Yeah. But I shouldn't have to.
You got bad tendencies.
I sympathize because I do too.
You partnering with
Joe Brooklyn on shit at the port.
A bum decision.
The bottom line speaks.
I'm earning my ass.
It's my decision.
Jesus Christ, Ton.
I eat dinner at your house.
This is business.
TONY:
See? Turned it off.
I've been thinking about
your course of therapy.
You're the doctor.
You're ready to move on to
behavior modification therapy.
What's that mean?
Talk to somebody else?
Is this because of what
happened last time?
Look, I'm sorry. But like you said,
it's hard to think about that stuff.
- It took how long to even remember?
- I realize that.
You know, you're unbelievable.
I ask you to get serious in here.
When it gets hard,
you pawn me off on somebody else.
I'm just introducing the idea.
Something for you to think about.
I'm going to bring in things for you
about behavior modification therapy.
MELFl:
Yes, he was here earlier today.
Yes, we talked about
behavior mod, but...
Maybe you could.
Listen, I told you
I would discharge him...
...and I will, in my own good time.
I'm going into the garage.
I'm gonna lose you. See you later.
Shut up. Don't turn around.
I said, shut up. I got a knife.
I'll cut you, bitch.
MELFl:
Help!
MELFl: Get off!
- Shut up!
MELFl: I'll give you all my money.
- Get in!
- No!
- Shut up!
- Get the panties off.
MELFl: Stop!
RAPIST: I'm gonna fuck you, bitch!
- No!
Please! No!
RAPIST:
You fucking bitch!
Stop it!
She's almost done.
We just need a few more swabs.
- For God's sake, Jen.
- Richard.
RICHARD:
You're gonna be all right.
I thought that I broke my leg...
...but it's just really
badly sprained.
Jesus. Oh, God.
Bastard.
- Did they tell you they caught him?
- Thank God.
We nabbed somebody with the
description not far from the scene.
He's denying it,
but he had her Palm Pilot.
Says he found it.
This is Detective Piersol.
She's been great.
- There's no way to describe this.
- Of course.
- The son of a bitch. Who is he?
- Jesus Rossi.
- Rossi?
- Lives in Elizabeth. 28, no priors.
- That's an Italian name.
- Am I missing something?
The girl said he was a Puerto Rican,
that's all.
- I just wanna take a shower, okay?
- We'll be done here soon.
All right.
Mom!
- Jason.
- Jesus, Mom.
What did these lousy fuckers do?
I'll be all right.
I'm gonna kill these fuckers.
- Jason.
- Fuck it, Dad!
You know the world is a sewer!
Nothing but a sewer!
It's animals out there running wild!
They're winning!
The police caught the man that did it.
I want five minutes with that asshole!
She doesn't need to hear it.
Why don't you go outside and
settle down? I'll be right out.
CARMELA: Hello?
MELFl: May I speak to Anthony Soprano?
He's not available now.
Who's calling?
This is Jennifer Melfi.
Is this Mrs. Soprano?
CARMELA:
Yes, it is. How are you?
That's why I'm calling,
to cancel his appointment.
He'll be disappointed.
Nothing serious.
A car accident, but I'm fine.
I hope they had insurance.
You weren't hurt, I hope?
My knee got the worst of it. But I'll
be up and about in a couple of days.
CARMELA:
I'll tell him. You stay off of it.
Who ate the cake?
Thank you, I will.
Thank you for giving him the message.
That's gotta be some marriage.
Hello, Kate? This is Jennifer Melfi.
I know the phone upsets you,
but I need to cancel our appointment.
- Tell him what?
- That was your therapist.
Why don't you just announce
it on WFAN? Go find some dust!
She was in a car accident.
She has to cancel.
- She all right?
- She was okay. She hurt her knee.
Her knee? Really? What happened?
I don't know. She didn't say.
I hope she don't need stitches.
Stitches on the knee never heal right.
Can leave a very bad scar.
Any knee injury can be very serious.
You can get arthritis for
the rest of your life.
- Ask Joe Namath.
- No, thanks.
Listen, last time...
...she mentioned that maybe
you would come into my therapy.
Give your perspective on
the panic attacks and kind of...
...our home life. Whatever.
Sure.
But not now. She's sick.
- They call yet?
- No, not yet.
I thought they'd call by now.
They said they'd call when
they want us to come down.
Look, I'm gonna call them.
Where's that detective's card?
They said they'd call.
I don't want to bother them.
I'm not gonna let you just wait here.
I'm gonna call them.
Hello. Hi, Detective Piersol?
I'm on hold.
She is? Then maybe you can help me.
This is Dr. La Penna.
I'm calling for Jennifer Melfi.
The rape. Right, Detective Piersol
was gonna call...
...when you were ready
for us to come down.
What? Why not?
What's going on?
- Why? That's ridiculous.
- What happened?
It isn't Piersol.
She's moved.
She never said anything.
You just let him go?
Are you fucking crazy?
Yes, I do need to use
this kind of language!
- I don't care if you're sorry.
- Richard.
Fine, you do that.
You haven't heard the end of this.
I'm contacting my attorney. Asshole!
- What?
- Chain of custody was mishandled...
...so they let him go.
- They let him go?
Somebody misplaced
the evidence kit or something...
I don't know what they did,
those idiots!
Is he just out until the trial?
I can identify him.
It's a legal thing. I think they
just have to let him skip.
That's impossible. You misunderstood.
Give me the phone.
- I told you what he told me.
- Before or after you cursed at him?
- Give me the phone. I'll call them.
- All right. I'll call.
Detective Lindheim, please.
Yes, I'll hold.
Now it's not even the same cop.
Hello. Dick La Penna again. I want to
apologize for losing my temper.
Could I please have the phone?
Just a second.
Hello? I'm sorry, I don't
understand what's going on.
I don't know what you people did,
but I can identify him.
I don't know what to say. I'm stunned.
They had to let him go...
...because they fouled up
the chain of custody.
What am I gonna do?
You're gonna have someone
escort you to your car.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what the counselor told me.
Deserted garages are
where attacks happen.
You think this is my fault.
Do you blame me for what happened?
I told you to call security
when it's late.
It wasn't late.
- This isn't any good.
- Let me tell you something.
If I hadn't have been on the
phone with you...
...maybe I would've seen
that guy in the stairwell.
- What?
- You and your hard-on about my patient!
So it's my fault?
You should've seen your face...
...when you heard that that shitbag
that raped me had an Italian name.
You're the one who told
them he was Puerto Rican.
What difference does it make?
Are you so ashamed
of your background...
...that any misdeed by an Italian
somehow damages your self-esteem?
This is so misdirected.
The whole fucking world's
about your self-esteem.
Or maybe you don't have enough.
Jennifer, come on.
Fuck you, Richard.
Jen!
How's Ralphie? With you over him?
GIGl:
He busts balls.
He played like it was his idea
for me to be Aprile crew captain.
What is he gonna do?
Tony cut off his cazzi.
Very prudently. Not that you
ain't gonna hear more later.
Most of the conversation
was about Johnny moving.
Ginny told Gabriella
she needs a big house.
Ginny Sacrimoni?
What she needs is her own zip code.
Jersey's a small state.
She moves in, she could tip it over.
I like something to grab onto.
You grab onto her,
your hands will disappear.
- She's so fat, her blood is Ragú.
- When she goes camping...
...bears hide their food.
When Ginny hauls ass,
she's gotta make two trips.
Two guys could fuck her at
the same time and never meet.
TONY:
Johnny!
- Fuck who?
- What?
What's so funny?
Nothing. We're just talking
about a girl.
Is that all you do,
is talk about cooze?
When we're not planting potatoes.
Welcome. You wanna drink?
I mean it.
You don't keep up with events?
- What?
- It's all over 1010 WINS.
It's right there in front of you.
Turn it up.
After years of planning and delays,
there's good news for Newark.
Coming from the Passaic River where
Assemblyman Ronald Zellman...
...held a press conference to
announce the release of $ 25 million...
...in state and federal funds.
The time has come to return Newark
and its waterfront to its past glory.
By the year 2003, this long-neglected
stretch of riverfront...
...will be alive with condominiums,
film studios and public parks.
A self-perpetuating revenue base.
The $ 100 million Newark Museum
of Science and Trucking...
...will serve to make this the
attraction of the area and beyond.
This fucking busted valise,
he's worth every cent of his cut.
Fucking dry wall contracts alone.
ZELLMAN:
- Thank you very much.
Jen, can I come in?
I'm sorry.
I'm just so frustrated.
We both are.
I just want to go find that bastard
and kill him with my hands.
And I could and I would. But I can't.
They'd put me in jail,
that's how things are.
I know.
- You said Satriale's at 1.
- So now you know how it feels.
I know why I'm here and I apologize.
I won't let it happen again.
Let's go.
TONY: I asked you to
watch out for Jackie, Jr.
I said, "Don't let the kid
get involved in this."
I hear about a joint,
and Jackie's a part of it.
He only drove. I said I was sorry.
Let me tell you, he was an asset.
He pissed on the car seats,
but he handled himself very good.
You listening?
Leave him out of it.
CHRIS: He begged me for a taste.
He's the heir apparent.
I don 't want him mixed up in this.
I promised his old man.
- But it's all right for me?
- I didn't say that.
What did you say? The life's good
for me, but not for Lord Fuckpants?
Look, he's not suited to it.
He's not like you. Like us.
Kids today, they're bored,
they're spoiled.
- I promised his old man.
- What? You promised him what?
I don't know.
I was his best friend.
Don't bust my balls.
I gotta go make a stop in Nutley.
Come here.
I love you.
You're a good boy.
Lord Fuckpants? Whose moniker is that?
I'm not sure it is a moniker.
Hi. Come on in.
Jesus. What's the other guy look like?
That must have been some accident.
What happened?
Someone ran a stop sign on
Eisenhower Parkway.
- It was one of those things.
- I know a woman with one leg.
Terrible thing.
Last time we met we talked about
getting you into behavioral therapy.
I brought a couple of things
for you to look at.
"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway."
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
The title leaves something
to be desired.
It's okay, it's just your...
It's okay. I'm sorry. Sorry.
You want me to...?
- It startled me, that's all.
- Maybe you came back too soon.
- It's better for me to be busy.
- Right.
I'm okay. Really.
And I appreciate your concern.
That's what's wrong with the world.
A person is minding
their own business...
...and some fucking asshole comes out
and smashes into them.
- You can't control everything.
- You can get pissed off.
And then what? Lose control?
You direct your
anger where it belongs.
You have panic attacks.
Panic occurs when feelings of anger,
revenge, whatever, overwhelm you.
That's where behavioral therapy
comes in.
It can teach you to control
those triggers.
How do you get people
to do what you want?
You tell your mother it's
hers anytime she wants it.
- How was your cousin's shower?
- It sounded like screaming.
I wondered whose Z24 was in
the driveway. You get a car?
Yeah.
Where did I put the sleeves
to that samovar?
- You want anything? A Coke?
- No, I'm set, Ton.
I heard Ralph Cifaretto
got passed over.
You heard about what? Who?
I'm saying that was probably smart.
- He's kind of a cool guy...
- That's none of your concern.
You were going to college.
I hear shit from Chris?
- You didn't talk to Chris. Shit.
- That's right.
I promised your dad.
Don't make this hard.
I got a son to bust my balls.
MEADOW:
I'm home!
Ma?
Hey, Jackie. What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for you.
What? No hello?
I need $200 to put in
my student account.
We haven't talked for weeks.
I look forward to total
independence, believe me.
African-Americans go to Columbia.
Some are my friends.
My ass. On my couch, watching TV
with his shoes off with you?
Meadow, when did you get here?
See you. Say hi to your mom.
Come into the city, we'll do sushi.
I won't say anything.
You just remember
what we talked about.
MELFl: I'll have a chicken
avocado wrap, no dressing. And a Coke.
One number three,
dressing on the side.
Thanks.
Excuse me. Wait a minute.
Let go of me! Let the fuck go of me!
- We don't wanna continue. Give us leg.
- What leg?
Don't do this to me.
Don't push me to edge. Repent!
Motherfucker, do you know
who my brother is?
- Mother, what did you say?
- Mother...
Those records were all I had of my
mother. What could they mean to her?
- Are you people really so callous...?
- Fuck you. You are callous.
JESUS:
Oh, my God! Help me, please!
I felt such a sense of relief.
I felt safe for the first time.
Empowered.
The vending machine?
My guilt for putting myself
in harm's way.
I read about that too,
that honeymooner...
...who rocked a vending machine
and it fell on him and killed him.
The dog though, I don't know.
The forbidden part of your psyche,
murderous rage.
Yeah, but at first I thought
he was after me.
The door said, "Danger."
Actually, no, it said, "High Voltage.
Call NJGE Before Digging."
"Jersey Gas and Electric."
- Was Richard anywhere in all this?
- No.
Oh, my God. The dog.
- What?
- A rottweiler, Elliot.
Big head. Massive shoulders.
Descendent of the dog used by
the Roman armies to guard their camps.
- I didn't know that.
- Digging?
Who do I dig with?
And who's dangerous?
Who could I sic on that son of a bitch
to tear him to shreds?
- Oh.
- Let me tell you something.
No feeling has ever been so sweet
as to see that pig beg...
...and plead and scream for life.
Because the justice system
is fucked up, Elliot.
Richard's attorney is
in this at $300 an hour.
Meanwhile, that
employee of the month cocksucker...
...is back on the street,
and who's gonna stop him? You?
Jennifer...
- Civilization...
- Don't worry.
I'm not going to break
the social compact.
But that's not saying there's not a
certain satisfaction in knowing...
...that I could have that asshole
squashed like a bug.
If I wanted.
What happened?
Janice?
I can't drive.
And they broke three ribs.
What did I tell you? I told you
not to mess with those people.
I was supposed to be married
at this point.
- Yeah? So?
- The man I loved died.
This is all I fucking need.
Thanks, Janice.
- What?
- What do you mean?
- They slapped my sister around.
- Oh.
I have to get payback.
It's always something.
Every time I hear your voice,
I know it's gonna cost me.
Time. Money. You never do anything
to simplify my life.
I stole a woman's prosthetic leg.
When did I get like this?
- You really wanna know?
- When Richie died.
Till that time, I was functioning
at a very high level.
There's only one trajectory for me.
Really?
- God.
- You see what I mean?
All this soul-searching,
it's always on my dime.
I've hit bottom, Tony.
But it's odd because
I feel born again in the Lord.
- Hm.
- And I prayed to God and I asked him...
...to forgive Svetlana
for what she's done.
We've been here before. With Vishnu
and Richard-fucking-Alpert...
...and the Coyote Spirit.
You know what it always spells?
Trouble for the rest of us.
So put your fucking clothes on.
Seriously. I gotta get out of here.
I give myself up utterly
and totally to God.
If this is the bottom.
If not...
You can go now.
Billing needs to see you.
Follow the blue line.
Carmela.
- Gorgeous as ever.
- My God, this house.
You got one.
Move to Jersey, but maybe take
a little bit of a halfway step?
Fucking wife of mine.
Gentlemen.
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."
He's obsessed with Gladiator.
Come on, it's a great fucking film.
"Strength and honor."
Scotch and soda. Long as you're
on the way to the bar.
Ball breaker.
J & B, right, Ton?
T, what do you think
a place like this...
...set John back?
- Who gives a shit?
Landscape alone's gotta be
- To keep up this lawn...
- Property taxes. Gotta pay those.
SILVIO:
Taxes.
Use the money to
fix air traffic control?
GIGl:
We should fight terrorism.
How about that stampede in
Zimbabwe? Soccer game.
GIGl:
No assigned seating. Always a problem.
You're not using the cane anymore.
Been making my list.
Even bought a little notebook.
Good. That's good.
I've been thinking about your behavior
therapy idea. You got a point.
I could use some help with a few
things. If they can help me there...
...I should go there.
No.
You sure about that?
Because the last couple of times...
...I've been getting the feeling
that you're giving me the boot.
What's the matter?
Hey, come on.
What did I do?
Come on, huh?
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on.
Now, what did I do? What's the matter?
Tell me. What's the matter?
Go sit over there.
We'll do this.
Go.
It's just my knee.
It's okay. Go on.
What?
I mean, you wanna say something?
No.
