"Even if you accept the belief that a high
Trendex means a rising sales curve...."
-Mr. Thornhill?
-Good night, Eddie.
-Say hello to the missus.
-We're not talking.
"My recommendation is still the same.
"Spread the good word in as many
small time segments as we can.
"Let the opposition have their high ratings
while we cry all the way to the bank.
"Let's colonize at the Colony
one day next week for lunch.
"Let me hear from you, Sam.
Happy thoughts, etc...."
You better walk me to the Plaza.
-I didn't put a coat on.
-Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.
-Next?
-Gretchen Sabinson.
Oh, yes.
Send her a box of candy from Blum's.
$10. You know the kind.
Each piece wrapped in gold paper.
She'll think she's eating money.
Just tell her:
"Darling, I count the days, the hours--"
-You sent that one last time.
-I did?
Put: "Something for your sweet tooth,
baby, and all your other sweet parts! "
I know.
Could we take a cab?
-For two blocks?
-You're late and I'm tired.
That's your trouble, Maggie,
you don't eat properly.
Here. Taxi.
I have a very sick woman here.
You don't mind, do you?
Thank you very much.
Perfectly all right.
First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.
Poor man.
I made him a happy man.
I made him feel like a good Samaritan.
He knew you were lying.
In the world of advertising,
there's no such thing as a lie.
There's only "the expedient exaggeration."
You ought to know that.
Do I look heavyish to you?
What?
I feel heavyish.
Put a note on my desk in the morning:
"Think thin."
"Think thin."
Better make it the 59th Street entrance.
Okay.
Soon as you get back, call my mother.
Remind her we have theatre tickets
for tonight.
Dinner at 21, 7:00.
I'll have had two martini's at the Oak Bar
so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.
-She doesn't do that.
-Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.
Bigelow at 10:30 is your first for tomorrow.
The Skin Glow rehearsal's at noon.
Then lunch with Falcon and his wife.
-Where was that?
-Larry and Arnold's, 1 :00.
-Will you check in later?
-Absolutely not.
Here, Driver. Take this lady
back where she belongs.
-Right.
-That ought to cover it.
-Don't forget, call my mother right away.
-I won't.
-Good night, Mr. Thornhill.
-Good night.
Wait, Maggie! You can't call her.
She's at Mrs.--
Good evening, Mr. Thornhill.
I'm looking for Mr. Weltner
and two other gentlemen.
Yes, sir. Right this way.
Herman.
-Hello, Roger.
-I'm a little late.
Roger Thornhill. Fanning Nelson.
-We've gotten a head start here.
-That won't last long.
I was saying that you may be slow
in starting, but there's nobody faster.
What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.
I told my secretary to call Mother and
I realized she won't be able to reach her.
Why not?
She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.
-Your secretary?
-No. My mother.
Mr. Kaplan?
It's one of those new apartments,
wet paint and no telephone yet.
Perhaps if I send her a telegram.
Mr. George Kaplan?
Boy!
Kaplan.
I have to send a wire.
Could you send it for me
if I write it out for you?
I'm not permitted to do that, sir,
but if you'll follow me....
-Will you excuse me?
-Go right ahead.
-Right through there, sir.
-Thanks.
Thank you, sir.
What's that supposed to be?
The car is waiting outside.
You'll walk between us saying nothing.
-What are you talking about?
-Let's go.
Go where? Who....
Who are you?
Mere errand boys,
carrying concealed weapons.
His is pointed at your heart, so, please,
no errors of judgment, I beg of you.
What is this? A joke or something?
Yes, a joke. We'll laugh in the car.
Come.
This is ridiculous.
Don't tell me where we're going.
Surprise me.
I left some friends
back there in the Oak Bar.
They'll think I'm awfully rude.
Could we stop off
at a drugstore for a moment...
...so that I could explain
I'm being kidnapped?
Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?
Locked.
TOWNSEND
Who's Townsend?
Really?
Interesting.
-Where is he?
-Upstairs, dressing.
-Tell him I'm here.
-The dinner guests are expected.
Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan."
By the way,
what are we having for dessert?
-Is anyone in the library?
-No.
This way.
You will wait here.
Don't hurry. I'll catch up on my reading.
MR. LESTER TOWNSEND
Good evening.
Not what I expected. A little taller...
...a little more polished than the others.
I'm so glad you're pleased, Mr. Townsend.
But, I'm afraid, just as obvious.
What the devil is all this about?
Why was I brought here?
Games? Must we?
Not that I mind a slight case of abduction,
but I have tickets for the theatre tonight.
To a show I was looking forward to.
I get unreasonable about things like that.
With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theatre.
Leonard, have you met
our distinguished guest?
He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?
My secretary is a great admirer
of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.
Elusiveness, however misguided--
Wait a minute.
Did you call me "Kaplan"?
I know you're a man of many names,
but I'll accept your current choice.
Current choice?
My name is Roger Thornhill.
It's never been anything else.
Of course.
Your friends picked up the wrong package
when they bundled me out here in the car.
Sit down, Mr. Kaplan.
I told you, I'm not Kaplan, whoever he is.
-Excuse me.
-Yes?
The guests are here, dear.
Look after them.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
Now, shall we get down to business?
I'm all for that.
Simply, I'd like you to tell me
how much you know of our arrangements...
...and how you've come by
this information.
-I don't expect to get this for nothing.
-Of course not.
Don't misunderstand.
I don't expect you to fall in
with the suggestion...
...but the least I can do is afford you
the opportunity of surviving the evening.
What is that supposed to mean?
Why don't you surprise me,
Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?
I've told you--
We know where you're headed for.
I know where I'm headed.
The Winter Garden Theatre in New York.
And I think I'd better get going.
Townsend,
you're making a serious mistake.
This is not going to lead
to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.
I'm not Kaplan!
I do wish you would reconsider.
We also know your contact in Pittsburgh
since Jason committed suicide.
What contact?
I've never been in Pittsburgh.
On June 16, you checked
into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh...
...as Mr. George Kaplan
of Berkeley, California.
A week later, you registered
at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel...
...in Philadelphia
as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh.
On August 11,
you stayed at the Statler in Boston.
On August 29, George Kaplan of Boston
registered at the Whittier in Detroit.
At present, you are registered
in Room 796...
...at the Plaza Hotel in New York
as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit.
In two days, you are due
at the Ambassador East in Chicago.
And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel
in Rapid City, South Dakota.
Not me!
There's no sense in maintaining
that you are deceiving us...
...any more than we are deceiving you.
I suppose it wouldn't do any good
to show you ID cards...
...a driver's license, things like that?
They provide you with such good ones.
It's getting late. I have guests.
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.
A simple no.
For the simple reason that I simply
don't know what you're talking about.
Give Mr. Kaplan a drink, Leonard.
A pleasant journey, sir.
Scotch? Rye?
Bourbon? Vodka?
Nothing. I'll take a quick ride
back to town.
That has been arranged.
But first, a libation.
Bourbon!
You drink it.
I've had enough stimulation for one day.
It'll be easier if you take this yourself.
Otherwise, we'll have to insist.
Cheers!
Don't worry about me. I'll take the bus.
Thanks for the lift.
I want this man examined for driving
while intoxicated.
Really?
You see, they tried to kill me.
He won't listen to me.
In a big house. They tried to kill me.
-All right. Let's just go inside.
-I don't want to go inside.
Somebody call the police.
Come on. Come on now.
Okay.
Sit down.
I don't want to sit.
Perfectly all right. See?
We'll get 'em. We'll throw the book
at them. Assault and kidnapping.
Assault with a gun and a bourbon
and a sports car.
We'll get 'em.
You'll be fine after a good night's sleep.
We got a nice cell all made up.
I don't want a cell. I want a policeman.
The car was just reported stolen.
A Mrs. Babson up on Twining Road.
I got to call someone. Where's the phone?
You're allowed one call.
Over here.
Thanks.
You better make it your lawyer.
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.
What am l, a telephone operator?
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.
Just a minute, please.
-Here.
-Thank you.
Hello, Mother?
Mother, this is your son, Roger Thornhill.
Wait a minute, I'll find out.
Where am l?
Glen Cove Police Station.
Glen Cove Police Station.
No, Mother, I have not been drinking.
No, these two men, they poured
a whole bottle of bourbon into me.
No, they didn't give me a chaser.
Come on, let's go.
-Wait, I'm not finished yet.
-Yes, you are. Come on.
Mother, I got to go now.
Get my lawyer right away
and come and bail me out.
Tomorrow morning, tell her.
Tomorrow morning, he says.
I don't know. I'll ask him.
She wants to know who says.
Sergeant Emil Klinger.
Sergeant Emil....
Emil?
Sergeant Emil Klinger.
No. I didn't believe it either.
I'm all right, Mother. Good night.
That was Mother.
Let's go.
Here's your man, Doctor.
What's your name?
Roger Thornhill.
Stick out your tongue and say: "ah."
You better move back.
Have you been drinking?
Doctor, I am gassed.
What were you drinking?
Well, bourbon. See, these two fellas--
-How much would you say you drank?
-What?
-How much would you say you drank?
-About this much.
Mr. Thornhill, my opinion
is that you are definitely intoxicated.
No question about it.
I won't ask your permission to draw blood.
How disgusting!
"You may refuse to permit a blood test
to be made...
"...but if you do,
your license will be revoked."
It was at this point
that Mr. Thornhill succeeded in escaping...
...from his would-be assassins,
and when they gave chase...
...he, naturally, had to drive
as best he could under the circumstances.
How long have you known your client?
Seven years, Your Honor.
Do you know him to be a reasonable man?
Absolutely.
Mother!
Do you believe there is some credence
to this story?
Credence!
Yes, Your Honor. If my client says
this is what happened...
...I'm certain it must've happened.
Damn right.
I want this turned over
to the County Detectives for investigation.
Call them and have them
come here immediately.
Right, Your Honor.
Counselor, I'm going to set this over
for final disposition tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.
I expect you and the defendant to be here,
ready to go to trial.
In the meantime, the County Detectives'll
determine if his story has any basis in fact.
"Basis in fact"? lf I were brought in dead,
you still wouldn't believe--
Wait a minute.
After all, Your Honor,
would I make up such a story?
That is precisely what were intending
to find out, Mr. Thornhill.
Remember me?
-Yes, sir.
-Good.
-Is Mr. Townsend at home?
-No, I'm sorry he's left for the day.
Mrs. Townsend?
-Who shall I say is calling?
-County Detectives.
Come in, please.
This way, please.
This is the room.
I'll call Madam.
You do that.
Here's the sofa where they held me down.
They spilled bourbon all over it.
I'll show you the stains.
Somebody must've cleaned them off.
This is the cabinet
where they keep the liquor.
Scotch, gin, vodka....
And bourbon.
I remember when it used to come
in bottles.
Dear, we were so worried about you!
Did you get home all right?
Of course you did.
Let me look at you.
A little pink-eyed, but aren't we all?
It was a dull party.
You didn't miss a thing.
I want you all to know,
I never saw this woman before last night.
Mrs. Townsend, I'm Capt. Junket
of the Nassau County Detectives.
This is Lt. Harding.
You haven't gotten into trouble, Roger?
-Stop calling me Roger.
-Has he gotten into trouble?
Mr. Thornhill was picked up last night
driving under the influence of alcohol...
...incidentally, in a stolen car...
Stolen car!
...belonging to Mrs. Babson
of Twining Road.
Roger, you said you were going
to call a cab.
You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes?
No, I didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes!
Mr. Thornhill has told us that he was
brought here against his will last night...
...and forcibly intoxicated by some friends
of your husband and set out on the road.
Do you know anything about this?
Roger was a bit tipsy
when he arrived here by cab for dinner.
She's lying.
And I'm afraid he became even worse
as the evening wore on.
Finally, he told us he had to go home
to sleep it off.
I knew I should've served dinner earlier.
What a performance!
Mrs. Townsend, does the name
George Kaplan mean anything to you?
George Kaplan?
-No.
-I didn't think so.
Where's her husband?
He's the one you should be questioning.
Is there any place he can be reached?
Yes. The United Nations.
He's addressing the General Assembly
this afternoon.
All right. So he's addressing
the General Assembly.
-Sorry we had to bother you.
-No bother at all.
Now, wait a minute.
Do you want to get in touch
with my husband, Captain?
No, Mrs. Townsend,
that won't be necessary.
Do you mean you're not going
to do any more about this?
Pay the two dollars.
Goodbye.
-I don't see why you want me along.
-You lend a certain air of respectability.
Don't be sarcastic, Roger.
There you are, dear. Park yourself there.
Well, here it goes.
Hello, Operator.
Have you got a George Kaplan
staying here?
That's right.
You have?
Room 796.
Ring it, will you please?
-You see?
-I see.
I hope he clears up this silly business.
You're ruining my whole day.
Did he leave word when he'd be back?
Really?
Thank you.
That's odd. He hasn't answered
his telephone in two days.
Maybe he got locked in the bathroom.
Mother, do me a favor, will you?
Put on that innocent look you do so well
and go to the desk and get the key to 796.
I wouldn't do such a thing!
-$10?
-Not for all the money in the world.
-$50?
-Roger, you are disgraceful.
Car theft, drunk driving,
assaulting an officer, lying to a judge...
...and now, house-breaking.
-No, hotel-breaking. There's a difference.
-Of five to ten years.
Just a minute, please.
Will you be wanting me
to change your bedding, sir?
Yes. Well, but not right now.
I mention it, because the bed
doesn't seem like it's been slept in...
...and I was wondering
if I ought to change the linens.
Thank you for your interest.
Come on.
She seemed to think I'm Kaplan.
I wonder if I look like Kaplan.
-Look who's here.
-Who? Where?
Our friend who's assembling
the General Assembly this afternoon.
Roger, I think we should go.
Don't be nervous.
-I'm not. I'll be late for the bridge club.
-Good. You'll lose less than usual.
Bulletin, Kaplan has dandruff.
In that case, I think we should leave.
Too late.
-You rang for me, sir?
-Yes. Come in for a moment.
-What's your name?
-Elsie, sir.
-Do you know who I am?
-You're Mr. Kaplan.
When did you first see me?
Outside the door.
Out in the hall a couple of minutes ago.
Don't you remember?
Is that the first time you laid eyes on me?
Can I help it if you're never around,
Mr. Kaplan?
Then how do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?
-What?
-How do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?
Of course you are.
This is Room 796, isn't it?
So, you're the gentleman in Room 796,
aren't you?
All right, Elsie, thanks.
-Will that be all, sir?
-For the time being, yes.
Valet.
Yes, come in.
-Should I hang it in the closet, Mr. Kaplan?
-Yes, please.
Tell me....
What time did I give you that suit?
Last night. Around 6:00.
-Did I give it to you personally?
-Personally?
No. You called down on the phone
and described the suit to me.
Said it would be hanging in your closet.
Like you always do.
-Anything wrong?
-No, I'm just curious.
-Here. Thanks.
-Thank you.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaplan.
Isn't that the damnedest thing?
I'm beginning to think that no one
in the hotel has actually seen Kaplan.
Maybe he has his suits mended
by invisible weavers.
Let me see something.
I don't think that one does
anything for you.
Now, that's much better.
Obviously they've mistaken me
for a much shorter man.
-Should l?
-Certainly not.
Hold that.
It's good to find you in, Mr. Kaplan.
Who is this?
We met only last night and still
you do not recognize my voice.
I should feel offended.
Yes, I know who you are
and I'm not Mr. Kaplan.
Of course not. You answer his telephone,
you live in his hotel room...
...and yet you are not Mr. Kaplan.
Nevertheless,
we are pleased to find you in.
Now wait....
Operator?
Operator, this is Mr. Thorn....
Kaplan in 796.
Where did that call come from?
From the outside or from the lobby?
-Just a minute. I'll see.
-Hurry, please.
Who was it?
One of the men
who tried to kill me last night.
We're back to that one, are we?
-That call was made from the lobby, sir.
-It was?
They're probably on their way up here.
-Let's get out of here.
-I think I'd like to meet these killers.
You gentlemen aren't really trying
to kill my son, are you?
Lobby, please. Watch your step.
Gentlemen, please. Ladies first.
Come along, ladies.
That's right. Come along. Good.
Roger, will you be home for dinner?
-Where to?
-I don't know. Just keep going.
-Take me to the United Nations.
-Right.
General Assembly Building.
Right.
-I'm being followed. Can you do anything?
-Yes, I can.
Do it.
-May I help you?
-Yes, please.
Where will I find Mr. Lester Townsend?
Mr. Lester Townsend of UNIPO?
Did you have an appointment, sir?
Well, yes. He expects me.
Your name, please?
-My name?
-Yes, please.
Kaplan. George Kaplan.
One moment, please.
Wait for me at the corner of 47th.
If you'd give this to one of the attendants
in the public lounge, she'll page him.
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome, Mr. Kaplan.
Page Mr. Lester Townsend, please?
Certainly, Mr. Kaplan.
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.
Please call at the communications desk
of the Public Lounge.
You paged me?
-Mr. Kaplan?
-Yes.
You wanted to see Mr. Townsend.
This is Mr. Townsend.
How do you do, Mr. Kaplan?
This isn't Mr. Townsend.
Yes, it is.
There must be some mistake.
Mr. Lester Townsend?
That's me. What can I do for you?
Are you the Townsend
who lives in Glen Cove?
That's right. Are we neighbors?
A large, red-brick house
with a curved, tree-lined driveway?
That's the one.
Were you at home last night?
-You mean in Glen Cove?
-Yes.
I've been staying in my apartment
in town for the last month.
I always do when we're in session here.
What about Mrs. Townsend?
My wife has been dead for many years.
Mr. Kaplan, what's this all about?
Who are those people living in your house?
What people?
The house is completely closed up.
There's just a gardener and his wife
living on the grounds.
Now, Mr. Kaplan, tell me who you are
and what you want.
Do you know this man?
Look!
He's got a knife! Look out!
Listen to me.
I had nothing to do with this.
-Call the police.
-Don't come any nearer!
Get back!
UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
"The photograph has been identified
as that of Roger Thornhill...
"...a Manhattan advertising executive,
indicating that the name George Kaplan...
"...which he gave to an attendant
in the General Assembly Building...
"...was false.
"A possible motive for the slaying
was suggested by the discovery...
"...that earlier today, Thornhill appeared
in a Glen Cove police court...
"...charged with drunk driving
with a stolen car...
"...and in his defense he charged
that the murder victim, Mr. Townsend...
"...had tried to kill him the night before."
Brother!
What about that?
Does anyone know this Thornhill?
No, not me.
Never heard of him.
Professor?
Apparently, the poor sucker got mistaken
for George Kaplan.
How could he be mistaken for
George Kaplan when he doesn't even exist?
Don't ask me how it happened,
but obviously it happened.
Vandamm's men must have grabbed him
and tried to put him away...
...using Lester Townsend's house.
And the unsuspecting Townsend winds up
with a stray knife in his back.
C'est la guerre.
It's so horribly sad.
Why is it I feel like laughing?
What are we going to do?
Do?
About Mr. Thornhill?
We...do nothing!
Nothing?
That's right. Nothing.
We could congratulate ourselves
on a marvelous stroke of good fortune.
Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan,
created to divert suspicion...
...from our actual agent,
has fortuitously become a live decoy.
Yes, Professor.
How long do you think he'll stay alive?
That's his problem.
What Mrs. Finley means--
I know what she means.
We can't sit back calmly and wait to see
who kills him first!
Vandamm and company or the police?
What can we do to save him
without endangering our own agent?
Aren't we being just a wee bit callous?
No, my dear woman,
we're not being callous.
We didn't invent our non-existent man
and give him the name of George Kaplan...
...establish elaborate behavior patterns
for him...
...move his prop belongings in and out
of hotel rooms, for our private amusement.
We created George Kaplan...
...and labored successfully
to convince Vandamm...
...that this was our agent hot on his trail
for a desperately important reason.
Nobody's denying that!
Very well, then.
If we make the slightest move to suggest
there's no such agent as George Kaplan...
...give any hint to Vandamm he's pursuing
a decoy instead of our own agent...
...then our agent, working right under
Vandamm's very nose...
...will immediately face suspicion,
exposure...
...and assassination.
Like the two others who went before.
Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill, wherever you are.
Train number 25...
...the 20th Century Limited...
...due to leave in 6:00 p.m. for Chicago....
Yes, dear. I know.
Now, listen to me, Mother,
I called the Plaza.
Kaplan checked out and went
to the Ambassador East in Chicago.
That's why I'm--
I can't go to the police. At least not yet.
You saw the newspapers.
My fingerprints are on the knife.
I'm a car thief, a drunk driver,
and a murderer.
I wouldn't have a chance.
I won't have, until I find George Kaplan
who obviously knows what this is about.
No, the train. It's safer.
Because there's no place to hide on a plane
if anyone should recognize me.
You want me to jump off a moving plane?
Well, thank you so much, Mother.
Goodbye.
MANHUNT ON FOR U. N. KILLER
Give me a bedroom
on the 20th Century, please.
It's leaving in five minutes.
I know. Will you make it snappy?
I think they're all sold out.
Sold out?
You can always go coach.
No, I can't do that.
What time is the next train?
Nothing till 10:00. You're in a hurry, huh?
Could you call them
and see what they have?
Something wrong with your eyes?
Yes, they're sensitive to questions.
Will you call them?
Sure. Sure.
Don't go away!
He's at Window 15, upper level. Hurry.
You're in luck, mister.
-Ticket?
-I'm just seeing some friends off.
I have to know their names.
Come here!
I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.
-My fault.
Sorry.
He went that way. I think he got off.
All aboard!
-Thank you.
-Quite all right.
Seven parking tickets.
-Good evening, sir. One?
-Please.
A cocktail before dinner?
-Yes, please. A Gibson.
-Right away.
Here we are again.
Yes.
You recommend anything?
The brook trout.
A little "trouty" but quite good.
Sold.
"Brook...
"...trout."
-There you are.
-Yes, sir.
I know. I look vaguely familiar.
Yes.
You feel you've seen me
somewhere before.
I have that effect on people.
It's something about my face.
It's a nice face.
-You think so?
-I wouldn't say it if I didn't.
Oh, you're that type.
What type?
Honest.
Not really.
Good. Because honest women
frighten me.
Why?
Somehow they seem to put me
at a disadvantage.
-Because you're not honest with them?
-Exactly.
Like that business about
the seven parking tickets?
What I mean is,
the moment I meet an attractive woman...
...l have to start pretending I've no desire
to make love to her.
What makes you think
you have to conceal it?
She might find the idea objectionable.
Then again, she might not.
Think how lucky I am
to have been seated here.
Luck had nothing to do with it.
Fate?
I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here
if you should come in.
Is that a proposition?
I never discuss love on an empty stomach.
You've already eaten.
But you haven't.
Don't you think it's time
we were introduced?
I'm Eve Kendall. I'm 26 and unmarried.
Now you know everything.
What do you do besides lure men
to their doom on the 20th Century Limited?
I'm an industrial designer.
Jack Phillips.
Western sales manager
for Kingby Electronics.
No, you're not. You're Roger Thornhill...
...of Madison Avenue...
...and you're wanted for murder
on every front page in America.
Don't be so modest.
Don't worry.
-I won't say a word.
-How come?
I told you.
It's a nice face.
Is that the only reason?
It's going to be a long night.
True.
I don't particularly like the book
I've started.
You know what I mean?
Let me think.
I know exactly what you mean.
R.O.T.
That's my trademark. R.O.T.
Roger O. Thornhill.
What does the "O" stand for?
Nothing.
I'd invite you to my bedroom
if I had a bedroom.
A roomette?
Nothing, not even a ticket.
I've been playing hide-and-seek
ever since the train left New York.
How awkward for you.
Yes, isn't it?
No place to sleep.
I have a large drawing-room all to myself.
That doesn't seem quite fair.
Drawing-room E.
Car 3901 .
Such a nice number.
It's easy to remember.
See?
No luggage.
So?
You wouldn't happen to have
an extra pair of pajamas, would you?
Wouldn't l?
I wouldn't order any dessert if I were you.
I get the message.
That isn't exactly what I meant.
The train seems to be making
an unscheduled stop.
I saw two men get out of a police car
as we pulled into the station.
They weren't smiling.
You better go out
and tell those police to hurry.
Patience is a virtue.
So is breathing.
Just lie still.
Have you got any olive oil?
Olive oil?
I want to be packed in olive oil
if I'm going to be a sardine.
Come in.
-Who are you?
-State Police.
Your name please?
Eve Kendall. Is anything wrong?
There was a man at your table tonight
in the dining car.
Yes.
Friend of yours?
I never saw him before.
Is this the man?
Yes, I think so.
It's not a very clear picture.
It's a wire-photo.
We just got it from the New York police.
Police?
He's wanted for murder.
Good heavens, no!
The steward said
you left the dining car together.
We might have happened to leave
at the same time but not together.
What did you two talk about?
Talk about?
The waiter said you were getting along fine
with this Thornhill.
Is that his name? Thornhill?
He didn't tell you?
He didn't tell me anything.
All we did was chat about
different kinds of food...
...train travel versus plane travel,
that sort of thing.
Rather innocuous, I must say,
considering he was a fugitive from justice.
Who did he kill?
He didn't say where he was going?
No.
I assumed Chicago.
Perhaps he got off when you got on?
If you happen to see him again, Miss...
Kendall.
...will you let us know?
I'm going to bed and I'll lock my door.
I doubt if I'll see anybody else tonight.
In case you do, we'll be in
the observation car at the rear of the train.
It's comforting to know that.
Good night.
Still breathing?
Either hurry up or get me a snorkel.
I'm looking for the can opener
I stole from the porter.
Hello, there.
Hello.
Tell me, why are you so good to me?
Shall I climb up and tell you why?
I've been thinking...
...it's not safe for you to roam Chicago
looking for this George Kaplan...
...you've been telling me about.
You'll be picked up by the police
the moment you show your face.
It's such a nice face, too.
Don't you think it'd be a better idea
if you stayed in my hotel room...
...while I located him for you
and brought him to you?
I can't let you get involved.
It's too dangerous.
I'm a big girl.
Yeah, and in all the right places, too.
You know, this is ridiculous.
You know that, don't you?
Yes.
I mean, we've hardly met.
That's right.
How do I know you aren't a murderer?
You don't.
Maybe you're planning to murder me,
right here, tonight.
Shall l?
Please do.
Beats flying, doesn't it?
We should stop.
Immediately.
I ought to know more about you.
What more could you know?
You're an advertising man,
that's all I know.
That's right.
The train's a little unsteady.
Who isn't?
What else do you know?
You've got taste in clothes, taste in food....
And taste in women. I like your flavor.
You're very clever with words.
You can probably make them
do anything for you.
Sell people things they don't need...
...make women who don't know you
fall in love with you.
I'm beginning to think I'm underpaid.
Look out.
-Don't bother with the washroom.
-Yes, ma'am.
By the way, I found this on the floor.
Does it belong to you?
Yes, ma'am. I've been looking for it.
-I'll wait outside.
-Thank you.
Thank you, Porter.
Thank you, ma'am. Good night now.
Good night.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
The porter.
So I see.
Where were we?
Here.
Nice of him to have opened the bed.
Only one bed.
That's a good omen, don't you think?
Wonderful.
Do you know what that means?
What? Tell me.
It means you'll sleep on the floor.
A message from the lady in 3901 .
What do I do with him
in the morning? Eve.
-You keep walking. I'll catch up.
-Yes, ma'am.
Anything to report?
Yes. I had a fine night's sleep.
I mean, have you seen the man
we're looking for?
Mr. Thornycroft?
Thornhill.
No, no. I'm awfully sorry.
But good luck to you both.
-How are we doing?
-I may collapse at any moment.
Not yet. First we have to run the gauntlet.
Look.
I'm accustomed to having a load on,
but what have you got in these bags?
-Bowling balls, naturally.
-Oh, naturally.
Which one of these has my suit in it?
The small one underneath your right arm.
Thanks. That ought to do the suit
a lot of good.
I'm sure Mr. Kaplan won't mind
a few wrinkles.
Yeah, if he's still there. What time is it?
his hotel room by now.
I'll call him for you as soon
as we get inside the station.
Thank you. I can do it.
A redcap in a phone booth?
Slightly suspicious.
All right. Do you know
what you'll tell him?
You want to see him right away.
Terribly urgent. Matter of life and death.
-No explanations.
-Right.
While I'm calling,
you can change your clothes.
Where do you propose I do that?
In Marshall Field's window?
I sort of had the men's room in mind.
Did you, now?
You're the smartest girl
I ever spent the night with on a train.
I think we made it.
Where did he go?
-Which way did he go?
-Where did he go?
I don't know. He took my clothes.
He went up that way.
What took you so long?
I have a big face. Small razor.
Tell me, did you get Kaplan?
Yes.
Fine. What did he say?
He'll see you but not at the hotel
under any circumstances.
-He'll see you on the outside.
-Where? When?
-I've got it all written down for you.
-Thanks.
Take the Greyhound Bus
that leaves Chicago...
...for Indianapolis at 2:00 and ask the driver
to let you off at Prairie Stop, Highway 41 .
Prairie Stop, Highway 41 . Good.
It's about an hour-and-a-half's drive
from Chicago.
Fine. I'll rent a car.
No car. Mr. Kaplan said bus.
He wants to be sure you're alone.
All right. What'll I do when I get there?
Just wait beside the road.
He'll be there at 3:30.
-How will I know him?
-He'll know you.
You made the Chicago papers, too.
Have you set your watch for Central time?
Yes, I did that. Thanks.
What's the matter?
Matter?
Yes, you seem.... I don't know.
You seem tense.
You better go before the police
run out of red caps.
We'll see each other again, won't we?
Sometime, I'm sure.
I never had a moment
to thank you properly.
-Please go.
-But where will I find you?
I've got to pick up my bags now.
Yes. These are the checks
for the large cases.
Wait a minute.
Please.
They're coming.
