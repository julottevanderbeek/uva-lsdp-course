WHAT IS THIS ?
YOU'RE A HOSTAGE,
CHARLIE.
- FOR WHAT ?
- MR. BARRET,
WE NEED YOUR HELP.
MY SISTER, ELISE,
HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED.
THE KIDNAPPERS DEMANDED
$2,000,000 RANSOM.
MY FATHER HAS MONEY,
BUT IT'S ALL ON PAPER.
HE WENT TO THE COPS.
THAT'S A BIG MISTAKE.
I GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH KIDNAPPING.
AH, COME ON, CHARLIE.
WE KNOW THAT.
BUT YOU GOT CONTACTS,
THE KIND THAT KNOW
HOW TO FIX THESE THINGS,
AND YOU GOT MONEY, CASH--
THAT'S THE GOOD KIND--
SO WE'RE ALSO GONNA HAVE TO
ASK YOU TO PUT UP THE RANSOM.
IT'S TOO BAD
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE WAS A TIME
I COULDA DONE SOMETHING.
THESE DAYS, I'M A BUSINESSMAN.
I PAY MY TAXES
LIKE YOUR MOMS AND DADS DO.
ONCE A CRIMINAL,
ALWAYS A CRIMINAL.
THAT'S WHAT MY DAD SAYS.
YEAH ?  WHAT'S
YOUR MOTHER SAY ?
STOP THAT !
STOP IT !
GUYS, WHAT
YOU DID TO ME
IS UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE WAS
A TIME I'D BE LOOKIN' AT
FOUR DEAD BODIES BY NOW.
BUT, STRANGE AS IT SEEMS,
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'
AND WHY YOU'RE DOIN' IT.
SO I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
AN OPPORTUNITY.
GET OUT OF THIS.
NOW.
BEFORE IT GETS SO FUCKED UP
NOBODY COULD EVER RECOVER.
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYIN' ?
YES, YOU DO.
UNTIE ME.
POUR ME A DRINK.
I CALL MY CAR.
WE ACT LIKE
NOTHING HAPPENED.
I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING.
OKAY ?
YOU GOT MY WORD.
OH, OKAY.  GO AHEAD.
YOU CAN GO.  WHAT KIND
OF DRINK WOULD YOU LIKE ?
THIS IS BULLSHIT.  "UNTIE ME,
POUR ME A DRINK."  I TOLD YOU
HE WOULDN'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY.
SHUT UP !
I TOLD YOU WE DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE.
WHAT IS THAT ?
IS THAT BLOOD ?
AFTER MY FATHER MISSED
HIS DEADLINE,
THE KIDNAPPERS SENT A PACKAGE.
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SEND
THESE PACKAGES EVERY 24 HOURS
UNTIL THEY GET THEIR MONEY.
PACKAGE ?  WHAT ?
- WHAT'S IN THE PACKAGE ?
- CHARLIE, WHATEVER CONDITION
ELISE IS RETURNED HOME IN...
IS THE SAME CONDITION
YOU WILL BE RETURNED
TO YOUR HOME.
- WHOSE BLOOD IS THAT ?
- IF SHE LOSES AN EYE,
YOU LOSE AN EYE.
IF SHE LOSES AN EAR,
YOU GET TO LOSE AN EAR.
IF SHE IS HURT,
YOU WILL BE HURT.
LISTEN TO ME:
BY SAVING LISA,
YOU GET TO SAVE YOURSELF.
I ASKED YOU,
WHOSE BLOOD IS THAT ?
WHOSE BLOOD IS THAT ?
FUCK YOU, YOU FREAKS !

IT'LL BE NEXT-YEAR LAND
BEFORE THEY FIND
THOSE MOLARS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, KID ?
YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED YOUR PIZZA.
THEY MUST BE LOCAL.
YEAH,
THEY'RE LOCAL.
THE GOOD NEWS IS
THE GIRL'S STILL ALIVE.
BUT THE BAD NEWS IS WE GOT
SOME SERIOUS PSYCHOS HERE,
SO HER HEALTH MIGHT
SUDDENLY DETERIORATE.
SON OF A BITCH !
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS PLACE
WAS SAFE.  FUCKIN' PRICK !
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'; IT'S A KID.
- YOU MAKE CONTACT ?
- LOOK, JUST GIVE ME
A LITTLE MORE TIME.
I GOTTA HAVE SOMETHING
TO BILL YOU FOR.
WHEN YOU FIND THEM, TELL 'EM YOU
REPRESENT INTERESTED PARTIES,
GONNA COVER THEIR HOLDING FEE.
DON'T SCARE THEM.
RIGHT.  ANYTHING
YOU SAY, CHARLIE.
LOOK, WHAT'S
THE SITUATION THERE, ANYWAY.
I MEAN, ARE YOU ALONE ?
IT'S OKAY, WYATT.
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS--
WELL, WORD IS THEY USED
AN INSIDE PLAYER ON THIS ONE.
- GOTCHA.
-FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
YOU GOT SOME HEAVY PAPER
WITH ANTOINE, AND, UH,
YOU HAVEN'T MADE
MUCH OF AN EFFORT
TO PAY HIM BACK.
WHAT REALLY MAKES
NO-NO-NO FUCKIN' SENSE TO ME...
IS THE WAY YOU WERE RAISED,
WITH YOUR UPPER-CRUSTY FUCKIN'
GREY POUPON BACKGROUND,
THERE'S NOBODY YOU CAN GO TO
TO GET SOME OF THE SCRATCH ?
YOU CAN'T CRACK THE EGG
OUT OF ONE OF THEM OLD FUCKS ?
SEE, NORMALLY, THIS WOULD BE
THE END OF THE CONVERSATION.
THIS IS YOUR LUCKY DAY,
MY FRIEND.
CAN I TELL HIM ?
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
HERE FOR.  TELL HIM.
MY PARTNER AND I,
WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF
YOUR DEBT WITH ANTOINE.
SO NOW YOU OWE US.
YOU CAN SETTLE EVERYTHING.
CLEAN.
NO MORE DEBT
HANGIN' OVER YOUR HEAD.
YOU CAN GO BACK TO YOUR
DEBUTANTES AND YOUR
IVY LEAGUES AND EVERYTHING.
AND IT'LL BE LIKE
NOTHIN' EVER HAPPENED.
JUST BE SMART, KID.
EVERYBODY WINS,
NOBODY GETS HURT, RIGHT ?
BE SMART.  USE THE GRAPE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN' ?
IT'S NICE AND EASY.
NOBODY GETS HURT.
BOP-BOP-BOP-BOP.  THAT'S IT.

WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM ?
WHERE THE FUCK

GOTCHA.  OKAY.

WHAT HAPPENED ?
- UH,

WHO TOOK THE GIRL.

DON'T GET EXCITED.
THE WHOLE THING
COULD GO BELLY-UP.
MANY THINGS GO WRONG.

IT'S GONE RIGHT.
IT WON'T GO WRONG.
IS IT HAPPY HOUR ?
WHERE THE FUCK

OKAY. WHAT CAN
I GET YOU ?
GIVE HIM A SHOT AND A HALF
OF WHISKEY, WOULD YOU ?
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ?

I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU DID.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS.
WHAT ?

THAT'S WHAT YOU DID; GIMME THIS.
WHAT ?
I HARDLY THINK
HE'LL NOTICE, IRA.
OH NO ?  DUH.

OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THIS.

LOOK AT THAT, HUH ?
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS JUST STAB ME
IN THE FUCKIN' BACK RIGHT NOW !
STAB ME IN THE FUCKING BACK
RIGHT NOW !
IRA, IS THIS
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS ?
IRA DOESN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THIS PLACE IS LIKE
GODDAMN WOODSTOCK.
WHO IS IT ?
FUCKIN' RENT-A-COP.
SHIT !  IRA, DON'T ANSWER IT.
WHAT THE--  "DON'T ANSWER IT."
I HAVE TO ANSWER IT.
IF I DON'T, THEY CALL THE COPS.
THEN THE COPS'LL CALL MY FATHER,
AND THEN HE'LL BE HERE.
THEN WE'LL ALL BE DEAD.
SORRY.  I ALREADY AM DEAD,
THANK YOU.
IRA, GET HIM

I'LL HAVE TO DO
A WALK-THROUGH, SIR.

REMEMBER:
KEEP THE DOOR SHUT.
MAKE SURE
SHE DON'T GET OUT.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

KING OF THE DICKS.
HOW 'BOUT WE PUT
OUR HEADS TOGETHER,
FIGURE THIS OUT.  GUYS.
WHAT ?
CAN ANYBODY TELL ME
ANYTHING THAT COULD HELP ?
- NOTHIN' WE HAVEN'T ALREADY
TOLD THE POLICE.
- COPS.  FUCK 'EM.  TELL ME.
UH, WE WERE GOING TO GO
INTO THE CITY,
HIT A COUPLE PARTIES,
HIT A COUPLE CLUBS,
AND, UH, MAX AND LISA
WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET US
AT MIDNIGHT.
AND MIDNIGHT CAME
AND THEY NEVER SHOWED UP.
YOU WERE WITH THE GIRL ?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
-  WAS THERE
SOMETHING GOING ON ?
YEAH, WE BEEN TOGETHER
ALMOST A YEAR.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ?
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
SO YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.
- I TOLD IT A THOUSAND TIMES.
- I DIDN'T HEAR IT THAT TIME.
TELL ME AGAIN.
WE SPENT MOST OF THE DAY
ON THE BOAT.  WE LEFT,
WE WERE GOIN' DOWNTOWN--
BOAT ?
WHAT BOAT ?
IT'S MY DAD'S BOAT.
IT'S MORE LIKE A YACHT.
HE NEVER USES IT.
HE'S AFRAID OF THE WATER.
IT MAKES HIM SEASICK.
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
HE NEVER LOOKS FOR
ME AND ELISE.
LET ME BE CLEAR.
YOU TWO WERE SNAKIN' AROUND
BEHIND HIS BACK.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
A CHOICE.
IF MY DAD KNEW THAT
THEY WERE SEEING EACH OTHER,
HE'D HAVE A HEART ATTACK.
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE ?
I'M GONNA DECIDE THAT.
OKAY, YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED FROM THE TIME
YOU LEFT THE BOAT.
IT'S JUST LIKE BRETT SAID.
WE WERE GOING TO MEET HIM
AT A PARTY.
SO WE WENT DOWNTOWN.
I WAS ON LEX.
THERE WAS A PILEUP...
IN THE CENTER LANE,
SO I EXITED AT 96th STREET.
IT WAS DARK.
WE ENDED UP IN SOME DOCKYARD.
IT WAS RAINING LIKE HELL,
I END UP ON THE DARK SIDE
OF THE FUCKING MOON.
????
OKAY, WE'RE LOST.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
SO, THE FIRST LEFT
OR THAT THIRD RIGHT ?
OR MAYBE THAT POTHOLE
THAT THREW ME OFF BALANCE.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA LET ME
LIVE THIS DOWN, ARE YOU ?
LOCK THE DOORS, BABE.
CHECK THE GLOVE BOX.
SEE IF THERE'S A MAP.
MMM.
????
MMM.  MMM.
ELISE, YOU'RE NOT MAKIN' THIS
EASY ON ME.
GOOD.  I WAS GOIN'
FOR HARD.
MAX, PROMISE ME
SOMETHING.
NO MATTER WHAT
MY FATHER SAYS OR DOES,
YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE ME.
NEVER.
JUST PROMISE.
I PROMISE.
HEY.
YOU'RE MY ANGEL.
YOU KNOW THAT,
DON'T YOU ?
YEAH.

OF COURSE
I'LL MARRY YOU.
YEAH ?

IN SILENT STREAMS ??
?? WE DREAM ????
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
FUCK, I PAY
THE ELECTRIC BILLS, I PAY
THE GROCERY BILLS, SHOE BILLS--
SHE'S BUYIN' SHOES
LEFT AND RIGHT.
EVEN BRING IN A VIETNAMESE
CHICK THAT I PAY TWICE A WEEK
TO PAINT HER TOENAILS.
CHEAPER TO HAVE
HER WHACKED.
- WIFE, I MEAN.
- I AIN'T NEVER HAD
NO SLOPE PUSSY BEFORE.
TOO YOUNG FOR KOREA,
TOO OLD FOR 'NAM.
DR. MENGELE, WHAT HAPPENED ?
CHOP OFF ANOTHER FINGER ?
- NO, WHY ?
- 'CAUSE I DON'T FEEL GOOD.
IT'S JUST THE MEDICATION.
IT CAN TEND TO MAKE YOU FEEL
A LITTLE NAUSEOUS.
I'LL CUT IT BACK SOME.
- GOOD.
-  HEY, BRETT, I'M
GONNA HAVE TO ELEVATE HIS ARM.
AND UNTIE IT ?
NO.  NO WAY.
SORRY, I GOT NO CHOICE.
AH, BRETT.
GO AHEAD.
DON'T GIVE ME A REASON
TO USE THIS, CHARLIE, AND YOU
GOT NOTHIN' TO WORRY ABOUT.
FINE.  COME ON.
DON'T POINT THAT.
THAT GUN
IS OFFICIALLY
BUMMING ME OUT.
BRETT, JUST PUT
THE GUN AWAY.
- H-HE'S ALL TIED UP.
HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
- SORRY, LADIES.  THE GUN STAYS.
- BRETT, THE FUCKIN' THING
IS POINTED RIGHT AT ME.
- THE THING COULD GO OFF.
IRA COULD GET LAID.  WHO CARES.
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
GO IN THE OTHER ROOM.
HEY, CHASE,
COULD YOU HAND ME
THAT PILLOW REAL FAST ?
IRA'S GONNA BE VERY UPSET
IF YOU SPOIL HIS CUSHION.
YOU'RE
PRETTY FUNNY FOR A GUY WITH
NINE FINGERS.  HOW WE DOIN', T ?
YEAH, GOOD.
CAN I HAVE A DRINK ?
- BRETT, COULD YOU GET HIM
SOME WATER ?
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.
YEAH, WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO
DO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT
JEOPARDIZE YOUR LIFE.
IT'S WAY TOO LATE
FOR THAT, MY SON.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
TO US DEAD, CHARLIE.
I'LL GET THE WATER.
YEAH, MAYBE A CRUST OF BREAD
AND MAYBE SOME NAIL SHAVINGS.
YOU'RE GONNA BE A DOCTOR
LIKE YOUR DAD ?
THAT'S THE PLAN.
YOU BETTER HOPE THE AMA
DON'T GET WIND
OF THIS EPISODE.
THEY MIGHT HOLD IT
AGAINST YOU.
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL 'EM,
ARE YOU ?
- I'M NO RAT.
I BET IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA
WHEN YOU WERE COOKIN' IT UP.
IT'S DIFFERENT
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.
RICH KID.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE STOMACH
FOR THIS KIND OF THING.
- WELL--
- THE DRUGS HELP, RIGHT ?
THEY MAKE YOU BRAVE.
YOU'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
A LONG TIME ?
THE GUYS ?
GOD, SINCE FOREVER,
REALLY.
- YOU TRUST EACH OTHER
WITH YOUR LIFE.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK ?  YES.
WELL, WHAT IF ONE OF
YOUR FRIENDS TURNED OUT TO BE...
NOT SUCH A GOOD FRIEND
AFTER ALL.
WOULD YOU STICK YOUR
NECK OUT FOR HIM STILL ?
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT ?
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
WHOEVER'S BEHIND
THIS KIDNAPPING...
IS USING
AN INSIDE PLAYER.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
LIKE SOMEBODY WHO KNEW ELISE
HELPED KIDNAP HER ?
NOT SOMEBODY WHO KNEW HER,
SOMEBODY IN THIS HOUSE.
THAT'S INSANE.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
GETTING YOUR INFORMATION,
BUT IT'S UNRELIABLE.
ISN'T IT ?
THAT PHONE CALL I GOT,
IT COMES FROM OUTSIDE
HIGH WALLS AND FANCY GATES.
IT COMES FROM A PLACE
YOU KNOW ABOUT
MAYBE FROM THE MOVIES.
BUT I COME FROM OUT THERE.
AND WHAT EVERYBODY
OUT THERE KNOWS...
EVERYBODY LIES.
COPS LIE,
NEWSPAPERS LIE,
YOUR PARENTS LIE.
THE ONE THING
YOU CAN COUNT ON:
WORD ON THE STREET.
YEAH, THAT'S SOLID.
YOU'RE A SMART KID.
YOU'LL MAKE
A GOOD DOCTOR SOMEDAY...
IF YOU LIVE.
YEAH.  I'M GONNA GO SEE
WHAT'S KEEPING BRETT
WITH YOUR WATER.
HEY.  CHARLIE WANTS
HIS WATER, BRETT.
YOU LEFT HIM ALONE ?
WHERE WERE YOU ?
YOU WERE COMING RIGHT BACK.
I'LL GET IT.
JESUS CHRIST.
MAX, JUST WATER,
OKAY ?
HOW'S HE DOIN' T.K. ?
OH, HE'S GOOD.
HE'S GOOD.
WE GOT A PROBLEM,
I THINK.
WHAT'S UP, BUD ?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM ?
UH, CHARLIE MAY BE
AN ALCOHOLIC.
GET OUT !
SO WHAT ?
WELL,
AN ALCOHOLIC'S LIVER...
DOES NOT PRODUCE
VITAMIN K.
WHICH MEANS ?
VITAMIN K IS ESSENTIAL--
IT IS A FACTOR THAT IS
ESSENTIAL FOR BLOOD CLOTTING.
YEAH ?  SO ?
BLOOD CLOTTING ?
WELL, IT'S FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT.
WHAT, IS HE GONNA
BLEED TO DEATH ?
YES,
EVENTUALLY.
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE'S
DROPPING.
OH, FUCK.
FUCKING GREAT.
FUCKING GREAT.
A DEAD MOBSTER
IN THE LIVING ROOM.
GREAT.  THAT'LL BE
GOOD TOO.  FUCK !
WHY DIDN'T YOU THINK OF THIS ?
WHY DIDN'T YOU ?
'CAUSE I'M NOT
A DOCTOR.
YEAH, WELL,
NEITHER AM I.
YOU'RE LOOKIN' GOOD.
I'M TALKIN' TO YOU !
I'M GOIN' OUT.
WELL, THEN HOW 'BOUT
YOU GET YOUR NEW DADDY
ANOTHER BEER ?
NOW, YOU OUGHT TO LEARN TO
CONTROL THAT TEMPER OF YOURS.
YOU'RE GETTIN' MORE LIKE
YOUR FUCKIN' MOTHER
EVERY DAY.
- WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER
AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU ?
-
HEY, JENNIFER.
LONO, WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' HERE ?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ?
WAIT HERE, OKAY ?
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU ?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
THINK OF ME AS, UH,
A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF
MY HOUSE, ASSHOLE.
WELL,
IF YOU'LL GIVE ME
A COUPLE MINUTES
OF YOUR TIME,
I'VE GOT A FEW THINGS
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
YOU KNOW, UH,
WHAT YOU DID
WASN'T REALLY YOUR FAULT.
IT'S WHAT THEY CALL
A GENETIC DEFECT.
MOM CALLED IT "THE GENE."
MY GRANDFATHER
HAD THE GENE.
HE, UH,
CAME OVER ON THE BOAT
FROM IRELAND IN 1912.
AND I GUESS HE PASSED IT ON
TO MY OLD MAN.
MY OLD MAN WAS A GREAT GUY.
A REAL PUSSYCAT.
A HARD WORKER.
BIG SPORTS FAN.
BUT SOMETIMES,
ON HIS WAY HOME
FROM THE DOCKS, HE LIKED TO
STOP IN WITH THE GUYS,
AND HAVE A COUPLE
OF BEERS, YOU KNOW.
I REMEMBER COMIN' HOME
FROM SCHOOL ONE DAY,
AND THE WHOLE HOUSE
WAS DARK.
COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
I HEARD MY MOM CRYIN'
OFF IN THE DARK SOMEPLACE.
I WAS OLD ENOUGH AT THAT POINT;
I COULD REACH
THE LIGHT SWITCH...
AND TURN THE LIGHTS ON.
AND I SAW...
WHAT HE DID TO HER.
SO I WENT TO MY ROOM
AND I GOT THE BASEBALL BAT--
MICKEY MANTLE MODEL
MY OLD MAN GAVE ME
FOR CHRISTMAS--
AND I FOUND THE OLD MAN
PASSED OUT IN THE BATHTUB.
AND I TATTOOED HIM.
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
WHEN I CAME HOME EVERY DAY
FROM SCHOOL AFTER THAT,
THE HOUSE WAS LIT UP
LIKE EBBETTS FIELD.
THE OLD MAN, UH,
NEVER DRANK AGAIN.
SO,
ALL I'M SAYIN' TO YOU IS
IF YOU WANT TO DRINK,
GO AHEAD AND DRINK.
BUT IF I EVER FIND OUT
THAT YOU LAID YOUR HANDS
ON THAT LITTLE GIRL AGAIN,
ME AND MR. MANTLE
ARE GONNA PAY YOU A VISIT,
MY FRIEND.
- ARE YOU DONE ?
- YEAH, I'M DONE.
GOOD.
OH,
ON YOUR WAY OUT,
SEND THAT LITTLE WHORE
BACK IN HERE.
I HAVEN'T FINISHED
WITH HER YET.
SORRY ABOUT
THE TOASTER.
ANY TIME.
THERE WERE A COUPLE
OF YOUR FRIENDS AT THE BAR
THIS AFTERNOON.
DO YOU KNOW THEIR NAMES ?
YEAH, AVERY,
MAX, BRETT.
OH, YEAH.
THAT BETTER ?
YEAH, YEAH.
THANK YOU.
SHE MUST BE
SOME KIND OF WOMAN.
- WHO'S THAT ?
- ELISE.
BEAUTIFUL, HUH ?
OH, SHE'S MORE
THAN BEAUTIFUL.
SHE'S GOT THIS WAY SHE LOOKS
AT YOU THAT CAN JUST...
STOP YOUR HEART,
YOU KNOW, AND MAKE IT
START BACK UP AGAIN.
- YOU KNOW ANY GIRLS
LIKE THAT ?
- YEAH.
ALL OF THEM.
SO, WHAT'S HER FATHER
GOT AGAINST YOU ?
YOU DIDN'T BY CHANCE
CHOP HIS FINGER OFF ?
KIDNAP HIM ?
NO, NO.
ELISE'S OLD MAN,
HE'S SUCH
A FUCKING HYPOCRITE.
HE'S LIKE THIS RICH,
FAT BASTARD WHO'S NEVER AROUND,
YOU KNOW ?
HE'LL FUCK ANYTHING WARM.
MEANWHILE, HIS WIFE'S AT HOME
HAMMERED ON PILLS AND BOOZE...
AND CAN'T REMEMBER
WHO SHE'S FUCKING.
YOU EVER SEE THAT MOVIE
THE GRADUATE?
I LOVED THAT MOVIE.
MRS. ROBINSON--
THAT'S ELISE'S MOTHER.
THE ONE TIME HER HUSBAND COMES
HOME EARLY, SHE'S FINALLY GOTTEN
AROUND TO BANGING MY FATHER.
FATHER NUMBER THREE,
BUT WHO'S COUNTIN' RIGHT ?
AFTER THAT,
EVERYBODY HATED EVERYBODY.
I WAS NO LONGER
ALLOWED TO SEE ELISE.
BUT GET THIS,
I'M LIKE-- I'M LIKE
NINE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME.
DOES THAT MAKE
ANY SENSE TO YOU AT ALL ?
LIFE DON'T MAKE SENSE.
IT'S NOT FAIR.
IT DOESN'T FOLLOW LOGIC
OR OBEY ORDERS.
MAX, YOU GOT A CHANCE
RIGHT NOW.
STOP THIS
FROM GOIN' FURTHER.
I KNOW YOU GOT NO REASON
TO TRUST ME, BUT...
YOU LET ME WALK,
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
FOR ELISE.
MY WORD,
YOU'VE GOT IT.
HONESTLY,
MR. BARRET,
I NEVER WANTED TO
CUT YOUR FINGER OFF.
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
BUT I CAN'T LET YOU GO.
WHAT IS THAT ?
- SHIT.
- OH, THAT'S SPOOKY.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON ?
MUST BE THE STORM.
IRA, WHERE'S THE FUSE BOX ?
I DON'T KNOW.
- IRA, YOU LIVE HERE.
- IT'S OUTSIDE... SOMEWHERE.
- HOW 'BOUT YOU CHECK IT OUT ?
- WHAT, ALONE ?
- I'LL GO WITH YOU.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOUR FUSE BOX IS, IRA.
SO SUE ME, ALL RIGHT ?
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN IT GOES OUT ?
DO YOU HIRE SOMEBODY
TO FIND IT ?
WHAT WAS THAT ?
IRA, I HEARD SOMETHIN'.
I GOTTA RUN IT
BY SOMEBODY, OKAY ?
YEAH.
HEY.
T, COME ON.
TELL ME.
WHAT IS IT ?
MR. BARRET THINKS
THERE MIGHT BE
AN INSIDE PLAYER INVOLVED...
IN ELISE'S KIDNAPPING.
OH.
THAT ONE OF US
MIGHT BE IN ON IT.
OH, JESUS.
JUST CALM DOWN.
IT COULD BE BULLSHIT.
IT'S GOTTA BE, RIGHT ?
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,
HE'S PROBABLY TRYING TO
THROW US OFF GUARD.  FACT.
WAIT.  WAIT, THOUGH.
HEY, THIS IS GOOD.
NOW, JUST HEAR ME OUT.
IF IT IS TRUE,
WE COULD FIGURE OUT
WHO THE RAT IS.
AND THEN--
LISTEN.
THEN MAYBE WE COULD
SCORE SOME POINTS
WITH CHARLIE, YOU KNOW ?
THEN MAYBE
HE WON'T KILL US.
HE'LL JUST LET US OFF
WITH A-A-A...
WARNING OR SOMETHING.
WHAT ?
IRA, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
TELLING ANYONE
UNTIL I FIGURE THIS OUT.
HEY.  HEY.  BUDDY,
IT'S ME, ALL RIGHT ?
T.K. AND I HAVE
DISCUSSED THIS...
"INSIDE PLAYER" NOTION.
AND I JUST WANT
YOU TO KNOW THAT...
I AM ON TOP OF IT.
OKAY ?
I AM ON TOP OF IT.
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.
YEAH ?  I WON'T
DISAPPOINT YOU.
KISS-ASS.
SO ANYWAY,
DON'T WORRY.
IF THERE IS
A SNAKE IN THE GRASS,
I WILL SMOKE HIM OUT,
BECAUSE THAT IS
JUST INTOLERABLE.
IRA,
YOU ARE THE MAN.
THANK YOU, SIR.
STOP !
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
THE FIREPLACE.
YEAH ?
IT'S COZY.  ALSO,
I WANT TO BE NEAR BRETT.
ALL RIGHT.
COME...
IN FRONT OF THE FIRE.
HI, BRETT.
WHAT'S UP ?
WHAT--  GET--
GET OFF OF HIM !
JESUS !
YOU SOUND PRETTY DESPERATE.
I NEED TO FIND A WAY TO GET
IN TOUCH WITH THESE ASSHOLES.
MARTY, I DON'T ANSWER QUESTIONS.
I'D NEVER ASK NORMALLY,
BUT MAYBE ONE OF YOUR GIRLS
KNOWS SOMETHING.
I MEAN, IF I DON'T, I--
IT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD.
I THINK HE MIGHT DIE.
I MEAN, WELL--
I'VE BEEN WITH CHARLIE
FOR 20 YEARS.
I CAN'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO HIM.
I OWE HIM.
I DO TOO.
I WAS A KID WHEN I MET HIM.
????
IT WAS THE '70s.
WE WERE HIGH ALL THE TIME.
-WHEN I MET CHARLIE, I WAS WITH
THIS SCUMBAG, NICK THE NOSE.
- OH, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL !
WHAT A JERK.  I WAS FUCKING NICK
UP, DOWN AND SIDEWAYS FOR--
I DON'T KNOW-- THREE YEARS,
AND HE COULDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT COLOR MY EYES WERE.
WHEN I WALKED IN, THE FIRST
THING HE NOTICED WERE THESE
SHOES I JUST GOT...
-FROM BERGDORF'S WITH 500 BUCKS
THAT SHOULD'VE GONE TO HIM.
- COME HERE.
COME HERE.  COME ON.
STILL LOOK BRAND NEW.
????
TELL YOU WHAT.
WHEN WE FINISH UP HERE--
GONNA TAKE YOU
FOR A LITTLE RIDE...
-
HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.
- TO BERGDORF'S.
-
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
- I GO RIGHT PAST THERE.
DROP HER OFF.
I DON'T THINK SO.
I KNEW RIGHT THEN AND THERE
THREE YEARS WITH THIS GUY
MEANT NOTHING.
THEN CHARLIE WALTZES IN
LIKE A WHITE KNIGHT.
BUT NICK ISN'T
LETTING ME OFF THAT EASY.
HE WANTS HIS POUND OF FLESH.
I CAN'T HELP NOTICING.
THAT'S A HELL OF A RING.
YEAH.
IT'S NICE.
-CHARLIE SAVED MY LIFE.
HE TRADED HIS RING FOR ME.
- I NOTICED YOU NOTICING.
NICKY... LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S FOR YOU.
NO, I COULDN'T--
NO, IT'S A GIFT.
?? USED TO LIFT HER FACE
AND TELL HER ??
- AND THE NEXT DAY, I GOT
A PACKAGE FROM BERGDORF'S.
- FROM BERGDORF'S.
????
SO, WHATEVER HAPPENED...
-TO NICK THE NOSE ?
-WELL, CHARLIE
GOT HIS RING BACK.
NICK.
HEY, CHARLIE,
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU--
?? HE DIDN'T DROP
NO AMP BEFORE ??
?? BUT I DON'T PLAY
'ROUND HIM ANYMORE ??
?? IF I GET TO HEAVEN
I'LL LOOK FOR GRANDMA ????
IF I HAD TO LOOK...
I'D START HERE.
YEAH.
I THINK I GOT AN IDEA
HOW WE MIGHT GET AHOLD
OF THESE ASSHOLES.
THEY'RE LAUNDERING THE MONEY
THROUGH BARRIO BENNIE.
OKAY.
DON'T TOUCH THESE FUCKIN'
BUTTONS !  WHAT DID I TELL YOU ?
SORRY.  SORRY.

A CERTAIN WAY.

THEY DID THE SAME THING
TO ELISE.
YOU THINK THEY HURT HER
WHEN THEY DID THAT ?
DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T, MAN.
DON'T DO THAT
TO YOURSELF.
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
I KNOW IT.
YEAH.

I SAW YOU LOOKIN' OUT OF
THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE.
I LIKE THE BOOTS.

YOU GOTTA BE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
IT'S NOT LIKE SNAKESKIN.
SNAKESKIN, YOU GRAB A GUN,
YOU GO IN THE DESERT,
YOU WHACK A FUCKIN' SNAKE.
YOU CAN KILL A SNAKE WITH
A FUCKIN' STICK.  THIS GUY
HAS TO RENT THE BOAT,
HE'S GOTTA GET THE DIVING
EQUIPMENT, HE'S GOTTA RENT
ONE OF THOSE HARPOON THINGS...
THAT YOU SHOOT THE FISH WITH,
HE'S GOTTA GUT IT--
IT'S AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS.
I SHOULD'VE PAID $5,000.
I GOT A GREAT FUCKIN' DEAL.
FUCKIN' SHAME.
THAT'S IT.
I'M GONNA DROP YOU OFF.
THIS IS LIKE HAVIN' MY
MOTHER-IN-LAW IN THE CAR.
I THINK I'M DONE ON THIS SIDE.
SEEN A GUY IN VEGAS, MAN.
MAN, HE COULD DO SOME TRICKS.
- JESUS.
WHAT, DID YOU READ IT ?
- YEAH.  TWICE.

I'M GONNA DIE OF BOREDOM.
HOW ABOUT WE

THAT'S A SHAME, MAX.
YOU KNOW, FORGIVE ME SAYING SO,
BUT COULD IT BE,
THIS IS NOT YOUR NIGHT ?
-HEH !  YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.
-YOU EVER SEND A GUY A NEWSPAPER
WITH A DEAD FISH IN IT ?
- SHUT THE FUCK UP, MAN !
- AH, YOU GOT ME MIXED UP WITH
SOMETHING FROM THE MOVIES.
-PEOPLE MAKE THAT MISTAKE.
IT MUST BE MY CLASSIC PROFILE.
- IRA, SHUFFLE THE CARDS RIGHT.
- I AM.
- YOU SAID YOU WERE PRACTICING.
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE ?
WE'RE PLAYIN' A GAME.
- MONKEY-FUCKIN' FOOTBALL.
BRETT.  JOIN US.
TAKE A CHAIR.
- PASS.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU MIGHT
ENJOY YOURSELF ?  IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE ALLOWED.
I DON'T WANNA PLAY WITH YOU,
CHARLIE.    SORRY.
- REST OF YOU FAGS WANNA PLAY,
GO AHEAD.  HAVE FUN.
- THANKS, BRETT, THAT'S--
NO FRATERNIZING, EH ?
OH, WELL.  HAVE IT YOURWAY.
OKAY, BRETT'S OUT.
FIVE-CARD DRAW.
SAY, ACES, DEUCES,
ONE-EYED JACKS
AND SUICIDE KINGS ARE WILD.
- IRA, THAT'S THE WHOLE DECK.
- SO WHAT ?  IT'S MY GAME,
MY RULES.
IRA, THERE'S NO CHALLENGE
IN THAT.  THAT'S LIKE--
GENTLEMEN, KEEP IN MIND THAT
THE CARDS YOU HOLD IN YOUR HANDS
ARE NOTHING BUT DUMB LUCK.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINNING
AND LOSING IS BEING ABLE
TO READ YOUR OPPONENT.
THAT'S WHY I'M STILL HERE.
A NUMBER OF TIMES THE ONLY THING
KEPT ME OUT OF A SATIN BOX...
WAS I COULD SIZE UP THE
OTHER GUY MAYBE HALF A SECOND
QUICKER THAN HE COULD ME.
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT ?
YOU'RE TAPED TO A CHAIR.
YOU SAW US COMIN' A MILE AWAY
AT THE PLAZA, DIDN'T YOU ?
I ADMIT...
I'M OUT OF PRACTICE.
IRA... GIVE ME FOUR CARDS.
OH, SORRY, SIR.
NO OFFENSE.
- WELL, YOU GAVE ME SIX.
- TAKE IRA, FOR EXAMPLE.
I TRUST IRA.
- YOU DO ?
- WE'RE PLAYIN' POKER.
HE'S LOSIN' HIS SHIRT.
YET, IRA'S EYES DON'T FLOAT.
HE'S GOT HIS SENSE OF FAIR PLAY.
AS WE ALL KNOW,
IRA CAN'T BLUFF HIS WAY
OUT OF A PAPER BAG.
I CAN TELL YOU HIS BET
BEFORE HE COULD.
WELL, COULD YOU ?
'CAUSE I COULD USE
THE HELP HERE, CHARLIE.
LOOK AT AVERY.
HE'S HAVIN' A TOUGH TIME
HATIN' ME.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A REAL HATE-ON TO DO
WHAT YOU DID TO ME.
INTEGRITY KEEPS GETTIN'
IN AVERY'S WAY.
NOW HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE
HE'S A MIND READER.
- THAT'S RIGHT.
-  I FOLD.
- IRA, NO ONE OPENED.
- SORRY.
- I'LL OPEN.
- THAT MAKES SENSE.
- FOLD.
- THAT ALSO MAKES SENSE.
HOW ABOUT BRETT,
CONTROL JUNKIE ?
BRETT CAN'T LEAVE
ANYTHING TO CHANCE.
LOOK AT HIM.
HE WOULDN'T EVEN PLAY,
UNLESS HE'S LOOKING ACROSS
THE TABLE AT A SURE THING.
I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS SHIT.
I'M OUTTA HERE.
I THOUGHT HE'D NEVER LEAVE.
YOU'RE 180 OFF ON BRETT.
HE'S A WILD MAN.
WE'RE IN ATLANTIC CITY,
I HAD TO LOCK HIM IN A ROOM.
WHAT HAPPENED ?  HE DROPPED
A COUPLE OF QUARTERS
IN THE SLOTS ?
-
- HUH !  ABOUT 48,000 QUARTERS.
WE DROVE DOWN TO JERSEY
ON MEMORIAL DAY.
- LABOR DAY.
- UH--
WHATEVER.  JUST SHUT UP,
OKAY ?  I'M TRYIN' TO TELL
A STORY HERE.
- IRA.
- WHAT ?
YOU CAN'T TELL A STORY HERE.
YOU CAN'T TELL A STORY ANYWHERE.
YOU SCREW IT UP EVERY TIME.
- NO, I DO NOT.
- YOU'RE DOING IT NOW.
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU GUYS
INTERRUPT EVERY TIME.
I CAN'T KEEP MY PLACE.
I FORGET WHERE I WAS.
IF YOU GET THE GODDAMN
STORY STRAIGHT,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO INTERRUPT YOU TO GET
THE GODDAMN STORY STRAIGHT.
- WELL, IS SOMEBODY GOING
TO TELL A STORY ?
- I WAS TELLING THE STORY !
JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP.
I'LL TELL IT.
YOU FUCK IT UP EVERY TIME.
IT WAS LABOR DAY, IRA,
LIKE T.K. SAID.
IT WAS SCORCHIN' OUTSIDE,
IT WAS SO FUCKIN' HOT.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER THAT ?
THE ROOM WAS FREEZIN' THOUGH.
YOU COULD HANG MEAT IN THIS
ROOM, IT WAS SO DAMN COLD.
IT WAS GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
IT KEEPS YOU AWAKE.
WE'RE POUNDIN' SAUCE.
FREE BOOZE.
WHAT THEY LOSE ON THAT...
THEY MAKE UP
ON JOHNNY WALKER JUDGMENT.
IT'S GETTIN' REALLY LATE.
THE SUN'S ABOUT TO COME UP.
WE'D ALL LOST OUR SHIRTS.
MAXED OUT THE PLASTIC.
EXCEPT FOR BRETT.
BRETT'S WINNIN',
LIKE, HUGE.
THAT'S WHEN IT HAPPENED.
CHANGING OF THE GUARD.
NO-O-O !
WORD HAD IT THEY BROUGHT
THIS GUY IN FROM VEGAS
AFTER TWO SUICIDES.
IT'S THE GUY THEY BROUGHT
IN TO COOL THE TABLE DOWN.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL HIM ?
HELLO, BOYS !
THE WIDOWMAKER.
WHAT A LITTLE SHIT
THIS GUY WAS.
IT'S LIKE THE KID
THAT REMINDS THE TEACHER
ABOUT THE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.
OH !
WELL, THAT'S THIS KID
GROWN UP.
ANYWAY, BRETT'S 22 GRAND AHEAD,
SO I FIGURE IT'S SAFE
TO GO TO THE JOHN, RIGHT ?
WRONG.  GONE FIVE MINUTES,
I COME BACK, HE'S DOWN 12.
I TRY TO TALK HIM INTO
CHANGING TABLES, BUT HE
TAKES OUT A MARKER.
YOU FUCKIN' BELIEVE THAT ?
OH-H-H !
RIGHT THEN AVERY WALKS UP.
HE'S JUST GOT DONE SWEATIN' OUT
THE GEORGETOWN-MISSISSIPI GAME,
BUT AT TEN TO ONE,
HE'S COME OUT FIVE GRAND AHEAD.
HE TAKES ONE LOOK AT THIS LITTLE
WIMP, AND HE DUMPS HIS FIVE Gs
RIGHT ON TOP OF BRETT'S ACTION.
THESE CLOWNS, THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE THE WIDOWMAKER'S BALLS HOME
AND HIS LUGGAGE WITH ONE HAND.
SO WHAT DOES
BRETT THE GENIUS DO ?
HE DOUBLES DOWN !
WIDOWMAKER LOOKED HIM
RIGHT IN THE EYE,
AND HE DREW ONE CARD.
WHOA-HO-HO-HO-HO !
SORRY !
I'M SORRY.
GIMME THE MONEY !
THE GUY, HE'S--
HE'S GOT ROCKS
THE SIZE OF RUSHMORE.
OH, COME ON GUYS !  DON'T LEAVE.
WEREN'T WE JUST HAVIN'
A GOOD TIME ?  COME ON !
COME ON, COME ON !
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA !
AFTERWARDS, BRETT TAKES
HIS LAST 200 BUCKS,
HE TAKES US ALL OUT FOR STEAKS
THE SIZE OF YOUR FOOT.
WHAT A GUY.
HE DROPS 20 GRAND, HE AIN'T GOT
MONEY LEFT FOR A BUS TICKET
HOME, HE TAKES YOU FOR STEAKS.
IT MUST BE NICE
TO HAVE RICH FOLKS.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIS FATHER.
HE'S GOT THE FIRST NICKEL
HE EVER MADE.
SO, HOW'S HE GONNA PAY BACK
THE 20 LARGE ?
THE INTEREST ALONE IS ENOUGH
TO GIVE YOU A NOSEBLEED.
WHAT ?
MY ARM, IT'S KILLING ME.
LOOSEN THE TAPE.
IT'S FALLING OFF.
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
HOW YA FEELIN' ?
THAT'S IT.
OOH !  YEAH.
YEAH ?
COUPLE MINUTES.
TRY TO KEEP IT LEVEL.
OOH, YEAH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ?
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOIN' ?
NO, NO, NO !
HEY !
- NO !
- YOU FUCKER !  I WAS SITTIN'
ON A STRAIGHT FLUSH THERE !
BRETT, WILL YOU RELAX ?  HE
DOESN'T HAVE THE BLOOD PRESSURE
TO WALK AROUND THE ROOM !
LOOK AT HIM !
WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT ?
WE HAD A FUCKIN' PLAN !
THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT !
I WANT TO STICK TO THE PLAN !
- UH, MAYBE THAT'S NOT ALL
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT, HUH ?
- WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN ?
GO AHEAD, T.K.
ASK HIM.
ASK ME WHAT ?
ASK ME WHAT ?
GO ON, T.K.  T.K. !
SHUT UP !
ASK ME WHAT ?
JUST ANSWER THIS QUESTION,
OKAY ?
ALL THAT MONEY IN ATLANTIC CITY
THAT YOU LOST-- HOW WERE YOU
GONNA PAY IT BACK ?
- YEAH, HOW WERE YOU
GONNA PAY THAT BACK, HUH ?
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.  WHY ?
WELL, YOU SEE,
IT'S BEEN BROUGHT
TO CHARLIE'S ATTENTION...
THAT ONE OF US MIGHT BE
IN ON ELISE'S KIDNAPPING.
WHAT ?
YEAH.
WELL, THAT'S HOW I FELT.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT CRAZY.
AND, UH, $20,000
IS A LOT OF MONEY.
SO, IF YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO HIDE, YOU SHOULD HAVE
NO PROBLEM TELLING US...
HOW YOU WERE GONNA
PAY IT BACK, RIGHT ?
IRA, YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
LISTEN:  SHUT THE FUCK UP !
SHUT UP !
- HE SOUNDS GUILTY TO ME.
- IRA !
-FUCKIN' FAGGOT !  COME HERE !
- HEY, HEY, HEY !
HEY, BRETT !  COME ON !
AVERY, AVERY.  OOH.
DON'T TELL ME...
YOUR BUYIN' INTO THIS FUCKIN'
LOAD OF BULLSHIT !
HE'S MAKIN' UP STORIES
TO SAVE HIS OWN ASS !
LOOK, YOU CALM DOWN,
ALL RIGHT ?
I DON'T THINK THAT
ANYBODY HERE IS INVOLVED IN
ELISE'S KIDNAPPING, ALL RIGHT ?
BUT I THINK THAT IT
MIGHT BE TIME THAT WE
REVALUATE OUR PLAN.
WHY ?  THE PLAN'S WORKING, MAN.
HE FUCKING MADE THE CALL.  WHY ?
I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST LET CHARLIE GO.
- ME TOO.
- IRA, SHUT THE FUCK UP.
HE'S NOT DOIN' SO WELL.
WE SHOULD GET HIM TO A HOSPITAL.
WHAT THE FUCK ?  I LEAVE
THE ROOM, YOU GUYS ROLL OVER
LIKE FIVE-DOLLAR WHORES.
YOU HAVE A DRINK WITH THE GUY,
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
HE'S BEST MAN AT YOUR WEDDING.
WHAT THE FUCK DID HE DO ?
SPRINKLE FAIRY DUST UP
YOUR SKIRTS ?  COME O--
AVERY.  AVERY !
BUDDY, MAN--
THIS IS YOUR SISTER'S LIFE
WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT, MAN.
WHAT THE FUCK ?
MAN, LOOK AT US.
WE CUT HIS FUCKIN' FINGER OFF !
MAN, YOU'RE WALKIN' AROUND
WITH A GUN !
THIS ISN'T US.
WE'RE NO BETTER THAN HE IS.
TELL ELISE THAT.
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH ELISE'S KIDNAPPING.
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ?
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING !
IT DOESN'T MATTER !  WHOEVER
DID THE ACTUAL KIDNAPPING--
IT'S A FUCKING TECHNICALITY !
- GO AHEAD.  LOOK THAT UP
IN THE CONSTITUTION.
- MAX, SHUT UP.
BRETT, HE'S NOT GUILTY.
BUT HE'S RESPONSIBLE, MAN.
COME ON.
LET ME TELL YOU, THE BEST SOAP
IN THE WORLD WON'T WASH THE SCUM
OFF THIS GUY'S HANDS.
I PROMISE.
LET ME ENLIGHTEN YOU, AVERY,
ABOUT YOUR NEW FRIEND
HERE CHARLIE; ABOUT WHAT
HE'S REALLY LIKE.
YOU WANT TO TELL HIM ABOUT
THE DOGS OR SHOULD I ?
NO, YOU'RE DOING GOOD.
JUMP IN ANY TIME.
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
CHARLIE HAD A HOUSE IN JERSEY.
HE MOVES IN.  NEXT-DOOR
NEIGHBORS HAVE DOGS.  TWO DOGS ?
THEY'RE BARKIN' ALL NIGHT LONG.
CHARLIE GOES OVER, THE NICE GUY
THAT HE IS, ASKED THEM
TO KEEP THE NOISE DOWN.
NEXT NIGHT AFTER THAT, SAME
FUCKIN' DOGS-- BARK, BARK, BARK.
ALL FUCKIN' NIGHT LONG.
NEXT NIGHT AFTER THAT
AND THE NEXT NIGHT AFTER THAT,
UNTIL ONE NIGHT--
NOTHIN' MAN.
SILENCE.
NO MORE NOISE.
COPS GOT THERE ABOUT A WEEK
LATER.  THE DOGS WERE FINE.
HAPPIER THAN PIGS IN SHIT,
MUNCHIN' ON TOP SIRLOIN.
THE NEIGHBORS--
AVERY, THE NEIGHBORS--
THEY NEVER FUCKIN' FOUND.
OKAY ?  GONE.
HOW AM I DOIN', CHARLIE ?
IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT ?
-ALMOST.
-BET THAT WAS A RUMOR.  HE'S NOT
INVOLVED WITH THE MOB ANYMORE.
OH, GIVE ME A FUCKIN' BREAK !
HOW DO YOU THINK HE WAS ABLE...
TO FIND YOUR SISTER
WITH ONE PHONE CALL ?
COINCIDENCE ?
COME ON.
YOUR FRIEND IS RIGHT.
IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.
I WAS ABLE TO CONTACT
THE RIGHT PEOPLE,
THE WAY YOU COUNTED ON.
IT'S A GOOD THING FOR YOU
THAT I AM WHO I AM AND I DO
WHAT I DO AND I KNOW WHO I KNOW,
OTHERWISE, YOUR PRINCESS
WOULD BE CHOPPED UP
AND IN THE BLENDER BY NOW.
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHIN' ELSE:
EVEN AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO ME,
I KEPT MY PART OF THE BARGAIN.
NO MORE.
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DEALING WITH ?
GUESS AGAIN.  YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT ELSE I COULD DO
WITH ONE PHONE CALL ?
HOW ABOUT I HAVE YOUR ASS
MADE INTO MINCEMEAT ?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IN FACT
HAPPENED WITH MY NEIGHBORS.
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH BARKING DOGS.
THAT FAMILY, WAY BACK,
DID SOMETHING...
VICIOUSTO MINE.
EVERYTHING YOUR PAL BRETT
SAID IS TRUE,
EXCEPT HE LEFT OUT
ONE DETAIL:
THOSE DOGS--
IT WAS NOT STEAK
THEY WERE EATING.
GUYS, IT'S FOR HIM.
CHARLIE, YOU THERE ?
YEAH.
GOOD NEWS:  THE TERMS
HAVE BEEN OFFERED AND ACCEPTED.
THESE GUYS ARE GONNA MAKE SURE
THE MONEY IS IN PLAY,
THAT I'M GONE...
AND NOBODY'S WATCHING US,
AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA
DROP THE GIRL OFF...
AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM
AT THE LENNOX HILL HOSPITAL.
YOU GOT THAT ?
I'LL BE FRONTING YOU THE MONEY.
I KNOW YOU'RE GOOD FOR IT.
REMEMBER, THE BANKS
DON'T OPEN TILL 10:00,
SO DON'T GO DYING ON ME.
REMEMBER, I'M A LAWYER.
I GOT FRIENDS IN HELL.
SO, WHAT ?
IS IT STILL A GO,
OR WHAT ?
ONE SECOND.
YOU WANNA PLAY... STILL ?
GOOD.
NOW WE PLAY MY WAY.
I GIVE MY FRIEND THE GO-AHEAD.
YOU TELL HIM WHERE WE ARE.
I WANT MY OWN DRIVER
WAITING OUTSIDE THAT DOOR.
SO'S YOU GOT NO OPPORTUNITY
WHATSOEVER--
CRAP OUT
ON YOUR PART OF THIS.
- FORGET IT.  YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO TRUST US.
- NO.  YOU TRUST ME.
WELL, HOW 'BOUT
SOMETHING NEARBY ?
- YEAH, NOT HERE.
- A HOTEL.
YEAH, GOOD.
HMM ?
RESTAURANT.  GAS STATION.
NO COMMENT ?
MARTY,
CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF.
- NO.  NO, PLEASE.
- MIDDLEBURY INN.
IT'S A HALF-MILE AWAY.
IT'S IN MONTAUK.
IT'S GOT A COFFEE SHOP.
MIDDLEBURY INN.
MONTAUK.  GOT THAT ?
- THE MIDDLEBURY INN.
OKAY, SO HOW DO I GET THERE ?
- HOW DO YOU GET THERE ?
YEAH, IT'S EASY.  HI, SIR.
YEAH, TAKE 124th STREET TO--
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.  WHY SHOULD
HE GO THROUGH THAT KIND OF
TRAFFIC ?  PUT HIM ON THE, UH--
THERE'S NO TRAFFIC AT THIS HOUR.
TAKE 2nd AVENUE
TO THE MIDTOWN TUNNEL.
JUST SHUT UP, SHUT UP.
WHO DO YOU GOT THERE ?
THE NEW YORK
TAXI DRIVERS' UNION ?
TAKE CENTRAL PARK WEST
TO PARKWAY CENTRAL TO LENNOX
THEN TO 125th;
THE CENTRAL PARK EXPRESSWAY
OR THE SOUTHERN STATES.
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.
YOU GOT THAT ?
YEAH, I GOT IT.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
BROTHER.
HUH.
GOOD.
SO, SHE'S OKAY ?
YEAH.
THANK YOU,
MR. BARRET.
ANYTIME, KID.
I MUST SAY THAT THOSE WERE
TERRIFIC DIRECTIONS, MAX.
TURNS OUT YOU'RE SOME KIND
OF EAGLE SCOUT.  I HAD NO IDEA
YOU SPENT THAT MUCH TIME UPTOWN.
I USED THE LIBRARY UP THERE
AT COLUMBIA.
YOU GOT BALLS, KID.
I'D HATE TO GET STUCK UP THERE
ALONE, ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT.
IT HAPPENED TO ME ONCE.
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I STARTED OUT...
DO YOU MIND ?
TAKING BETS,
MAKING COLLECTIONS FOR NUMBERS.
ALL OF THE FIVE BOROUGHS.
I RAN MY ASS OFF.
I KNEW EVERY STREET UPSIDE
DOWN AND BACKWARDS,
BUT I'D NEVER BEEN
THAT FAR UPTOWN BEFORE.
I FELL ASLEEP ON A SUBWAY
AND MISSED MY STOP.
I COME OUT, I LOOKED AROUND.
TO ME IT WAS LIKE...
I LANDED ON, UH--
WHAT MAX SAID--
THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.
YEAH.
I'M SORRY.
I'D LOVE TO SIT AROUND
AND REMINISCE,
BUT COULD SOMEONE
TELL ME THE POINT
OF THIS FUCKIN' MEMOIR ?
WELL, I'M WONDERING HOW COME
A DAY AND A HALF AGO,
MAX CAN'T NAVIGATE
HIS WAY AROUND HARLEM
WITH A SHERPA GUIDE,
BUT TONIGHT HE KNOWS THE PLACE
LIKE HIS BACKYARD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.
WHAT I SAID.
HOW COULD YOU GET LOST UP THERE,
AS WELL YOU KNOW THE PLACE ?
ISN'T THAT WHERE YOU WERE
WITH THE GIRL
WHEN THIS HAPPENED ?
YEAH ?  SO ?
LIKE I SAID, IT WAS DARK OUT.
IT WAS RAINING.
- IT HAPPENED TO YOU.
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.
- I WAS EIGHT AT THAT TIME.
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE BACKIN'
THIS INSIDE PLAYER THING.
I'M BLEEDING TO DEATH.
HUMOR ME.
- YOU WANNA WASTE YOUR BREATH ?
GO AHEAD.
- WELL, ONE MORE QUESTION--
-HOW'D THEY KNOW
TO FIND YOU THERE ?
- HOW THE FUCK SHOULD I KNOW ?
WE'VE BEEN ALL THROUGH THIS
WITH THE POLICE.  I DON'T SEE
HOW SAYING IT ONE MORE TIME...
IS GONNA HELP ANYBODY.
COPS CAN'T FIND THEIR DICK
WITH BOTH HANDS.
OR, MAYBE IT HAPPENED
DIFFERENTLY.
WHAT DO I KNOW ?
I'M OLD.  I'M TIRED.
I'M A SENIOR CITIZEN.

BLOOD LOSS TO THE BRAIN.

FOR ANYBODY.
ALSO, THEY TELL YOU IF YOU DO
WHAT THEY SAY, NOBODY GETS HURT.

SO, YOU KNOW,
I LET IT RIDE.
BY THE END OF THE DAY,
I WAS INTO ANTOINE
FOR 50,000.

NEEDED HIS HELP.  HE DID IT
FOR ME.  IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.
