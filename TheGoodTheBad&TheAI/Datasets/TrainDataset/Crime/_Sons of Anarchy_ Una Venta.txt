ELI: Clock is ticking on
the eminent domain buyout.
He loses his investors, the
vote goes back to city council.
They can revert
back all the land.
ALVAREZ: Clay,
Jax-- Romero Parada.
JAX: - SIG 551s...
LUIS: - These are excellent.
Let's set up a shipment
for every two weeks.
ROMEO: I'll have the coke ready
for you for the run back.
JAX: That you forgot to mention we'd also
be running coke for the Galindo Cartel?
It's the only way
this thing passes.
JAX: If I do this, my
out for your drugs.
GEMMA: You hiding
something from me?
This fell out of one of
Abel's coloring books.
Letters from John Teller
would be very painful.
Could set things off
with Clay again.
PINEY: And all those other
drones at the table, they're
gonna follow him right down
to that last little crumb.
CLAY: You don't tell
me what we do.
JAX: Just jotting
some things down.
TARA: You really going down
there for a bike show?
CLAY: Opie and Kozik
headed up north.
GEMMA: - Irish?
CLAY: - Yeah.
ARMANDO: Welcome to
the border, brother.
- Good to see you, 'mano.
- Redwood.
HUFF: Having trouble
with the grip?
BOBBY: Really sorry
about Little Paul.
We wish we could have
made the funeral.
CLAY: So, uh, meeting Romeo
tomorrow at the expo, 10:00 a.m.
ARMANDO: SAMTAZ, ready
to protect and serve.
JAX: You're sure the truck's
good here tonight?
HUFF: Absolutely.
No cops, no scumbags.
That's a truck filled with
automatic weapons, douche bag, a
life sentence for everyone
involved, and you have us roll
Riding through this world all

CLAY: I ain't telling you how to run your
charter, but the club has precedents.
HUFF: SAMCRO went all
in with the cartel.
Now, that sends a message
to the charters.
CLAY: We don't deal.
That's always been the message.
ARMANDO: Come on, Clay,
that's bullshit, man.
You can't draw that line.
JAX: We just voted this shit in.
That trucker had back debt.
How long you been dealing?
ARMANDO: Voted it
in four months ago.
Been up and running about three.
This town is drying up, Clay.
I'm just trying to keep
this charter alive, man.
JAX: We would have never brought you
into this if we knew you were cooking.
HUFF: Look, you don't
want to use us, fine.
We're the closest
charter to the border.
Anybody else is a two-day ride.
CLAY: You know, we're paying
SAMTAZ a good fee for running
protection down here.
HUFF: Yeah, but SAMCRO's the only
charter getting rich off the cartel.
TIG: Sorry, guys,
Romeo's waiting.
We got to go.
CHIBS: Yeah, let's handle
this shit later, boys.
JAX: Why the hell did
Reggie turn in his patch?
Dude had 18 years.
BENNY: Little Paul
was his sponsor.
When he got killed,
it broke him up, man.
JAX: He got out before
the crank vote?
BENNY: Yeah, almost
five months ago.
JAX: Close vote?
BENNY: It was, but now
everyone's behind it now.
JAX: What about you?
BENNY: Four kids,
GEMMA: You sell
Mariposa lily bulbs?
RITA: I don't have any in
stock, but I can get some.
Half of mine never
make it from seed.
GEMMA: How's it going
with the gardens?
We don't raise another $80,000
in the next three weeks, it's gone.
More retail feed for
Charming Heights?
GEMMA: I wouldn't let the
mayor see that sign.
RITA: Just imagine what he'd do
if he knew I was the one who
We're having a big
fund-raiser next week.
GEMMA: I take it you
know who I am.
GEMMA: So what's this,
uh, gold circle club?
RITA: Oh, it's for premium donors,
minimum $5,000 donation.
RITA: There's other
ways to donate.
Gold circle is mostly
professionals.
Helps us attract
the right donors.
GEMMA: So, uh, being a biker's
old lady would what?
Attract the wrong
kind of donors?
RITA: I honestly don't
care who you are.
If you really want to
help, the door is open.
But if you're just here to rattle
my cage, I don't have the time, love.
I'll come back with
my dead bulbs.
POTTER: I seriously hope the clock
ticks out on Charming Heights.
POTTER: Well, if Hale doesn't
lock down investors heby the end
of the quarter, eminent domain
vote goes back to the city council.
POTTER: Thanks for
the light, Gem.
BOBBY: Romeo does not seem like
the kind of guy who runs late.
JAX: I've been thinking
about this crank move.
Armando said they passed
the vote four months ago.
That's right after Little Paul
was killed and Reggie quit.
CLAY: So, you think that had something
to do with this drug move?
JAX: Little Paul would have
never signed off on crank.
Him walking away doesn't
make any sense.
Two no's easily sway
it the other way.
TIG: Yeah, so someone's
clearing the opposition, man?
JAX: I don't know, but it's
worth tracking down Reggie,
We got to shut this
crank thing down.
Send the message to the other
charters we don't deal.
BOBBY: Every business needs
shipping and selling.
CLAY: I got a wife that says
shit without saying shit.
Muling and dealing--
same goddamn thing.
LUIS: He doesn't
like being watched.
CLAY: Oh, just some
local shit, man.
It's got nothing to do
with our business.
CLAY: This is your
goddamn crank.
HUFF: Hey, you're the
crew on federal release.
Could be the ATF with their
noses still up your ass.
Sooner we lose it, sooner
the Mexicans feel safe.
We'll take 'em down
to Vesper Trail.
TIG: You sure your
grip can handle this?
HUFF: That's how we do
in Mexizona, Mr. Crow.
POTTER: They blew
up a grease truck?
That doesn't sound
like our boys.
A little bit too Mad
Max, don't you think?
GRAD: We lost the goddamn tail.
POTTER: Pretty sure that
was their objective.
Did we get anything?
GRAD: Few photos.
It's not Parada.
POTTER: Pull Romeo's
military info.
I'm guessing you'll find this
guy was part of his unit.
Probably his second.
REGGIE: Bunny, get in the back.
It's all right, it's all right.
Just go in the back.
CLAY: Never pegged you for
an animal lover, Reg.
REGGIE: What do you want?
JAX: Just want to
say hello, man.
Missed you in SAMTAZ.
REGGIE: I'm out.
Good standing. Ink's all black.
BOBBY: - Why'd you walk away?
REGGIE: - None of your business.
Now, get out of here.
JAX: Come on, man.
BOBBY: - Oh, shit!
CHIBS: - No, no, no, no!
JAX: Weeks after Little Paul was
killed, SAMTAZ passed a crank vote.
That have anything to do
with why you patched out?
CLAY: Hey, Tig, you in
the mood for some stew?
TIG: Yeah, yeah.
Mmm, hasenpfeffer, man.
REGGIE: All right.
JAX: Why'd you quit?
REGGIE: Huff found out I was
banging Little Paul's old lady.
TIG: Ellen?
Jesus, man.
CLAY: So what happened?
REGGIE: Huff kept it quiet, said he
didn't want to ruin Paul's marriage.
CLAY: Saving it for leverage.
REGGIE: Little Paul and I got word there
was a cookhouse out on Copperhead.
Shook down the skinheads who
were running it, found out Huff
and Benny had set it up.
Used the club's weight to get it
done and nobody at the table had
any idea that it was happening.
Then we get a call from Huff and
Benny saying Little Paul had
been gunned down by
Mexican bangers.
No other witnesses.
JAX: And when you threatened to out
him, Huff played the leverage.
REGGIE: Yeah.
Huff said he was gonna tell the
gang that I was banging Ellen.
I'd be drummed out, Ellen'd get
shunned-- no compensation,
nobody to look out after her.
I didn't want it to
ruin her life, too.
I walked away.
BOBBY: Yeah, well, once you and Little
Paul were gone, Huff voted it in legit.
REGGIE: Look, I don't want
this getting back to the club.
CLAY: I can't make that promise.
I can promise you we'll
take care of Ellen.
JUICE: Yo, Luis called.
Romeo wants to meet.
CLAY: Uh, get a 20 on those
skinheads, will you?
TIG: Yeah.
TARA: Piney.
You okay?
PINEY: Yeah, I just-- sorry,
I, I just let myself in.
TARA: It's okay.
What's, uh, what's going on?
PINEY: Uh, you remember those
questions you were asking me a
few months back about John?
Then you said you
read something.
TARA: Yeah.
PINEY: What was it?
TARA: Well, you shut me down
when I tried to tell you.
Why do you want to know now?
PINEY: Because the club is
headed into troubled waters and
maybe there's something in
whatever you read, helps me to
keep the boat from, you
know, rocking too much.
TARA : Those are some
really vague metaphors for
a guy as direct as you.
PINEY: I want to
read whatever it is.
John was my friend.
I have a right.
TARA: Bullshit.
What do you need it for?
PINEY: I can't tell you.
TARA: Hmm, then neither can I.
PINEY: Hey.
I need some goddamn leverage.
- And that pointed history you
read may be... GEMMA: - Oh, sorry.
TARA : You know, most civil
people would knock before entering.
GEMMA: I'm not most people.
CHUCK: And she's
definitely not civil.
GEMMA: What are we,
George and Gracie now?
Sorry to interrupt.
PINEY: That's okay, we're done.
TARA: No, no, no, no.
We should finish.
I'll be right back.
What do you need?
GEMMA: I wanna sign you up for a
committee-- Charming Central Gardens.
Need to raise money to save it.
TARA: I can't. I'm already
on three committees here.
GEMMA: I just need your name.
It means a lot to get
a doctor involved.
- Attracts donors.
TARA: - Gemma, I can't.
GEMMA: It's a chance
to help this town.
TARA: What's your angle on this?
Why do you give a shit
about an overgrown park?
GEMMA: Nate taught me how to plant
seed in that overgrown park.
I am not gonna let 'em gut it
and put up a goddamn Starbucks.
CHUCKY: Tara, it's Piney.
S... Something wrong!
CLAY: Sorry about this morning,
man; won't happen again.
ROMEO: Who was it?
CLAY: Ah, local law.
Harassing one of our
charters down here.
We got it handled.
ROMEO: Good.
JAX: From now on, we'll just be sending
four guys down with the truck.
Lower profile.
Our Tucson charter will run
protection once we're here.
ROMEO: Have we heard from
our friends in Belfast?
CLAY: I talked to the Kings.
They're working on that
big ticket order for you.
They're gonna want a face-to-
face before that sale can happen.
ROMEO: I'm always available.
LUIS: We're all set.
LUIS: Location for the exchange, South
Tucson, farm equipment repair yard. 10:00.
CLAY: - Great. See ya then.
ROMEO: - See ya. Vámonos.
LUIS: We trust these guys?
ROMEO: Not till we need to.
GRAD: Luis Torres, Special
Forces Airmobile Group.
Masters in Logistics,
Universidad Veracruzana,
- Lieutenant First Class...
POTTER: - Commanding Officer,
Left Special Forces two
weeks after his C.O.
GRAD: Looks like
we're back on RICO.
POTTER: Just in time,
we're outta snacks.
Tell 'em all our players are
in the game and I need money.
POTTER: To the place
where bikers go to die.
ARMANDO: What the hell is
this all about, Clay?
We should be gearing
up for tonight.
About five months ago, Little
Paul and Reggie found
out Achey here was cooking
for Huff and Benny.
CLAY: They told his crew it
was a SAMTAZ drug operation.
JAX: Yeah, after you killed
Little Paul and blackmailed
ARMANDO: You know what
you're doing here?
CLAY: I'm accusing the VP and
the Sergeant of using the MC
And then when they got caught,
they killed a member...
blackmailed another.
BENNY: This is crazy, man.
This guy's a goddamn tweaker.
CHIBS: Yeah, but this guy's not.
Reg has the whole story.
CLAY: It's your charter, man.
Listen to the facts.
You make your decision.
But if you find out that your
club got into crank on a lie,
you need to vote it again.
HUFF: I'm not listening
to this shit.
ARMANDO: Sit down, Huff.
HUFF: You gonna listen
to his bullshit?
ARMANDO: I said sit down.
HUFF: You little bitch...!
CLAY: You having
trouble with the grip?
JAX: Handle your business.
We'll be at the truck stop.
PINEY : Can I
get out of here now?
TARA: Dr. Geller wants to
keep you in for 24 hours.
Just observation.
PINEY: It's my oxygen levels.
It happens once in a while.
TARA: The alcohol isn't helping.
PINEY: Yeah, I know.
I'm-I'm sorry I was so
hard on you before.
TARA: Mm, it's okay.
Tell me about John Teller.
What was he like?
PINEY: He was a complicated guy.
Angry, impulsive...
Just righteous as hell.
Hated being wrong.
Not much of an education.
Book smart, though.
He used to, um...
devour three and four of 'em at a time.
He was loyal.
Too loyal.
TARA: That sounds familiar.
PINEY: Yeah, they're cut
from the same cloth.
You know what I want to know?
Why my best friend was
afraid when he died.
TARA: I found some
of JT's old letters.
He was trying to get the club
out of the gun business.
He knew it was a risk.
Clay and the others
were invested.
PINEY: Trying to
get them out how?
TARA: From what I read, he had
set up a meeting in Belfast
with some IRA members
and a priest.
PINEY: - Kellan Ashby.
TARA: - Yes.
John wanted to end the
relationship with the Irish,
stop the club from selling guns.
He was killed before
that meeting happened.
GEMMA: Hey, how we doing?
TARA: Okay.
We're gonna run some more tests.
Make sure he's stable.
GEMMA: Just give him some
tequila, that'll do it.
TARA: I'll check
in on you later.
GEMMA: What you doing, old man?
What do you want with Tara?
PINEY: She's just, uh, helping
me grow old gracefully.
GEMMA: I know you're
bumping up against Clay.
That bullshit you fed
me the other day.
PINEY: It wasn't bullshit,
it was the truth.
You all just refuse
to look at it.
GEMMA: Well, whatever truth
you think Tara can tell you,
it's only going to
make things worse.
PINEY: - It can't get any worse.
GEMMA: - Back off it, Piney.
Leave it alone...
before it kills you.
PINEY: That's half the
reason I'm doing it.
JAX: Sorry, man.
ARMANDO: Lost a third
of my goddamn club.
BOBBY: Take another
vote on the crank?
ARMANDO: Yeah.
It passed. Sorry.
CLAY: Are you shitting me?
ARMANDO: Guys got a taste
of the money, Clay.
It was unanimous.
We'll arrange another
depot to land the truck.
And I'll make damn sure the
crank don't get in the way.
You got my word.
CLAY: Shit.
JAX: We better get moving.
ARMANDO: Come on.
CLAY: Not a goddamn word.
GEMMA: Sorry. I, uh, I just wanted
to stop by and give you this.
Gold circle club.
Five grand.
RITA: In 20s?
GEMMA: Is that a problem?
RITA: No.
Come on in.
I'll get your information.
GEMMA: Oh, no, no,
it's not for me.
Dr. Tara Knowles wants
to be on your committee.
Here's all her info.
Future daughter-in-law.
RITA: Lucky you.
GEMMA: Yeah-- lucky me.
My dead bulbs.
RITA:
GEMMA: Have a good night.
CLAY: That's some
well-guarded salsa, man.
ROMEO: Wait till you taste it.
CLAY: Chibs, come on, Chibs.
POTTER: I'm good.
Sorry to interrupt your
solitude, Mr. Delaney.
Deputy Sheriff Gabe Marcel, San
Joaquin Sheriff's Department.
Just, uh, need a few
minutes of your time.
It's regarding the murder of
your wife, Luann Delaney.
Sanwa Sheriffs recently took
over jurisdiction of Charming.
All of Charming P.D's unresolved
cases became our responsibility.
I'm following up.
According to the autopsy report,
traces of semen were found in
your wife's undergarments.
The county was finally
able to run the analysis.
Got a match from the system.
A, uh...
Robert Munson.
Known as Bobby Elvis.
A member of your
motorcycle club.
Can you tell me anything
about their relationship?
And I ask, because in most
cases, 87.9% actually, the
person having sex with the
victim is the perpetrator.
And... It was...
It was a gruesome assault.
I understand you've been going
through some emotional issues.
Doesn't seem right you're
locked up in this box.
I'm going to look into that.
I'll come back a little later when
you feel a bit more... settled.
Have a good night.
CLAY: You always travel this thick, or
you expecting heat from the competition?
ROMEO: It's just a precaution.
JAX: Should we be
taking that precaution?
ROMEO: Lobo Sonora doesn't
know about our deal.
If they did, they would never
risk reprisal up north.
LUIS: They hit us down
here, and we're prepared.
CLAY: That you are.
ROMEO: 700,000.
The balance for this order.
Half down for the next.
ROMEO : Fredo!
30 kilos of uncut
Colombian cocaine.
LUIS: Give it a safe
ride, gentlemen.
ROMEO: We'll be up in a few days
to check on the operation.
