- OK, Sid.
- Good luck to you.
- That just get weird?
- Yes, maybe a little.
- You remember this.
- Ah, my favorite car.
- You're kidding.
- Hey, this couch falls out.
This is the worst apartment
I've ever seen.
Hey, it's not much, but it's mine.
There's cable TV, everything.
- This is for me?
- No, it's for my other friend,
- who just got out of prison.
- Heh.
- Those were the days, my friend.
- Yeah.
- Except it's worse.
- It's not to your liking? Sorry.
- There's cable TV.
- Yeah, I know, you said that already.
I got Starz and Showtime,
and I was in fucking lockdown.
Can I use the commode
for like two seconds?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Good, I've been dreaming
about their coffee.
- Cause I could fucking party right now.
- No, I don't feel like partying.
I don't know what to tell you, Val.
I do the same thing everyday, I paint...
the sunrise, watch the cable TV,
try to eat right, relax, go to bed.
- And?
- I did anyway, she's working...
Oh, yeah? Didn't she have a kid?
Your granddaughter?
- I'm retired.
- You're retired.
- You know what I'm saying?
- Should we go to Miss D's?
- Yeah.
- This is Val.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey.
Oh, she couldn't take the cold,
so she set up shop in Florida, Boca.
- You look like her.
- Yeah?
- Bar Mitzvah.
- Ah...
- Coming out party, going in party.
- Yeah, I got the next best thing.
I think that's the party
I'm talking about, yeah.
- Happy parole.
- Follow me.
- Have a seat. Relax, relax.
- Thanks. Yeah.
- It's the same, but different.
- Huh.
Would you give my regards
to your mother, please?
- Hello.
- She's a beauty.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Nice...
- She is.
- Come on.
- Wanna have fun?
- I'm retired.
- We'll have fun.
- Trust me, case closed.
- Come on.
- Wendy...
Yeah, use... there's one...
there's one through there.
- Hey.
- That was quick.
- Yeah, didn't work.
- Something wrong?
- It's not good.
- No, not good.
- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
- We'll be back.
- You find it funny? Is this funny?
- Nuh... nuh... no, no, I just...
Do you have anything
that are good to help my friend out?
- It's okay.
- We'll come back.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Just keep smiling.
- We'll be back.
Guys, if you get back before seven,
I'll give you the "Early Bird Special."
- Now I thought you said you're retired.
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, that was just plain cruel.
- I'm sorry.
Remember that time you threw that Greek
out of the hotel window?
Oh, this is definitely
a violation of my parole.
It's OK, I need to fill
my Nexium prescription anyway.
- What's Nexium?
- It's for my ulcer.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh...
Ooh, Latanoprost.
My co-pay is insane on this one.
So how long does this take
to get the pipes working?
Three Andrew Jacksons say I, uh,
run this table.
But, uh, that would be
robbing Peter to pay Paul.
"Each one must give
as he has decided in his heart,"
- "not reluctantly or under compulsion."
- Uh-huh, Corinthians.
- Chapter nine, verse seven.
- I love Corinthians.
- Oh, it's on now.
- Oh, wait, let me get out of your way.
- Oh!
- See?
- Thank you.
- It's yours.
- Too easy, but I'm gonna take it.
- Oh, it is easy.
- Hello!
- Oh!
- That was not fair.
- No, it wasn't.
- You shouldn't have taken so many.
- Oh, fuck that.
- Are you ready, Val?
- Ooh, ah, whoa...
- Let us go.
- Oh, yes.
Next smile you see,
will be on Oxana's face.
- Aw...
- I'm coming in to use the phone, OK?
Paul, where's my
fucking Kung Pao Chicken?
- It's on it's way. You got a call.
- Fuck my ass. Gimme the phone.
then you won't be
a friend of mine any longer.
Do I have dementia? Paul, who's
the President of the United States?
- Um...
- Shut the fuck up!
What, like ten,
or later, like brunch time?
Kill him by 10 o'clock in the AM,
or you're dead too.
The only reason I've let you live
was for this. We clear?
- We're clear.
- Then good night.
- Everything all right?
- No, but thank you for asking.
Bet you're the type of man who wouldn't
let a lady drink by herself, huh?
Doc, my mother always told me to do the
best with what you have, where you are.
So, did everything work this time,
Valentine?
Four times. It worked. I coulda
gone again, but she's all worn out.
- Good for you.
- Come on, let's blow this pop stand.
- Me too.
- I feel so ready to party.
- Why embarrass yourself?
- Ah...
We're doing a battle of the balls. This
goes up and down like a fucking yo-yo.
- Can we go home now?
- Oh, no. Definitely not now.
- What are you doing, Val?
- Just give it to me, I'm not asking.
I want you to play
something a lil' different.
You know, like when music was still
music, when it had a lil' soul.
- Ah, ya talking old school.
- Old school, yeah.
Right, yeah, there's not much call
for old school around here.
- I think it could be.
- I can trust you, right? Slow.
- You can trust me.
- Don't let me down.
First of all, I just want to say,
it was rude, what I did.
- Yes.
- And I deserve everything you gave me.
- Mm-hmm.
- Lisa.
My friends call me Val,
and here's the situation.
I mean, where, I can't say, but
I really need you to dance with me.
Now, I'm not gonna ask you to go home
with me, I'm not gonna try to kiss you,
holdin' each other,
smiling at time, nothing else.
After that, you'll never see me,
or hear from me...
again. I promise.
How's that sound to you, Lisa?
- All right, Val.
- All right, that's good.

- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- come out of this shit.
- Nice.
Hey, hey, hey, listen, no drugs at
the bar. You want to do drugs, have the
- courtesy to take it to the bathroom.
- No, no, no, no, it's prescription.
No, no, no, listen,
what else can I get you guys?
- To go?
- Yeah.
- Uh, that's illegal.
- And this isn't?
- Here, let's make it legal.
- Okay.
- Isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.
- Stupid jerk.
- Strange.
- I know, Val.
- Let me talk for two fucking seconds.
- Thank you.
- Can I talk for two fucking seconds?
- I'm still hard, is that a problem?
- It is, actually.
- I feel kinda light-headed.
- It's all right.
- Ah...
- Let's get your leg in there.
- Oh, shit.
- It's all right.
¶¶ "How Long" ¶¶
¶¶ Performed by: Charles Bradley ¶¶
- Val, wake up.
- I'm up, I'm up.
- You OK?
- I don't think so.
Well, it's OK, you know.
You-you-you could... you could tell me.
- Doc, you there?
- Yeah.
I just wanna know if something's
gonna happen, that's all. I-I just...
I like to know what's gonna happen.
I like information, OK?
You're Hirschey's daughter.
Are you kidding me?
- I knew you when you was little.
- Yeah, time flies, right?
- What?
- I'm fucking dying.
- I'm so dizzy.
- Rest.
- Oh...
- Take a deep breath.
Relax, he's not dying. Doctor's
gonna be here in a couple of minutes.
- How is your father?
- His emphysema's pretty bad.
He's over at The Lighthouse Nursing Home
these days, ever since mom died.
- He's hanging in.
- For your 10th birthday, we were there.
- That was you?
- I threw you up in the air
I felt like I was flying.
I remember you catching me.
- Yeah, s-so what?
- What'd you do?
I'm supposed to answer that? Fuck, I-I-I
got like no blood in my brain any more.
- He had some bad luck is all.
- Oh, yeah, well, I know all about that.
- Excuse me.
- Yup.
- Take a quick look.
- Mm-hmm.
- How many pills did he take?
- A fistful.
- I see.
- Are you a real doctor?
Are you a real patient?
Is that a real penis?
Mr. Valentine, you have
what is called vein-induced priapism.
Now, I can give you some blood thinners
to open things up a bit, but, uh...
old blood's gotta be removed,
in order for fresh blood to flow in.
- Removed in what way, removed?
- What's he talk...
- Oh!
- Oh, fuck me.
What is this? Where are you going, Doc?
Where are you going?
- Oh, no, what are you doing?
- I'll be... I'll be in the waiting room
- Maybe I partied a lil' too hard.
- Maybe a little.
- I paid the bill.
- OK.
- Do what?
- You know what.
Let's just drop
the "welcome home" thing, OK? I know.
- Hey there, Doc.
- Hey, Alex.
- Who's your friend?
- This is my best friend...
Valentine. Alex,
he just got back from a long trip.
Oh it was... um, I'm just glad I'm back,
and I don't answer to the name Valentine
- My friends call me Val.
- OK, well, then I'll call you Val, Val.
- Well, then we're friends.
- Yeah, you can never have enough.
- Yeah, you're right, there.
- Doc and I, well, we've been friends
- for a while now, haven't we?
- We have.
I remember the very first time
he walked in here.
- You remember that?
- Sure I do.
I hate to break up this "remembering
the more wistful times", but...
- I'm-I'm a little on the peckish side.
- Sure, what'll it be tonight, fellas?
- Uh, a tea and lemon, please.
- OK.
All right,
how do you like your steak done, Val?
- Coming right up.
- Yeah.
- Enjoy your dinner, Ernie.
- Can I have a little more?
Every day I walk outta here,
I'm always better.
- It's you, isn't it.
- I don't know.
Whaddya think this is here, I'm gonna
blame you for anything? A job is a job.
If the roles were reversed,
I'd do it in a heartbeat.
- Bit of an understatement.
- Yeah.
I had my head on a swivel, you know,
I was looking here, looking there.
What the fuck is gonna happen,
and when is it gonna happen?
on the yard, or am I gonna get it
in the fucking cafetaria?
That's-that's all I thought about,
and then I understood somethin'.
the kid panics,
starts shooting everywhere...
- Could've been anybody's.
- I was there, I know.
I'm a fucking stand-up guy,
I took the fall for everyone.
And they pressed me.
I didn't say a word, not a fucking word.
- For 28 years, he was sittin' on you.
- Yes.
this is the best Surf n' Turf
I've seen in all my travels.
- Can I say that?
- That's very kind of you to say, Val.
- Are you OK, Doc?
- Yeah.
Oh, nope, this doesn't work.
What time is it now?
Hey, man, let's... Why don't we
skedaddle down the road a bit.
Surf n' Turf with a Root
Beer Float, you know...
- But if I run...
- What?
You're not gonna have
any friends any more.
- How's it better?
- It's better because...
- then I can say goodbye.
- I don't want you to say goodbye.
I have to say goodbye.
There's nothing left for me to say.
- Something has presented itself.
- What?
- beast of a car is this?
- Val, no.
I think she's lonely.
I think she wants us to take her out.
This car belongs to the Jargoniew
brothers. I happen to know them.
A-a-and that's supposed to
mean somethin' to me?
These are the type of guys,
take yer kidneys out, not even sell them
- with a coat hanger any more, Val.
- Says who?
What kinda asshole
keeps a car like this open?
These guys don't worry about
somebody stealing their car, Val.
- Come on.
- These guys, I'm telling you...
What the...
where does this fucking key go?
Yeah, well, my life
is full of "not good ideas."
- They make cars differently these days.
- Yeah, so you know how to do it?
- Put your foot on the brake.
- Yeah.
- And press that button.
- This button?
- Holy shit, fuck.
- Whoa...
- Our friend needs rescuing.
- Yes.
Whoa... I don't ever wanna end up
in one of these places.
- Hey, excuse me.
- Yeah?
Would you happen to know
where Richard Hirsch's room is?
- I like Hirsch. Are you his friends?
- Yeah, the best.
down at the end of the hall,
and to your left.
- Hey, are you here to rescue him?
- How'd you know?
- I feel like I'm dreaming.
- Hirsch.
You're still here. We're all still here.
You fucking guys, its like the old days.
- Get me outta here.
- Here.
- Yeah.
- Ah...
- Nada, let's roll.
- You better get dressed.
- Huh?
- Right here.
- Oh-ho.
- OK.
- There's no leg room here.
- Yeah.
The hell with your leg room.
I'm 6' 2", let's go.
- Ey.
- The situation is not ideal.
- You're a master.
- Yeah, I was.
- You are.
- I was.
- You don't forget that stuff.
- You're a master, Hirsch.
Four minutes ago,
you were sittin' in a dying house.
Now you're sittin' in this beast
of a car, you know. The situation's OK.
- Don't fuck around, gimme the key.
- It's new. It's a button.
- And it's automatic.
- You push the button.
- A button?
- It's computers.
- Is it here?
- Yeah.
You put-put your foot on the brake
at the same time.
- All right.
- OK?
- Yeah.
- Can we go now?
Well, it's a million dials here.
I never saw this before.
Whaddya been doing
since the last time I saw you.
- Ah, me too.
- A different kind, I guess.
Hey, I'm sorry for your loss.
Sorry about Julie.
- Yup.
- Uh... Whaddya say.
Well, they took something out of me
a couple of months ago.
I don't know. I didn't ask.
It's none of business.
But I'm a little more streamlined now,
a little more aerodynamic.
- Which way is the highway?
- Not the highway, Hirsch.
Which way is the highway?
I'm not gonna ask again.
- Go left.
- Go left, young man.
- Go left!
- Yo!
- So I got into gardening.
- Where? In the joint?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Julie was into that.
- No, yeah?
- Yeah.
- I'm not surprised.
- Whoa!
in order to get back in, so he could see
how his garden was going.
- Don't worry, I can lose 'em.
- I got paroled today.
We're driving in a stolen car,
and I imagine you're carrying a weapon.
- So?
- So...
Hirsch, remember the time
in that shitbox car, with the Chinaman?
- You do, huh?
- I do.
- Thanks.
- I mean, you still got it, buddy.
- Yeah, I do, don't I?
- Yeah, absolutely.
- That was intense. I got a rush.
- Hey, I threw up in my mouth.
- Today?
- Yeah.
- Get the hell outta here.
- No, yeah, ask Doc.
- No kidding.
- Yeah.
- We got sprung on the same day.
- It's nice you can share that.
- 28 years.
- 28 fucking years.
You did your time like a man, Val.
You're a stand-up all the way.
Well, you know,
you and Doc would have done the same.
It's possible, either way is possible,
but you did it, Val.
- all this time.
- Nope.
No, no, no,
Claphands retired us, that was that.
He can't forgive himself,
so everybody else has gotta pay.
Is there anything in this life,
that you haven't done...
that
you would like to have a chance to do?
- That's very doable, no, Doc?
- Yeah, done and done.
One more time,
you get the free coffee mug.
Wendy, we'd like you to meet
our associate, Richard Hirsch.
He's looking for, what is known
in French, as the "mÃ©nage Ã  trois."
...you're gonna have
the greatest experience of your life...
- Do you promise?
- I swear to God.
- Shouldn't it be double?
- Yeah, it should.
If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't believe it.
whatever he did,
he watched TV, he listened to the radio.
Now, he would atta... you know,
the attachment on a vacuum cleaner.
Now,
what do you call the thing that they...
- It's a nozzle.
- The nozzle.
Yeah, but it's like, for taking
the stuff off the corners of the couch.
- I mean why do you put your dick in it.
- It doesn't matter because
it stretched his dick, and his dick
kept getting bigger and bigger.
There's other ways. There's a
Chinese thing I heard about. It's a jar.
They put bees in it. You put it
on your schlong. The bees bite yer dick.
- Hello.
- It-it gets all swollen, huge.
- pipes still workin'?
- You could put it that way.
I do not know the
English word for what I feel.
- "Surprised"?
- I think it's called "lust," darling.
- "Love." That is close enough.
- Good, OK.
- I didn't know you had it in ya.
- I did.
- You've ruined me for any other man.
- It's OK, you'll get over it.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
- I don't feel that great.
- Why the fuck not?
I-I never went out on my wife before,
it makes me feel like a piece of shit.
Hirschey, for Christ's sakes,
she been dead for ages.
We were married for 40 fuckin' years!
You don't get over that in five minutes.

- What was that?
- Wait a minute.
Shit, man, it's the trunk.
Someone's in the trunk.
- OK, let's pull over.
- No, pull over. That's not good.
- So, we go on "three," right?
- Look how I'm doing this.
- Get the gag out, get the gag out.

- I'm a friend of yours. Put this on.
Hirsch, listen,
you're gonna have to give me your pants.
Because she's naked.
She's gonna need somethin' to wear.
I'm not giving her my pants.
End of story.
Come on, she's got no clothes on.
Give her your pants.
You wanna give her some pants?
Give her your pants.
I gave her my jacket. My pants are
important to me. Gimme, give, come on.
What makes you the arbiter
of whose pants are important,
You don't need pants.
You sit in the car driving. What the...
- How the fuck you need pants to drive?
- I don't need pants?
I gotta go out and walk around.
Come on, give...
I'm not giving her my fucking pants!
End of story.
- OK. So, that's your final offer?
- I'm not making any offers.
Song, how're you doing?
Do you sell women's clothing here?
My friend just asked you a question,
a polite question.
Ay, hijo chaqueta. You no hear so good,
old man, or you just stupid?
- See that?
- Hey, your jab still looks pretty good.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
I thought I...
I didn't get my hips into it.
- You need anything?
- Just my bill.
I think we should know
certain things about her.
- Feeling better?
- A little. Starvin'.
Ahem, so, Sylvia, why don't we, uh,
continue where we left off?
This car pulls up. Nice car. Nice smile.
Asked me if I needed a ride.
Wow, you know, you shouldn't
accept rides from strangers.
- Go fuck yourself, all right?
- Hoo, ah, OK.
There was another guy in the backseat
who I didn't see.
There were two other guys there.
They were just laughing, whatever.
Pretty soon, I was naked, and, uh,
figure out the rest.
- So you never saw these guys before.
- Never.
What do you think,
I put myself in the trunk?
Doc, I didn't know
you had so many friends.
Well, let me know
if I can get you anything else.
Now I'm sittin' here with you three with
a friggin' Korean janitor outfit on.
I loved that dog.
I think about her every day.
Show me where you found the car,
and I'll show you the place.
We stole the car on Rodney Street,
belongs to the Jargoniew brothers.
Maybe we could do somethin'
about this situation.
What, you're gonna fuck 'em up
with a pair of pliers?
- Holy shit. Who are you guys?
- Remember that?
- Oh, my baby, I've missed you.
- Mr. Hirsch...
- Remember me? I do this.
- Uh-huh.
- What time is it?
- I don't know. What time is it?
- Hey, Val...
- Yeah.
- No, it's better.
- Yeah, why?
- Yeah, that's right. That's the reason.
- See you soon.
- Yeah, OK, you see the place...
- Mm-hmm.
We're just three people, walking
down the street, nothing suspicious.
- No, I wanna watch.
- Oh, no, honey, nobody watches us work.
Besides, there may be
five or six guys in there, you know.
Just the two of us. It may not turn out
the way we would hope.
- All right, so what? I-I can help.
- Go home, get some rest.
- No.
- We can't know...
- what's on the other side of that door.
- No... No.
- I don't think she's gonna listen.
- No, she seems, uh, firm about it.
- She's not gonna leave.
- Listen, honey...
Why don't you wait here
about 10 minutes, and then come on in.
It's true,
but I know ya, at the same time.
- Makes me sick, what they did to you.
- They're fuckin' animals.
- There used to be consequences.
- Exactly.
They think they can do things like this
to people, and get away with it.
- Fuck did you get in here?
- We're friends of Sylvia.
Yeah, you remember Sylvia.
The naked girl you put in your trunk.
Yes, I'd like to report
a large cache of weapons and drugs.
- It's Rodney Street.
- I know that. What-what number?
- Go fuck yerself.
- Ooh...
- 172.
- 172.
172 Rodney.
Thank you so much. Have a great night.
- OK, Sylvie...
- Yeah?
You know, you got about eight minutes
before the cops call.
- Good luck, fellas.
- Enjoy.
- Ahhhhh!
- I got blood all over my jacket.
- It takes the stains right out.
- What the fuck is that, biological?
I'm telling you,
it'll take that stain right out.
No, you can't get these stains out,
no matter how many times you wash 'em.
A blood stain stays in.
You can't get this fucking stuff out.
- A new suit?
- Yeah.
- It's always somethin', ain't it?
- Yeah.
- He got his last wish.
- Yeah.
- We got to work together again.
- Yeah, we got to work together again.
- Uh, you know where Nina Hirsch works?
- I think she's over there.
- Hey, Nina, remember us?
- Sure. How's your pecker?
It's all right.
Uh, listen, uh, your dad's dead.
- What?
- We're sorry.
Well, we-we-we took him for a night out
is all, and well, you know, he died.
He's outside in a stolen sports car,
in the front seat.
- See?
- He's still warm.
It didn't happen, uh,
more than 30 minutes ago.
- What were you guys doing?
- Having fun just like old times.
- He went out with a bang.
- Is there a family plot or something?
I think Hirsch will be glad
to be next to your mother.
"Darlin', just come visit me from time
to time. Let me know how it's going."
You taught me that the best thing
a person could be is of some use.
Would you do it.
I'm not good at stuff like this.
I remember one time, uh,
we robbed this liquor store.
who knows our name,
who remembers our childhood.
Once, when the breath leaves our body,
and once...
when the last person we know
says our name.
Hirsch's life will be forgotten,
like all the other poor...
- Amen.
- Amen.
- What?
- Nothing. That was really good.
- Best I ever heard.
- You think so?
- Really good, bro.
- Fuck you.
- Thank you, Valentine.
- Uh yeah well, it was nothing. I just..
- Thank you.
- It's OK.
- Nothing you could say about that.
- Nah.
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
And after breakfast,
we'll get you a new suit.
Then you can shoot me in the head,
so it doesn't fuck up my suit.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Who's gonna wanna take that
piece of shit?
- Well, good morning, fellas.
- Hi, Alex.
Now, are you two up early,
or are you going to bed late?
And what's going on here
with all this dirt?
- Yeah, well, you know...
- Gardenin'.
We've been doing a spot of
late night gardenin'.
- Huh.
- Oh, yeah, you should try it some time.
Boy, you look at you, young lady. You're
pulling a long shift tonight, huh?
I sort of like being awake when
everyone else is sleeping, you know?
- Being alive.
- Yes.
- I know the feeling, believe me.
- OK, so, what'll it be, Doc?
- Uh, two eggs over easy.
- Of course.
And I will have a steak, waffles, uh,
Greek omelet, Greek salad, banana malt.
- And another steak, and a coffee.
- And a coffee.
- Oh, and a muffin.
- And a muffin.
- If you don't mind.
- I don't mind.
- You are a very hungry man, Val.
- Uh, I'm leaving on a long trip.
Oh, just when
we're gettin' to know each other.
- Hmm, I'll put that order right in.
- Yeah.
but Alex, the waitress,
is your granddaughter, no?
- You gotta tell her.
- I'm going to.
- I can't.
- How come?
- The truth will set you free, brother.
- OK, but not today.
- Then when?
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow. You promise?
- Tomorrow, tell her everything.
- Don't go sentimental on me now.
- Excuse me.
- Here you go.
- Yeah.
- So, Val...
- So, Alex...
So Doc comes in here
every morning, you know?
And he always orders
the same exact thing.
I can't help but wonder about
most of my customers, but...
- I wonder about him the most.
- Well, I don't know, you know...
What do you, uh,
what do you imagine he's like?
Please, mercy, is all I'm saying, mercy.
I know it was your only son. I know what
Please bring back my only son!
See how far "please" gets you!
He'll be dead soon enough. Just give him
a few more years. What's the difference?
- What is the fucking difference?
- How's Alex, fuckface?
I betcha my left nut,
you can see the bitch right this second.
It would be a fucking shame
to see such a young honey get into
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, really?
I imagine he's a man who knows
what it's like to be alone.
And, that maybe he comes here every day
just to be around other people.
Even if it's only for a half an hour,
just, just to be around people.
That's right. That's exactly right.
Sometimes...
what we imagine
and the world aren't different things.
Finish this fucknut,
or accidents can, and will happen.
I think your food is ready. You know,
I wish we could've talked more, Val.
Me too.
It was nice sittin' here with you.
- Uh, you do.
- I do. Right, OK, so, um...
- forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
- How long since your last confession?
Now, confess each and every serious sin
that separates you from Christ.
Father, can we just deal
with what happened today.
I shot a guy in the kneecap,
and one in the arm.
stole a bunch of prescription drugs,
and a sweet-ass car.
Punched a Korean store clerk
in the face, and took his clothes.
- today?
- Uh...
But I did some good things too, Father.
I-I, uh...
helped this young woman
take her life back, and, uh...
I don't think that you're gonna be able
to Hail Mary your way outta this one.
- Why don't you take this?
- What's that?
- It's for your troubles.
- No, oh, no.
- No, no... buy yourself a steak dinner.
- I'm a vegetarian.
Why?
Am I gonna play a game of shuffleboard?
Come on,
let's-let's-let's be serious here.
- We came here for a suit, find a suit
- Hey, this one.
- 42 Long.
- I wear 40 Regular.
No crying for you.
We didn't say anything about me.
- It's beautiful. Lemme have it a sec.
- It'll look great on you.
- You think so?
- Definitely.
- Why don't you try one on?
- Nah, I'm OK.
Uh, yeah,
I wasn't gonna say anything, but, uh...
- Yeah, but what?
- What?
You dress like you're on your way to the
Gin Rummy Championship for the World.
- Here.
- Uh-uh, I prefer black.
I can't see myself wearing that,
like every day, you know.
- You fucking shoppin'?
- What?
Isn't there something else
you're supposed to be doing?
If we do this,
there's one thing you should know.
- Go.
- Yeah.
The old days,
I'da had him with the throat punch.
You gotta admit,
it felt good though, didn't it?
- Do I?
- Yeah.
That's what I'm saying, you know, a
change of wardrobe can be just the thing
- Definitely.
- Yeah.
- May I?
- Be my guest.
- Boom!
- Whoa! I could hear the... Fuck!
- You see that?
- I did.
It wa..., it was good though, huh?
I got my hips in.
- So...
- So...
- Well, I had it coming, didn't it?
- it didn't.

I want you to know
some of the things I thought...
I know they look like the sunrise,
but I was painting you.
The closet.
On the top shelf, there's a shoebox.
Put the phone down, open it.
I'll wait, no rush.
Welcome home,
the rent is paid for a year.
What do you mean?
When am I gonna see you again?
