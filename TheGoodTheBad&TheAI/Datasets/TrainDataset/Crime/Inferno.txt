"Inferno " ^
It took the earth's population
a hundred thousand years
to reach a billion people.
And then just, a hundred more
to reach 2 billion.
And only 50 years
to double again...
double again
to four billion in 1970.
We're nearly at eight billion now.
... 8 billion now.
We are destroying the very means
where there is life is insane.
Every single global ill that plagues the Earth
can be traced back...
traced back to human overpopulation...
human overpopulation.
What didn't we demand any action?
Declared cut,
consumed or destroyed.
Half the animal species
on earth have vanished
vanished for the last 40 years...
... we keep attacking
our own environment!
it doesn't take a catastrophe
to get our attention.
Nothing changes behaviour like pain.
Maybe pain can save us.
There is a switch,
if you throw it,
half the people on earth will die.
But if you don't, the human race
will be extinct in a hundred years.
What would you do?
Mankind is the cancer
in its own body.
Do you love humanity
enough to save it?
In case, they find me,
I left you a path.
The hardest one yet.
Inferno will be at the end
You are my contingency plan.
You are humanity's final hope.
Make sure Inferno is unleashed.
Seek and find.
Badia Fiorentina.
A long road.
but here we are.
Better me,
than the Americans.
You're going to want to
tell me where it is.
Yes, Mr. Bouchard.
I know I will.
Tell them,
"Humanity is the disease,
Inferno is the cure."
Okay.
Traitor!
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.
Pay for your sins.
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.
Mr. Langdon, I'm Dr. Brooks.
I'm going to do a few checks,
nothing to worry about.
Let's get rid of this, shall we?
Do you know what day
of the week it is?
Saturday.
It's Monday,
Monday, 28th of June.
Do you know where we are?
Boston.
Massachusetts General.
And what's the last thing
you can remember?
I uh...
I was on campus.
Everything is blur.
It's out of focus.
Was I in some kind
of an accident?
We'll get to that.
Is there someone
we should call for you?
No.
Your Wife?
Family?
No. No.
I'm not married.
Professor Langdon, you're suffering
from a head trauma.
You appeared to have
a mild retrograde amnesia
We've done a CT scan,
there's no evidence of intracranial bleeding.
Which is very reassuring.
Non-terminal.
Just try to relax.
Neurologically, you seem to be fine.
Your memory will return
over the next several days.
So we'll...
we'll wait and watch.
Could you turn off the lights please.
Of course.
If the head trauma was bad enough
to cause a cerebral contusion, then...
Can you please-
Can you please turn off the lights?
What am I...
doing... in Florence?
That's Il Duomo.
That's the Palazzo Vecchio, isn't it?
Yes.
How...
How did I get here?
You came to our emergency room
Was I...
Was I with a woman?
No, a cab driver brought you in.
No wallet. No phone.
No ID.
How do you know my name?
We've met.
I saw you at the Church in
Imperial College London, we spoke afterward,
you were very nice to me.
We've met.
Sorry, that's not quite fair.
I was nine at that time.
Wait.
Nine-nine years old?
I was crazy about puzzles.
And I like your books.
Maybe not "Lost language of Ideograms",
but the others.
Okay.
I read them all.
A weird kid.
I was actually.
Did I say that out loud?
You did.
Very sorry.
Professor Langdon, your headaches
are going to be intense initially.
And you can also expect
nausea, confusion and dizziness.
That was the front desk.
The police are here to see you.
Me, why?
Before you talk to them, Professor Langdon,
you should know the facts of your case.
Your head wound was not
caused by an accident.
It was the result of a gunshot.
A bullet grazed the top of your skull
and you most likely took a bad fall
which is what caused the concussion.
If the bullet had been
an inch to the side,
it could have killed you.
This way.
This way, come on.
Taxi.
Get in.
This is going to hurt.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Seek and find.
This is my apartment.
You're still in Florence.
I'm going to call the police.
Wait.
That policewoman just tried to kill us.
Okay.
We will call the U.S. Consulate
instead if you like.
Just... wait.
Just give me... give me a minute.
Why was someone shooting at you?
I don't know.
Also, when you came into ER,
you were mumbling
something over and over.
Very sorr...
Very sorry.
Very sorry.
Do you have any idea
why you would be saying this?
- No.
- Why was someone shooting at you?
You can keep asking me
these questions, lady.
But I'm not going to
know these answers!
My name is Sienna.
I'm sorry.
Hello.
Hi.
You asked a lot of questions.
Yeah, I'm feeling a tad
vulnerable right now.
I'm with someone
other people want to shoot at!
I'm sorry.
Questions are important.
And I hope you recover.
May I ask you for a...
cup of a...
What?
It's brown and it's... hot.
People drink it in the morning
for energy. Uh...
Tea.
Tea.
No. The other one.
- Coffee.
- Coffee.
Could I have a cup of coffee?
Sure.
Thank you.
You are very organized.
I like things tidy.
Thank you for helping me
in the hospital.
That was very courageous.
It's just reflexes.
I feel I'm having visions.
It's the head trauma.
You won't be able to trust
your own thoughts for a while.
I saw a plague mask.
It's the kind the medieval doctors
wore in... during the Black death.
You said something about that.
You were talking in the cab
but mostly incoherent
But I did hear the word mask.
Anything else?
The bodies,
the blood and fire and...
... hell.
And there's a woman.
The woman, she seemed...
Seek and find.
Uh.
Well, seemed so dangerous.
No, you got to have somebody
we should call.
I do?
Why?
My wat...
Was I wearing
my watch when I was
brought to the hospital?
No.
You weren't wearing a watch.
It's important to me.
It was a gift from my parents.
Look, you should
go ahead and clean up.
Your clothes are covered in blood but
I think I got something that might fit you.
Once you get dressed,
we'll call the police, okay?
No. No.
The Consulate.
Right.
The Consulate.
Coffee.
Ignazio Busoni : I PRAY YOU ARE ALL RIGHT
Ignazio?
I'm sorry I couldn't meet as planned.
Now they're after me too.
What we stole
... is safely hidden, as am I.
"What we stole"?
Paradise Twenty-five.
Ignazio.
I've left your things
in the bathroom.
Try these.
Whose are they?
A friend.
Does he live here?
Sometimes.
Oh.
Sometimes, huh.
You're being rude.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm not like this.
You kind of are.
I found this in my old jacket.
It's a biotube.
They're used for transporting
dangerous substances.
What are you doing with it?
I have no idea.
It's a high end unit.
Government issue.
It's called thumbprint recognition.
Security in case it's lost or stolen.
Tubes like this can only be opened
by a specified individual.
Well, it sure hell isn't me.
- Then why do you have it?
- I don't know.
I'm getting the number
for the Consulate.
No, please.
Wait.
I have waited.
This isn't right.
Why do you have it?
Where did you get it?
Look, there is a simple way
to find out if this thing
belongs to me.
Then my thumb will open it
or it won't.
Open it, are you insane?
If it's a viral agent,
will it be released if I opened it?
No.
No, there'll be an inner seal
maybe even two.
Before I put myself in anyone's hands
I want to know what this thing is.
Uh, and what I'm involved with.
That make sense, doesn't it?
Yes.
So, we agree.
We're opening it.
Well, that explains
that it is mine.
This is a cylinder seal
made of ivory.
No.
It's bone.
Human.
Three-headed, man eating Satan.
A common image from the Middle Ages
associated with the Black Plague.
The 3 gnashing mouths
are symbolic of
how effectively the plague ate
through the population.
Yet you can't remember
the word for coffee.
It explains my visions,
sort of.
- Do you hear that?
- Mm-mm.
This could be a Faraday pointer.
So why-why this, huh?
It's Botticelli.
It's his map of hell.
He painted it as an
illustration of Dante's Inferno.
I studied Dante
when I was younger.
Probably in kindergarden.
I was a bit obsessed.
Dante defined our modern conception of hell.
Our vision of it hasn't changed
since he defined it 700 years ago.
Botticelli drew it but...
Dante created hell as we know it.
This is what I have been seeing.
Torment.
Sinners.
Branding the mongers.
Liars, covered with rashes.
Soothsayers with their heads
turned backwards.
- Serpents.
- The punishment for thievery.
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.
So you have no idea
why you have this?
I think maybe
we call the consulate now.
Right.
Professor Langdon?
Hello, yes.
Speaking.
Thank heavens you're alive.
We've been looking for you.
You have?
Are you still in possession?
Mr. Langdon, do you have the tube?
- Yes.
- Where are you located?
Professor, we can't help you
if we can't find you.
If that's the consulate,
how do they know?
Because they know.
What do we do?
Tell them you're over there.
- Hello.
- Professor, we were cut off.
Yes, sorry.
Where are you located?
I'm at a hotel,
Pensione la Fiorentina.
Stay in your room.
We're sending someone now.
I'll wait here,
room 39.
Okay.
We wait and see who they send.
Langdon accessed his email account from
an unmasked IP address here in Florence
- When?
- 7 minutes ago.
Via Dolorosa, number 12,
apartment 3C.
Via Dolorosa, how long?
Go! I want that pointer back
and I want Langdon.
Aapartment 3C, let's get him.
Go, go, go, go, now!
Look at this.
This is odd.
This area here is
Dante's 8th level of hell.
It's called the Malebolge,
means evil ditches.
There's ten.
This letter "R" here,
is not in the original painting.
It's been added.
There's another one.
- Where?
- An "E".
On seducers whipped by demons.
- There's a "C" on the cheek of a...
- A grafter.
- ... a grafter.
- A conman trapped in a pool of boiling tar.
- A "V", "R".
- Ah, there.
- T.
- There, there, A.
What is that.
That's text.
Is that a name?
THE TRUTH CAN BE GLIMPSED ONLY
THROUGH THE EYES OF DEATH.
ZOBRIST.
Bertrand Zobrist.
- American billionaire, that must be nice.
- Hm.
Bioengineer
Notorious for radical views.
Here he is.
It took the earth's population
a hundred thousand years
to reach a billion people.
And then just a hundred more
to reach two billion.
And only fifty years to double again
to four billion people in 1970.
We're nearly at eight billion now.
Using the example of a beaker.
With a single bacterium.
One that divides
and doubles every minute.
If you placed the first bacterium
into the beaker at 11 o'clock.
and it's completely full by 12.
At what time is the beaker
still only half full?
That's what time it is for us.
In 40 years,
No fail.
We're a minute to midnight.
Every single global ill that plagues the Earth
can be traced back to human overpopulation.
But serious birth control measures
they don't stand a chance.
Outrageous!
Violation of my rights!
Invasion of my privacy!
Don't tell me what to do!
But still we keep attacking
our own environment!
They have been 5 major extinctions
in the earth's history.
Unless we take bold immediate action
the sixth extinction
will be our own.
We're a minute to midnight.
Looks like he's got
a lot of followers.
Yeah, from all over the world.
He is compelling.
The 2 year disappearance during which
some authorities feared Zobrist
may have designed
an opportunistic viral pathogen.
He created a plague.
But, why Dante?
Why this map of hell?
Is this supposed to be a puzzle
or a challenge?
Or a suicide note.
He killed himself 3 days ago.
The levels.
The levels are out of order,
that's what's been bothering me.
This circles of hell
had been rearranged.
It's the same woman
from the hospital.
We can't stay here.
We certainly can't trust the Consulate.
The letter are encrypted as committers,
that's not right.
If the plague exist, do you know
how many governments would want it?
Clerical profiteers, not there.
- What they would do to get it.
- Someone who discord dead, no.
A biological weapon.
The letters.
He has assigned a letter to each sin
and then changed their order.
He's made an anagram.
Yes.
Anagram.
Let's go.
I know another way out.
If you have phoned,
best leave it here.
They might track it.
The phone?
I'm not even wearing my own clothes.
Good.
Let's go.
Robert Langdon!
World Health Organization!
V, R, O.
I got to rearrange these letters,
CATROVACER.
COVER
CAT
God.
I used to be good at this.
Cerca trova.
It's a ten.
It means "seek" and "find".
Cerca trova.
Yes!
I know why
I am in Florence.
World Health Organization has landed, standby.
He's arrived.
Agent Bouchard, we and the
first officers are already here.
Bring me up to speed.
Bouchard is up there now.
- Where are we going?
- The Palazzo Vecchio, near the Boboli Gardens.
There's no sign of him.
Bouchard says Langdon is gone
and so is the pointer.
Well, I need better.
I need better from you,
from you, from all of us.
Better!
Work faster. Work smarter.
Don't trust anyone.
Let's do that.
- Let's go.
- Yes.
- Identification.
- Vayentha.
- Go ahead.
- I need to speak to the provost.
Hold on.
The Mendacium.
So, the WHO beat you to
Mr. Langdon, Vayentha.
The provost isn't going to like that.
I know.
He's going to want to live with it.
Tell him this isn't Berlin.
He tries anything
and I will find him.
Try to reacquire and
make contact in 60 minutes.
Did you hear me?
I am not disposable.
Vayentha, get the Faraday pointer
before the government does.
Shit.
- Mr. Sims.
- Mm.
There's been a deviation.
Sorry to hear that.
- What operation?
- Florence.
Our new players seemed
to have gone off script.
How unprofessional.
And now the WHO has
overtaken our position.
Tell Vayentha,
if she values her position
she will remove Langdon.
Body not found.
Or better yet,
a mugging gone awry.
A blade, I think.
Cash gone, wallet remains.
Let's have a quick identification
and move on. Move on, move on.
Professor Langdon is
out of frame.
- And in possession of the tube?
- Yes.
He has the Faraday pointer.
He was such a good frame.
- What is Vayentha's condition?
- Intact but anxious.
She should be.
What in god's name
has this client gotten us into?
No, no, no.
This is uh... rhetorical.
When are we due to release
the client's video?
It just arrived.
His instructions were to
upload it in 24 hours.
I want to look at it now.
But, the client, Mr. Zobrist.
The client, client, is dead.
I want to see the video.
That's a violation of our protocols.
We're not the government.
We get things done.
Mr. Arbogast.
Chief among the attributes that makes us
so very good at our job
is that as far as the world
is concerned, we don't exist.
If this video implicates or
even mentions us in anyway,
I want to stop it's release.
For the benefit of all our clients.
You asked me to avoid abnormalities
in procedure, that's all.
What about Mr. Zobrist
has ever remotely resembled normal.
- Well, I...
- Also rhetorical.
Bring me the video.
In the Vecchio's Hall of the
Five Hundred is a famous mural,
Giorgio Vasari's Battle of Marciano.
Near the top of the mural
is a coded message
which is one the art world's
most famous puzzles.
And what's the message?
Cerca trova.
Seek and find.
At the hospital,
I kept saying I was sorry.
Very sorry, over and over.
Well, maybe that's not
what I meant.
The name of the artist, Vasari.
I could have been saying Vasari.
That's good.
You seem clearer.
- I am.
- What's your middle name?
Well, I am.
Mm-hm.
Zobrist is dead
but if his plague is real...
And this map is a trail
he has left so someone can find it.
Who?
Well, someone who believes
the same as he does.
And that's why you have it.
Well, I don't remember
ever meeting Zobrist.
There's a lot you don't remember.
Maybe they-
Maybe they came to you.
Wanted your help with the part.
- Because I lectured on Dante?
- Exactly.
They showed you this Faraday pointer,
tried to convince you of their cause.
- Mass murder?
- You said you found him compelling.
His argument.
Not his plan!
Zobrist is a psychopath.
Well, maybe they tricked you.
Sent...
someone you knew.
It's a minute to midnight.
- Is that for us?
- And what would you suggest?
Damn it!
Here, come on.
Follow me.
We could get there
through the park.
Okay, the-
the Palazzo Vecchio is this way.
We just flagged the car charged to
her credit card within the past hour.
There's a small gray door
to the mural.
It will take us into
the Vasari corridor.
Right across the Ponte Vecchio,
into the Palazzo.
That's the door, see.
Now!
Is the back secured.
On all sides.
The Professor has become a liability, Vayentha.
The provost has issued a kill order.
Eliminate Langdon.
Fail, and you will be held accountable.
Am I making myself clear?
Copy that, sir.
There.
That's the Vasari fresco,
The Battle of Marciano.
There. There.
Look. Look, look, look.
Okay, see the 2 farmhouses,
dead center up high,
come down to it's 4 o'clock.
It's a small green flag.
- Cerca trova.
- Yeah.
Seek and find.
Seek and find.
We sought it and
we found it.
So, now what?
The words Zobrist
added to the painting.
The truth can be glimpsed
only through the eyes of death.
Eyes of death.
Whose's eyes?
Was I given an injection?
When?
- At the hospital, with a hypertenol?
- No.
No, you were intubated.
Anything you got came through the IV.
Not at the hospital.
I was fully dress like this
at the back of some car...
at some point
in the last 2 days.
And something was injected
into my bloodstream.
and now I'm showing
signs of an illness
What if?
What if what?
Sienna, what if I'm the carrier?
No.
If you've got it
then I've got it too.
And everyone we've come into
contact with has it and will likely die.
But if you don't.
If-If they gave you an anotic
or a hallucinogen or anything else.
Then we still have a chance
to save half the world.
It's worth a try, isn't it?
Professor.
Ah, it is you.
Why are you back so soon?
I have no idea
who this woman is.
I almost didn't recognize you in that suit.
You've been shopping?
Professor, you bumped your head.
In the shower, yes.
It's quite a toll.
- Ayes.
- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
This is Sienna, my niece.
You're in Italy, Professor,
you don't have to say 'niece'.
- No. No.
- No, he's not.
Hello.
Marta Alvarez. Pleasure to meet you.
Is Ignazio with you again?
- Ignazio?
- Yeah.
Ignazio couldn't make it
this morning.
I'm sorry to bother you, Marta.
But...
I can imagine you know why
I'm back. Again.
Really?
Of all the treasures in the Palazzo.
He and il Duomino spent almost an hour
with it up there last night.
It's-It's so morbid.
No. No.
It's cool.
Alright, come on.
I'm headed up that way.
He's an extremely resourceful man.
I was told you were
as well, Mr. Bouchard.
So.
Tell me.
What do you think he's doing?
What you think you doing?
I brought you the pointer
and now it's gone.
- You have lead.
- We losed him in the street.
Reacquired him at the doctor's apartment.
I can handle with some ground.
- We don't need your help.
- What if he's injured.
A head wound.
What?
You think he's confused.
- He doesn't know what he's doing?
- It's possible.
How far did he get
the night before he disappeared?
To the Hall of Five Hundred.
So let's stop chasing him,
anticipate him instead.
Whoa, inspector.
Not so fast, please.
I'm about to burst.
Such a romantic date he takes you on.
To see a death mask.
Yeah, they were common practice
in the 1500s.
It's essentially just a plaster cast of someone's face,
made a few moments after that person dies.
"Through the eyes of death."
The person who was used for this mask,
the poet,
Dante.
It is a romantic story I supposed.
Dante loved Florence,
he was prominent and powerful. But...
The political winds changed
and he was exiled.
They threatened to burn him
at the stake if he ever returned.
Actually, some people say Dante's exile
is the reason his death mask looks so sad.
No. No.
It was because of Beatrice.
Dante revered her from afar but
he was obsessed with her his entire life.
Your niece is a romantic, Professor.
They say Dante wrote in fact about
his journey out of hell to reach her.
But he never made it.
She married someone else.
That happens.
Does it?
Who left who?
Things fall apart if
you don't look after them.
Oh. We ask that you stay
behind the stanchions. Please.
Thank you.
Good timing, Professor.
We've only just opened.
Marta...
Yes?
There.
That's us.
That's Ignazio.
I've known him for years.
He's the Dante scholar.
The mask's owner insists on the
stanchions to keep people back.
He doesn't even permit staff to open
the case without him present.
So the mask is not owned
by the museum?
No.
A private collector bought it from us,
and allows us to
display it in perpetuity.
It's a common practice,
to raise funds.
Who is the collector?
Bertram Zobrist, the billionaire.
His ideas were quite eccentric,
but still it's such a shame what happened.
That's when I got the call.
Oh.
Professor, I...
I don't know what to think!
I am appalled!
- Professor.
- Professor Langdon.
Look.
There's an explanation for all this.
I'll be right back.
Marta, don't let them go.
Professor.
Professor, I very much respect you
but I do not understand.
- Please sit down. I'm going to explain this.
- Why you have done this?
- This is not okay.
- Marta, I do not know where the mask is.
But I'm going to do everything I can
to find it and return it to you.
Professor, what are you doing?
Professor, please. No.
Professor, come back.
Don't do that.
Professor, please don't.
- Hey. Hey.
- Professor.
- Just don't follow us.
- Please, don't do this.
Professor!
Let's just calmly
find a way out of here.
Why didn't you tell me about Ignazio?
Would you help me
if you knew I was a thief?
You lied to me when
you asked for my help.
Well technically, I withheld.
If I really took that mask...
You did take the mask,
I just saw you.
This is not your problem.
You don't have to stay.
Of course, I do.
Human lives are at stake.
I just want to know that
I'm on the right side.
You are.
I swear.
Good.
Now let's find what
we're looking for.
Call this Ignazio, and ask him
where he hid the mask.
Ignazio's disappeared.
He had gone into hiding.
He said.
They were chasing him too
but he left a clue.
He gave me,
"Paradise Twenty-five".
That's a reference to Dante's Divine Comedy.
"Canto XXV." But...
- I need a copy of the book.
- A copy of the book.
That's quaint.
I use Google.
They're closing down the museum,
only the main exit is going to be open.
Then I think
we'll go through Armenia.
All exit doors are now sealed.
This is the only way
in or out.
What about hidden exits?
Tunnels, concealed doorways?
It's a 700 year old Palazzo, Signore,
there are a number of them.
Show me.
ARMENIA
Professor.
How worldly.
Secrets of the Palazzo Invisibile.
It's a great tour,
you should take it sometime.
We should be safe here
for a minute.
Go.
By then with other voice,
with other fleece...
I shall return as poet and put on,
at my baptismal font, the laurel crown...
Baptismal font.
Il Duomo.
The Cathedral where Dante was baptized.
That's where Ignazio works.
That's where he hid the mask.
They're going to think
we're heading down to the exit.
Then we go up.
Alright.
We're right above the
Hall of Five Hundred.
There's a stairway leading down
to the street on the other side.
One step at a time.
Okay?
Are you afraid of heights?
A little.
I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.
So, don't look down.
Or do.
I can't never remember which.
It's not that hard.
Sienna!
Are you alright?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Alright, just...
crawl along that beam there.
And I'll meet you on the
far side, by the ladder.
Sir.
Give me a six men stationed here.
Safeties off.
You're being stupid now, Professor Langdon!
Get out, go.
They needed you but now
they changed their minds.
Get these people out.
Get them out and clear the room.
Give me that.
These doors, here.
Eastern side.
That's where they're headed.
Go, move.
Quick!
Bouchard.
Agent Bouchard, come in.
What is your location?
Agent Bouchard, come in.
That same word is on the envelope
the video arrived in,
along with the date.
The date is tomorrow.
Well, thank you,
that was not lost on me.
The darkest places in hell
are reserved for those
who refuse to act in
times of moral crisis.
Dante's hell isn't fiction anymore,
it's a prophecy.
We have created
our own hell on earth.
Oh my.
The warnings have been obvious,
the solutions ignored.
So, I took action.
If you are watching this,
it means the Inferno virus was released
last night at midnight.
It's now being carried to
every corner on Earth.
Oh my.
Within 6 days of it's released,
the virus will replicate itself.
And every man, woman and child
on Earth expect the current...
the current population
to recall by half.
The survivors will witness
horrors...
unknown to this planet.
But I want them to know why.
That this was our doing
and this is our salvation.
Now is the time.
Today is...
There's more.
I think I've got the gist.
It appears our organization has spent
the last several years
in the employ of a madman
who now intends to commit a mass murder
using a deadly plague of his own creation
in some point in the next 24...
Sorry.
Less than 12 hours.
So, let's do our level best
not to fuck things up
any worse than we already have,
shall we?
Without the Faraday pointer,
no one can find the virus.
Where is Professor Langdon now?
He was with Dr. Brooks in the Boboli Gardens
but we seemed to have lost visual.
And I'm afraid we have
no contact from Vayentha.
I see.
I'm going to Florence myself.
Test her for signs of contagion
and quarantine this girl.
If we don't find Langdon very soon,
we are going to be looking at
a great many more dead bodies.
Are you alright?
It's weakness.
Just weakness, god damn it.
We'll just take a moment.
Did you see her down there?
Yes.
Everything I've done, every bit of
ward and studies since I was eleven
is to stop death, not cause it.
It was self defense.
Someone was trying to kill us.
I don't know if
I can finish this.
I understand if you can't.
Look, Zobrist is the murderer,
not you.
You saved me.
You don't have to
take another step.
Yeah, you're right.
I did what was necessary and
I'll do it again if I need to.
I pray that you don't.
Looks like it's close for repairs.
Here.
There.
The baptismal font.
Dante again.
Always Dante, why Dante?
- Acrylic gesso.
- You mean paint.
Water soluble paint.
Smells like a wet dog.
Look at that.
It's a writing.
"Seek the treacherous Doge of Venice,
- who severed the heads from horses."
- Venice.
Where Dante was infected
with the disease that killed him.
"Kneel within the gilded museum
of holy wisdom,
and listen for the sounds
of trickling water."
"Follow deep into the sunken palace,
- where the chthonic monster waits."
- The plague itself.
Underwater.
"Submerged in the
blood-red waters of...
... of the lagoon that reflects no stars."
- Professor.
Could you please tell me
what the hell you are doing?
Why haven't you called in?
Who are you?
Christoph Bouchard,
from the World Health Organization.
- We've met.
- We've met?
You really don't remember?
It was just 2 days ago.
He's suffering the effects
of a head wound.
He can't remember the events
for the last 48 hours.
I'm the one who flew to Cambridge
and asked for your help.
I gave you the pointer
to decode.
Mr. Langdon.
Yes.
Okay.
I remember.
Who are you?
I was the ER doctor at the hospital
when the Professor came in.
What is the last thing you remember?
I was on the street.
I think it was here.
I was with a woman.
- And I was given an injection.
- Elizabeth Sinskey.
Elizabeth?
From the World Health Organization.
Do you know her?
I do.
But I haven't seen Elizabeth in years.
She's the reason
I followed you alone.
What do you mean?
I believe Dr. Sinskey is working
with a foreign government
to find and sell the virus.
No. No. No.
That's not possible.
People change, Professor.
I've been chasing
Bertrand Zobrist for 2 years.
And someone has been
working against me.
Let's get to the point.
You know where the virus is?
I assume you have
some sort of credentials.
Call WHO if you like.
Check me out,
but do it quickly.
Venice.
We think it's Venice.
Good.
It's 2 hours by train.
Come on.
If I could find you,
so can the others.
I'm buying you both
plane tickets to Geneva.
No, not Geneva.
He said Venice.
I have them.
Excuse us.
Watch yourself, please.
- This is the plane to Geneva?
- Yes, but we just closed the door.
Keep the plane at the gate.
We need to check every passenger.
That would be a waste of time.
And we have very little of that.
of searching, I found Zobrist.
He killed himself.
But we took a package from his pocket.
And what was that?
The Faraday pointer
with the map of hell.
A puzzle, specifically designed
for his followers to solve.
We brought it to you.
And you want to
process it accordingly,
but you were kidnapped.
Professor Langdon.
- You were with Dr. Sinskey at the time.
- Elizabeth, yes.
Did she tell you about any
third party interest in the virus?
- I don't remember.
- Did she have financial problems?
Uh, I don't know.
Did she carry more
than one cellphone?
I don't know.
- Think.
- He doesn't remember.
Then tell me who can remember, Professor!
Enough with the "I don't know, I don't remember."!
The "gilded museum,"
is that Saint Mark's.
All of Venice is a museum.
St. Mark's has the Horses of Constantinople,
they're bronze statues.
Can I see that?
I wouldn't touch it.
I wasn't planning to.
Professor.
Professor Langdon.
Professor Langdon.
Professor Langdon.
Yes.
Hello, Robert.
Elizabeth.
It's been a long time.
Too long.
What brings you here?
The WHO needs your help.
My help?
I hope you still
remember your Dante.
What just happened?
Are you alright?
Could you get some water?
He could be dehydrated.
Some food, maybe some fruit
or something from the machine.
Quickly.
Thank you.
- Is he lying?
- Through his teeth.
He was not the one who came
to Cambridge to see me.
Bouchard, I need help, quickly.
I think he's collapsed.
I can't open the door.
Langdon?
Are you okay?
Langdon, are you okay?
You're telling me that
for 2 years,
you and your organization
have been working against me.
That is correct.
To shield Bertrand Zobrist
and his research.
- To hide him, to protect him.
- Regrettably, yes.
And that all of my attempts
to prevent him from initiating
a worldwide pandemic
have failed because of you.
An incisive sum-up, yes.
And now you have the temerity to ask
that I simply decide to trust you?
I'm terribly sorry,
I didn't see any other way.
Who exactly does
your group work for?
Our clients, of course.
We are a private security firm.
A very successful one.
May I ask,
the gentleman who is with you,
an agent Bouchard,
where is he now?
We don't know.
We lost track of him.
Then the situation is
worse than you think.
There is only one reason
he wouldn't move on your puppet,
he wants Mr. Langdon to himself.
Why?
To find the virus and sell it
to the highest bidder I assume.
Leverage, blackmail,
you know, the usual shit.
I don't think we have anything
further to discuss, Mr. Sims.
And I have less than 8 hours
to find this pathogen, excuse me.
From what I understand,
you knew the Professor sometime ago.
First hand knowledge.
You care about him.
You would even ally with an unscrupulous character
such as myself to protect him, wouldn't you?
My organization has the resources
to find the Professor.
If you wanted to start a plague,
this is where you do it.
Yep.
from every corner of the globe.
During the Black Death,
the Venetians made all the ships
anchored in the harbor
for 40 days,
before they would allow
the crews into the city.
Making sure that they were not
carrying the Plague.
The word "Quarantine"
comes from the Italian.
"quaranta",
"forty".
It's nice to have you back, Professor.
There, the horses.
These were recreations, the originals
are in a museum for preservation.
We should be quick.
Bouchard knows we are coming here.
Ask that guide, if the heads have
ever been severed from these horses?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Please excuse me.
Please.
According to the tale,
during the Crusades,
the horses were looted
from Constantinople.
But they were too large to be
loaded on board the ships,
so their heads were removed
and reattached.
By whom?
The doge who lived forever,
Enrico Dandolo.
- Enrico Dandolo.
- The doge who lived forever.
Of course, Enrico Dandolo.
Dandolo tricked the Venetians into the Crusades.
He was supposed to sail his ships to Egypt,
but he sacked Constantinople instead.
I'm sorry.
Of course.
"The gilded museum of holy wisdom."
Are we in the wrong basilica?
We're in the wrong country.
Dandolo passed,
but he was not buried here.
So where was he buried?
Hagia Sophia.
- Istanbul.
- Istanbul.
There's always a way out.
Here.
Here.
See if you could get that open.
I got your foot.
Can you get it?
Is there someone there?
Please help.
Yes.
Give me a hand.
- One hundred.
- Yes! Yes.
- A hundred euro.
- Here. I got it. I got it.
Quick. Quick. Quick.
What are you doing?
You called him a murderer,
a psychopath.
What?
But history will call us saviors.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
I'm not afraid to die, Robert.
Doing nothing terrifies me.
The path, and the pointer,
he left that all for you, Zobrist.
- You knew him?
- Knew him?
I loved him.
You're wearing his suit.
No.
Sienna, no.
Thank you, Robert.
Thank you for everything.
No. No.
Sienna, no!
Sienna!
No, Sienna!
Sienna, no!
Slow down, slow down.
You're too fast.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
This took me 3 days.
Too easy.
THE
GOLDEN
AGE
I love it.
A link before you exist,
an idea.
And now it's real.
Love awakens the soul to act.
That's not fair.
Quoting Dante to me.
But it's beauty, not love.
What?
It's a minute to midnight.
Sooner than I expected.
Where're we going?
Oh.
I see.
We planned it together,
we designed it together,
but this part
only belongs to you.
It's just safer if
you don't know where.
What if they find you first?
What then?
If you want to know,
you're not alone.
You got to start by trust me.
Unless we take bold immediate action
the sixth extinction
will be our own.
You were right.
I'm going to make
you another path.
Inferno will be at the end.
If something should happen to me,
the first clue will be deliver to you.
I know you'll do
what has to be done.
Seek and find.
You're not alone.
So.
The beautiful young woman
went for the bad guy.
That happens.
You look disappointed.
I'll give you a minute.
Elizabeth is not the one
who wants the virus to sell.
You are.
You've been used.
Elaborate schemes created by people
to get you to do what they want.
But me,
I'm very direct.
And this is a moment of
great opportunity for me.
So, where is the virus?
Come on, Professor.
How much life is
there in the world?
How much more is fighting
to be war?
Nothing wrong with thinning
the herd once in a while.
It's healthy.
I've seen many acts of god.
I mean, typhoons, cholera.
And you know what?
Sometimes it hits the right people.
- That's inhuman.
- Humanity is inhuman.
Life maybe cheap,
but if it means to add it on our scale,
no one ever stops
paying for that.
I'm going to ask you
for the last...
Terribly sorry.
Didn't see any other way.
Must do this quickly.
The less blood the better.
Who are you?
Oh, a facilitator.
Among other things
my company creates illusions.
You never had
a real head wound.
- But I lost my memory.
- Chemically induced.
We gave you an injection
of benzodiazapenes.
Sorry, it can produce a skin rash.
It should fade in a day or so.
All this was a...
This was a fake?
I prefer created reality.
My agents kidnapped you.
- They had to do it all real quickly.
- By killing me?
I apologize unreservedly, Mr. Langdon.
I did lose and
experience sees it.
It does a great deal of situation
I've employed in my line of work.
Look, hear me what I know.
I know I've behaved terribly.
But a puzzle needed solving,
who better to solve it than you.
Gladsome apparently.
Not my best work.
But it will do for the Italians.
Zobrist had followers everywhere
when Sienna first came to me for help.
Or so I thought.
She came to us with serious concerns
shortly after Zobrist died.
Somehow, she knew Zobrist hired us
She said he was doing biological work
that could be fallen into the wrong hands.
She didn't mention a plague.
But we heard enough to be alarmed.
So we agreed to work with her
to find Zobrist's project.
And when Dr. Sinskey brought you in,
we saw an opportunity.
It was Elizabeth
who came to see me.
Yes.
Dr. Sinskey got the Faraday pointer
from agent Bouchard.
She brought it
to you to decode,
and she even secured it
with your thumbprint.
That left us with no choice,
so we took you from her
on the street.
The hospital scenario encouraged you
to trust Dr. Brooks.
When you called to the Consulate
it was answered by our friend.
Professor Langdon?
Thank heavens you're alive.
We've been looking for you.
Are you still in possession?
You have the pointer,
we have you.
It was all working seamlessly
until Miss. Brooks stole you away.
To make sure
the virus is released.
It appears.
Young people are disappointing.
I find them become
tolerable around 35.
You're going to thank Dr. Sinskey.
I've been so worried.
Are you alright?
- I'm fine.
- Are you?
I'm okay.
I'm alright.
Thank god.
- Do you know where the virus is?
- Istanbul.
Now's the time.
Today is rebirth.
Inferno is salvation.
I am so sorry I brought
you into this, Robert,
- after all these years.
- No. I'm glad you did.
I met him, you know.
Zobrist, 2 years ago.
He asked for my help.
He wanted the WHO to
endorse mass sterilization
in drinking waters and staple foods.
So I threw him out of my office,
put him on the watch list.
He disappeared and...
I suppose that's when
he severed his ties since.
I should probably have... have
I don't know.
What?
You always blame yourself for things
that weren't your fault.
You're very sweet.
Here, a doorway.
I wish it would have happened differently,
back then.
We didn't look after it.
It fell apart.
Is that a regret?
Only when I think about it.
Would you have say the same things
happened in doorways,
at the borders,
right along the edges.
Ancient fishermen learned to sail
where the warm water met the cold.
The little fish would reach the edge
of the warm water and they stopped.
And the big fish would come out
of the cold water and they eat them.
And the fishermen.
Well, they caught everyone.
Doorways.
Not one part of you
has changed, Robert.
You talk too much.
And then,
not at all
Elizabeth.
I couldn't ask you
not to go to Geneva.
I couldn't.
I didn't want to ask you
to leave Cambridge.
Was that how it happened?
I don't trust my memory anymore.
I never forget anything.
Well, that's a gift.
No.
It isn't.
Leave him alone!
What are you doing?
Leave him alone!
Turn around!
Don't look at me!
Look away.
Don't look.
Robert!
I'm a friend of the poet.
For what did Zobrist die?
That others may live.
I've come very far to
make sure nothing interferes.
The delivery system we designed will discharge
the viral agent by midnight tonight.
But there are others who
are on their way to stop me.
I need to find it
before they do
and trigger an explosion
to ensure it's released.
How do we help?
During the Plague of Justinian,
in the streets in Istanbul.
A border between East and West.
Which is why he chose it.
If the bag is intact,
we can contain it.
But if someone ruptures it
before we get there
will be infected in 47 days.
Professor.
Doctor.
My name is Mirsat,
I'm the curator here.
Have you completely
evacuated the building?
Well, to the extent that we can
but the place is massive.
Could you tell me specifically
what it is you're looking for?
The tomb of Enrico Dandolo.
Of course, this way.
"Kneel within the
gilded museum of holy wisdom,
and listen for the sounds
of trickling water."
"Follow deep into the sunken palace."
I hear water flowing
through these stones.
Where does it go?
It's just drainage.
It goes to the city cistern.
We're looking for a large,
underground space,
perhaps with columns,
artificially lit from within.
That's simple.
The ancient system,
sixth century, Yerebatan Sarayi.
Also called, "The sunken palace."
Take us there.
His words can only
mean one thing.
Yerebatan Sarayi.
The Sunken Palace.
Once we descend, you'll see
exactly what he described.
How do I use it?
There's a cap
in the padial integrate.
The device also has a
detonation button.
A call from this cellphone
will trigger the explosion.
And that's enough
to break the bag?
The walls are cement all around.
You need both bombs, different angles,
as far apart as you can.
That's what break the bag.
History says the Black Plague
caused misery and death.
But, what they don't tell us,
is that it also produced a leaner population,
and gave birth to the Renaissance.
We are rushing as fast as we can
into the seventh circle of hell.
Suicidal but profitable.
Why is suffering later
preferable to suffering now?
What if we embrace it.
And then maybe pain can save us.
You're getting this, aren't you?
I can that you are.
Now I need to know
that I'm not alone.
Too many damn people.
He has chosen well.
I need schematics of all
conduits in and out of the cistern.
Full isolation and containment protocols.
Physical and chemical barriers along with...
Wait.
This is the city's water supply?
Oh, not anymore.
We've modernized.
But there is water.
Yes.
It eventually filters down into the earth.
Why are all these people here?
It is a tourist attraction.
The acoustics are excellent.
Tonight is the summer solstice concert,
very popular.
People come from all over
the world to hear it.
He created a bioaerosol.
So it will spread in the air.
- Empty the place.
- No.
Contain it.
Jam all communications down there.
No messages get in or out.
Got it.
Shall we go in?
Robert, you don't have to
come down, you know.
Yes, I do.
"Blood-red waters
of the lagoon that reflects no stars."
My god, this is a labyrinth.
How many sections?
There are dozens, Professor,
dozens.
Let's find it.
Check the other section.
Check them all.
Spread out.
Cut off cellphone service now.
- No communications.
- Yes, sir.
Here. This way.
Medusa.
Greek spirits, why?
It belongs to a specific category of
Greek spirits. Chthonic monsters.
- This is it?
- Yes.
The color, the columns, it's exactly
what we saw in the video
This is the area,
so spread out, check the pillars.
I'll take the wall lining.
Under the walkway.
Should you find anything,
report to me immediately.
Lives are at stake,
try to find it.
- What's going on?
- Sir, I need you to step aside.
I got it. It's here.
In this right corner.
Don't.
Hurry.
Quickly!
Sienna!
Sienna!
Sienna.
Sienna.
There are too many
of us down here!
You won't get to that
band before we do!
No.
But I can make sure it breaks.
Don't do this, Sienna, don't.
You'll be murdering innocents.
Yes.
People will die
a lot of them
and crisis will be averted.
It's what nature demands.
The problem won't suddenly slow down,
it should be solved permanently.
Killing billions to save lives.
That's the logic of tyrants.
- For the greater good, humanity...
- Geniuses don't come with special rights.
No, they come with the responsibility
to take action when others won't!
You want to do something, fine.
Then scream at the top of your lungs.
And invent and live.
If you loved humanity,
if you love this planet,
you would do anything
to save it.
The greatest sins in human history
were committed in the name of love.
No one will go down this act
and call it love.
They'll be alive.
What does it matter
what they say about us.
Don't shoot the box!
Robert.
Here.
Are you alright?
Fine.
Where's the box.
Where's the box.
It's contained, no breach.
The virus has been contained.
The target is contained,
be prepared for transport.
She thought she was
saving the world.
So did they all.
So, what will happen to the...?
We'll take it back to Geneva for test,
there will be an annunciation.
We'll have to generate
another gene sequences first
to get an idea
what we are dealing with.
There' a lot of work
to be done.
And you, Cambridge?
Yeah.
Dr. Sinskey?
Life tore us apart again.
Like Dante and Beatrice.
I have something for you.
I picked this up
the night you were taken.
I seem to remember
it was important to you.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Do you ever think
about what could have happened
for you and me?
I do.
I guess life must have
it's mysteries, Professor,
even for us.
- ' Scusati, do you speak English?
- Yes.
Have you seen Marta Alvarez,
the museum staff?
Marta isn't here just now.
She's had her baby.
She had her baby?
Aw, that is great.
Great news.
Well, you might tell someone that
the lights on the Dante mask
should be turned on.
Because I can barely see it.
I'm sorry, sir,
the Dante mask is no longer here.
It was stolen.
Really?
I was just looking at it.
Excuse me.
