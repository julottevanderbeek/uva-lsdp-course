At ease!
Salute!
Do-joon!
Hey, Benz! You asshole!
Do-joon, are you okay?
Oh no, blood!
Oh no, blood!
Do-joon, you're bleeding!
Shit, mom, get back in the store!
You're bleeding!
He's bleeding!
I knew it!
This is your own blood!
To the golf course.
Royal Palace Country Club!
Did they go there?
You idiot,
Where else in this town
would a Benz be going?
Is this hit-and-run?
Bastards who slam on the gas
after hitting someone
deserve to have
their faces slammed.
Look!
- I'm bleeding!
- All right, All right.
Plate number 5362...
White Benz...
It's 5293, idiot.
A black Benz, fuck.
Ah, a black Benz, black...
How could you mix up...
It could happen.
For you, it could...
That head of yours is special.
Oh, there it is!
That must've hurt.
Come on, stupid.
Enough, it's not a surgery.
What are you, a doctor?
Wait, don't move your finger.
What are you doing?
This is driving me crazy.
Where the heck has he gone?
It's a golf course.
Right. It's a golf course.
But you don't remember
why we came, do you?
Yay!
Twelve of them!
What does she see in you anyway?
Your mom?
Right, mom...
The car... Vroom.
Crash!
My blood!
This is revenge.
Right, we're here for revenge.
Anyway,
Where the fuck are
these Benz assholes?
They should have passed by now.
Wow, look!
What're you gonna do
with all those golf balls?
I'll give it to a girl.
You got someone to give it to?
Uh... Yeah.
You ever slept with a woman?
Idiot...
You with your pretty face.
I slept with a woman.
What woman?
Mom.
Where the fuck are they...
Come on!
They're here!
Revenge! Revenge!
What's that idiot doing?
What's with him?
Fucking assholes!
Stop the car! You!
What are you doing?
Who do you think you are?
What is this?
You shitheads!
Who was driving the car?
You hit-and-run bastards!
Who was driving? You?
What is this?
- What's gotten into you?
- Who was it?
Were you the one driving?
Excuse me.
This person is
too important to be here...
As I was saying, settlement
would be better for both of you.
After all, respected professors
such as yourselves
being involved in a hit-and-run...
And these two aren't
some kind of hustlers.
They're just local kids.
So we're going to settle, okay?
The hit-and-run and the assault
cancel each other out.
The verbal threats don't factor in.
Dean Kwon, the car...
They smashed my rearview mirror
in the parking lot.
A Mercedes Benz 280.
Aw fuck, why the hell
did you smash their mirror?
That'll cost a lot.
You bet.
Damn... Why did I do that?
You know how much that cost,
you dumb retard?
Retard?
What are you doing?
Let go! Let me go!
That bastard,
who does he think he is?
Sit down, Mister.
The mirror on a Benz...
That would cost...
A lot.
$1500? $2000?
Ah, here she comes...
Good afternoon, sir.
Eat up.
Eat.
Always eat well after
coming back from the police station.
Fuck...
I can feed myself.
I boiled this
with deodeok root and gugija.
It's good for your virility.
Really? My virility?
Why are you
so concerned about that?
Women.
Are you seeing someone?
Sure. Gonna sleep with her.
Sleep with her?
Who is it?
Gonna sleep with a woman.
How could you do that to
that Benz-whatever?
That expensive mirror?
Smash! With my foot.
It was revenge!
Good boy.
But I've got no money.
Where will I dig that up?
Whose yard will I dig it up in?
Why dig it up?
Just borrow it from Jin-tae.
Jin-tae!
Stay away from him.
Rotten kid.
He's from bad seed.
Okay.
Where are you going?
To meet Jin-tae.
You should finish dinner.
Have some medicine then.
You shouldn't skip medicine.
Do-joon, you didn't finish this.
Come home early!
Don't be late.
It doesn't hurt, right?
No, it's fine.
This won't hurt,
and I won't charge you for it.
So can you lend me some money?
How much?
It's really urgent.
And I'll give you medicine
instead of interest.
- Medicine?
- Yes!
To make you pregnant,
guaranteed effective.
Is there such a thing?
It really works.
I took some, and then
I got pregnant with Do-joon.
Your son will be
just as good-looking.
Do-joon...
His eyes are a work of art.
Like a deer's.
- Like mine?
- Yeah.
They're just like yours.
They're beautiful.
Anyway,
you're looking sexier these days...
- I mean...
- Yeah, whatever.
Why hasn't Jin-tae shown up?
He's not?
He should be here by now.
You've been saying that for hours.
Don't mess with me.
I just came back
from the police station.
Have some respect.
Jin-tae, where the hell are you?
Hurry up!
Go to bed, mom!
I'm staying up late.
I told you to go to sleep.
Good shot!
Hey, wake up.
Wake up!
Do something about him.
Did you have a nice sleep?
Wipe the spit off your face.
Goddamn freak,
piss off and go to hell.
Call your mom and tell her
to come pay the bill!
This is driving me crazy.
Do-joon!
Hey, I told you
to use the backstairs.
- Mina!
- How have you been?
Yeah, you wanna
have a drink with me?
Really?
- Turn around and march!
- Call me.
Okay, I'm going.
Shut up
and go do your homework.
That skirt is pretty.
You! Turn around!
Her legs are prettier.
Get your eyes off her!
Get out of here!
Please fuck off, okay?
Wait...
To pay for the drinks...
Expensive ones...
Hey!
Hey!
Where are you going?
How about you and me...
have a drink?
With a guy... Don't want to?
You don't like guys?
So late...
What was her name, Ah-jung?
It's Moon Ah-Jung.
Seorin Girls' High School,
second year, fourth class.
You called her house?
She has guardians?
There's a grandmother,
but she's a real loon.
Always walking around with
a rice liquor bottle in her fist,
making a scene.
So the kid is the guardian.
She takes care of her grandma.
Anyway, how long has it been
since we had a murder case?
It's the first since I came here.
Has it been that long?
Yep.
The crime scene seems intact.
It is.
Quite a picture, huh?
Cops these days...
You know, CSI and all that on TV.
They all watch it.
The forensics team
is pretty sharp, too.
Anyway,
a rain shower passed earlier.
So things must be
pretty mucked up.
I suppose.
Anyway, it must have been
a blunt object.
A fractured cranium,
lots of blood...
What's with this?
Didn't this come in last week?
God, that smell...
Yeah, well...
This smells like a rotting corpse.
My god!
Look at this if you're not blind.
And the appearance...
People are going to think
they're from China.
Ma'am, these are from China.
Hey!
Give me a break.
Don't even mention China.
Besides, Chinese imports
aren't that bad.
Don't tell me...
You're still giving acupuncture
without a license?
No, no way!
My husband is a public official.
You know how much trouble
we'll be in?
Sure, I know.
He'll be promoted soon,
so let's not cause any trouble.
Last year, do you know how hard
it was to cover for you?
You think only you will
get in trouble?
It will ruin my family completely.
Listen when someone's
talking to you.
Mom!
Do-joon! Do-joon!
Mom!
Get down!
Oh geez...
She's a good runner.
Yoon Do-joon, you're charged with
the murder of Moon Ah-jung.
You have the right to remain silent
but there's no way
you'll be able to afford a lawyer.
There she is.
Not that she can
afford to do anything.
Can't you drive, idiot?
Are you hurt anywhere?
Turn your head.
Your head isn't hurt?
Turn your head around.
Why is he...
- A dog?
- Dog...
- A wolf?
- Dog...
It's usually hot here.
We're all guys here,
so take that off.
Your pants too, okay?
- Pants?
- Take off your pants, it's okay.
This isn't police torture.
I'm taking my pants off too.
It feels good.
Anyway Do-joon,
Have you heard of Sepaktakraw?
- You have, right?
- No.
Only likes mainstream sports,
the fucker.
Bite it!
Come here and bite it.
That's right, turn around.
The sin always turns around.
Stand straight. Close your eyes.
Don't move or you'll get hurt.
Bite it hard!
Did you see it?
I bet not.
This is power of Sepaktakraw.
It's one of the basic moves.
From now on, if you don't
answer clearly yes or no,
I'll kill you right here.
I'll be watching you.
Do-joon,
what did you do last night?
Hey, spit out the apple.
What did you do?
I had a drink...
Where?
- Manhattan.
- That's right. And then?
I slept at home.
You slept, of course.
But before that, I mean...
At home, no,
after drinking at Manhattan
on your way home,
what did you do?
The lady at Manhattan said
you were like a dog in heat.
Her daughter, what's her name?
- Mina.
- Right. Mina.
You were hitting on her?
Well, I...
Answer clearly!
I slept at home. With mom.
- That's simple.
- You sleep with your mom?
You don't have to answer.
Anyway,
you say you don't remember
but everyone remembers you.
There was a guy who saw you
while feeding his dog.
You were following
after Moon Ah-jung.
Heading towards
the scene of the murder.
Isn't that right?
I don't remember...
You wanna
die here right now, punk?
We've got plenty of apples.
- Open your mouth.
- Never mind that.
You know,
we also found something
next to the body.
Why didn't you put up
a marker next to the body?
With your name written right on it.
- Don't laugh.
- Do-joon,
Just between us...
Why did you do it?
On personal level,
I'm really curious.
So did you want to do it
with Moon Ah-jung?
We need to know why,
then the judge can be lenient.
Maybe we can
do something for you.
He's asking this
for your own benefit.
Do-joon.
To be honest,
you're not the kind of person
to commit murder.
Not everyone
is able to kill someone.
You've never been a bad kid.
I can be bad.
Jesus...
Right, anyone can commit murder.
It's not like you need a license.
Anyway,
you don't know the motive,
but you killed her, right?
The fact that you killed her,
that's what's important.
He confessed.
Anyway, this document contains
all the details of the case, see?
Check it over.
But you can read, right?
Want me to read it for you?
I can read.
Sure, anyway, don't just sign it
without reading it.
Check the contents, and sign.
Read it well.
Why did you do it!
How could you do that?
They hit you?
The cops beat you, didn't they?
Where did they hit you?
An apple...
Apple
Apple
Do-joon,
at times like this,
you need to focus your mind.
Focus. Take a deep breath.
Do-joon...
Everyone says I killed her.
Breathe like me.
And so...
the sin turns around
a few times
- and comes back to me.
- What are you mumbling about?
Did you really sign
that confession?
Why? Why? Why?
Even if you really did it,
you have to deny it.
If I killed her, I should admit it.
Did you kill her?
Are you crazy? Of course not.
Then why did you sign it, idiot!
Don't call your son an idiot!
Je-mun,
How could you
of all people do this to him?
You know him,
he couldn't even hurt a water bug.
A water bug...
Wipe off your face first.
Je-mun,
here's some of the camphor ginseng
you used to take in high school.
You said it helped you think clearly.
- Take it.
- Listen.
From early morning,
I'm going to be up dealing
with the Juhwang county
robbery case.
And... that crazy kid JP ran away
from the sanatorium
on Mt. Dogye.
I gotta go there and then...
I know, I know
how busy you are, but...
What I mean is...
regarding Do-joon,
his case is closed, okay?
Do you understand?
It's finished, 100%.
Bastard,
you sure were having fun.
I left early, you ass.
Excuse me, people. Step aside.
What the hell are you doing?
What's inside this thing anyway?
Put it down there.
Turn it over.
What in god's name
are you doing?
Are you kidding me?
Turn the damn thing over.
Mister, don't touch it!
Actually I'm not a relative,
but I'm close to them.
Sir!
If there's a reason
you believe he's not guilty, tell us.
If you read through this here,
you see this golf ball?
The golf ball has
already been reported.
What's this?
'Apple-biting human rights abuses'?
Mister, please read it
before throwing it away.
Read it carefully first,
then throw it away.
It's my only son.
Is she crazy?
Why is that woman here?
Who?
Yoon Do-joon's mother...
No...
How the hell could you?
Are you out of your mind?
I'm just...
As a member of this community
I wanted to pay my respects.
You came to apologize?
For your son?
Does that make sense?
Actually, my son didn't do it.
Listen everyone,
regardless what the world may think,
you of all people
must understand!
It wasn't my son!
She's completely insane!
Hey bitch!
How could you
bring your ugly face here?
Throw some salt at her!
I just wanted to tell you
that my son is innocent.
Stop it!
What do you mean he's innocent?
It was your son, Yoon Do-joon!
- The murderer!
- Bring back our Ah-jung!
Bring her back to us!
Let's talk civilly!
Bring Ah-jung back to life!
- It's a misunderstanding!
- Misunderstanding my ass!
Let go!
What's there to discuss?
How could she dare?
Shut up you fuckers!
What's this god damn racket?
Fucking bitches.
How could you
raise such a rotten son?
That goddamn son of a bitch!
Don't curse my son.
I won't stand for it!
Rip that bitch's tongue out!
Don't hate him!
I won't...
This place has the best seafood.
You know everything, don't you?
It's true.
Shall we sit down here?
When I come to a buffet,
I never sit down.
Don't run!
I just keep scooping it up
and eating it.
Yes of course,
because you're so busy.
I save time that way.
This is the lawyer, Gong Suk-ho.
Say hello to him.
Do-joon,
Tuck your shirt in.
That side, too.
It looks better this way.
Does it?
Are you getting
along well enough here?
Yes,
the food is good.
The rice with beans
is better than I thought.
Rice with beans?
That's what prisoners eat.
Do-joon!
The most important thing is
what you remember that night.
However small a detail,
just tell him what you can think of.
You understand?
What you saw, what you heard,
even what you smelled,
tell him everything in detail.
Anyway, you need to try
really hard to remember.
That's your only task in here.
Isn't that right?
Right.
Yes, do this.
Is this some kind of exercise?
No, we call it
the Temples of Doom.
From childhood,
whenever he does this
it helped him remember.
- So for memory?
- Yes, for memory.
Yes, it's some kind of,
what do you call it...
acupressure.
Oh, I remember!
What?
I didn't do it.
It wasn't me!
That's right!
Of course you didn't kill her.
No,
not that.
I didn't kick it off, the mirror!
On the Benz... Jin-tae...
It was Jin-tae who did it.
I went whoosh!
And he went crunch!
Sir.
Let me explain.
What he is saying is...
It's a long story.
Wait!
I just got an urgent message
from the office.
I need to go.
Then what about us?
For a first meeting,
this is enough.
- Should I Call you?
- I'll call you.
Then when will you call?
Sir...
What?
Did he leave?
He doesn't like us, does he?
He's a very busy man.
The most expensive lawyer
in our county.
Damn, wasn't there
anything else to tell him?
I should have said more.
Right, who cares about
the mirror?
But, you mean
it was Jin-tae who did it?
I knew it.
That rotten little scoundrel.
That jerk never came
to visit me even once.
But Do-joon,
that night, didn't you go out
to meet Jin-tae?
Then you never met him.
And the golf balls,
he knew about those, right?
Good afternoon.
I've come to see Attorney Gong.
He's not in now.
His car is outside.
He's really not here.
He is, isn't he?
Oh, Mr. Gong! Excuse me!
Oh, look who's here!
- Sir, I...
- Yes?
- Miss Kim, some green tea!
- What I'd like to say is...
If he's here, why can't I...
Ma'am,
would you prefer coffee?
To be honest,
about your case,
we are proceeding
slowly and methodically.
Here, have some.
I understand you feel impatient.
But what can we do?
You just need to wait patiently.
But we need to open an investigation
on Do-joon's friend, Jin-tae!
Ma'am!
Let me be honest with you.
In monetary terms,
if this were Seoul,
the fee we're charging
wouldn't cover an assault case
involving two broken teeth.
You should understand that.
Son of a bitch.
Blood...
Stop.
I said stop.
Let me look at this first.
Let me take this off first.
- Cooperate a little.
- Just a sec.
Okay, okay.
There you go.
Shit, this is the climax.
Spa-ghet-ti!
Ti-ra-mi-su!
Tsu-na-mi!
Mi-ner-al!
Al-arm!
Arm-a-dil-lo!
Where's Je-mun?
- Detective Nam Je-mun.
- What's the problem?
Out of my way.
Push this.
She put way too much on.
Isn't that...
the Manhattan lady's daughter?
Is this what you do together?
Lucky bastard.
Watch this part, here.
That's what it is, lipstick?
But do you play golf?
Me, golf?
Those professors
gave it to me when they left.
Excuse me. Sir?
Do we really have to call
the forensics team?
Anyone can tell
this is just lipstick.
All right,
tell them not to bother.
Wait!
Take an umbrella.
Wait a minute.
I went to pick you up
at the station.
Please get in.
Attorney Gong wants to see you.
Welcome, ma'am.
We started without you.
You, wait outside.
Have a seat.
You've had quite a day today.
I heard it from the police chief.
I feel so sad for you.
It's the first time I've seen
you sitting down.
Ah, you have a fine wit.
Pass her a drink.
Ma'am, do you remember
the 2002 World Cup?
The Red Devils,
Gus Hiddink!
Four years passed in a flash
I could still feel
the excitement of 2002.
But then suddenly
it was 2006.
The Germany World Cup!
Four years
is no time at all, I mean.
I really don't understand
what you're saying.
Regarding Do-joon,
let's send him off
for just four years.
It'll be a hospital, not a jail,
and he won't
have to serve 15 years.
Ma'am!
We need to think realistically.
Four years in a mental institution
for this case is a legal jackpot!
Music!
Ma'am.
I forgot to introduce you.
To my right,
my high school classmate,
the president of
Agape Psychiatric Hospital,
Doctor Yoon Jong-gu!
Hey, wake him up?
And next to me
my bar exam classmate,
Attorney Park Jong-pyo!
He's handsome.
What? Are you holding a protest?
He's smashed
after just a few drinks.
Mr. Gong!
Look, my son is...
Do-joon!
Why are you so late?
You've been drinking, haven't you?
It's so late...
Did you eat?
Eat?
I was wondering if you ate.
Thanks so much for asking.
Anyway,
I feel so fucking betrayed.
How could you
do this to me, bitch!
Jin-tae, I did a terrible thing.
Forget that.
Just pay me $5000
as a settlement.
In cash.
All I have right now...
it's not much...
Wait...
I've been saving this
to pay back my debt.
Take this for now.
Okay.
Send the rest to my bank account.
I'll text you the account number.
You know what texting is?
