You have any party drugs?
Whoo!
Yeah, let's go party.
Shark!
Shark!
No, guys, there's a shark!
There's a shark in the water!
Drops, don't!
You guys beat
the Coast Guard here.
This is my first shark call out.
- You?
- What do you think?
The victim's name
is Desiree McQuire.
She's 28.
She's a cocktail waitress
here at the Golden Nugget.
Today was her day off.
Little jumpy, David?
Booby-trapped bodies,
a shark in a swimming pool.
I'm a little jumpy, yeah.
How we gonna get it out of there,
so we can get her out of there?
I think I can answer that.
You see Jacques Cousteau
over there?
He's the aquatic veterinarian.
Okay, well, maybe
he can share with us
how a shark got into this pool.
- Excuse me!
- Dr. Holloway.
Catherine Willows.
Nice to meet you.
You, too.
How soon can we get
the shark out of here?
I need to get my victim
out of the pool.
Well, just give us
a few minutes to pull it out.
Saltwater tiger shark
in a freshwater pool
is a lethal combination.
Shark population
worldwide is in decline
without crazy stuff like this.
All right, guys, let's go.
Let's see if we can save her.
Higher, higher.
I don't know what to tell you.
Shark got tired of entertaining the guests
and busted out of the tank.
Well, Conrad, it's 120 degrees
out here and we're pulling
a young dead woman
out of the pool.
That's it, that's all
I got for you right now.
Hey, sorry, I'm late.
I had an appointment.
I heard it over the squawk.
What's going on?
You kidding me?
I got enough problems
in the casino.
Now I got people
going out in body bags?
Besides me,
who's in charge here?
CSI Willows.
This is Nick Stokes.
Willows?
You're Sam's little girl, right?
No, I'm a big girl, telling you
to step behind the tape
before I have you arrested.
Just like your old man.
Always got his way,
one way or the other.
You should discuss
this someplace else.
I got it, Nicky.
Mr. Boozell,
we're here to investigate.
This is an active crime scene.
I wouldn't even let
the sheriff past that tape,
so consider
this conversation a luxury.
Let us do our job,
and then you can go back doing yours.
Sam's little girl.
So that's Earnest Boozell, huh?
The "Booze"?
Biggest shark in Vegas.
So, all the sharks
arrived from back of house,
most from Eastern waters,
off the Keys, Montauk, Costa Rica.
They arrive via truck,
in water tanks.
They're humanely transported.
I put them in the aquarium,
help them survive the shock.
Now they're in show business.
Well, I guess that's one way
to make a living.
How many tiger sharks do you
have in your tank currently?
Well, we try to keep it
to three or four.
Any more than that and they
start to turn on each other.
Let's put it this way--
it's a very challenging
little ecosystem.
All right, well,
I'm gonna ask the obvious.
Is there a tiger shark
that's missing from this tank?
Well, Mr. Boozell
wants you to know that,
no, all tiger sharks
are accounted for.
He also wants you to know
that this aquarium right here
is built with eight inches of Plexiglas
and uses a completely different
plumbing system than the pool.
He also wants you to know
that if you don't
take his word for it,
you can just suit up
and see for yourself.
I do count four tiger sharks
in the tank.
Just like it says
in the manifest there. Four.
Thank you, Dr. Holloway.
Hey, CSIs, tick-tock.
Your time is my money.
Still here?
How's my day club?
Up and running yet?
If you want me to break down
the financials for you,
I'll be glad to do it.
I'll do it, anyway.
My night club makes three to five million
on a sold-out weekend.
The day club, H2O,
does seven to ten million.
Not to mention the mil
that they drop inside.
It's just like this town: One minute
you're flush, the next you're bust.
Spoken just like
a true mogul's daughter.
What made you become a cop?
I happen to love my job,
and could you please
leave my father out of this?
Well, I love my job, too,
and I got to get back to it.
The manifests don't lie.
It's clear that the shark in the
pool did not come from my tank.
Well, it had to
come from somewhere.
Well, maybe it checked in
last night, VIP.
No, VIS-- Very Important Shark.
He checked in, took a dip
in the pool this morning,
had a bite to eat.
Now he's on the hook for murder.
All right, you're right, sir.
Your manifest did check out,
but we're far from done.
Now we need access
to your surveillance.
All of it.
- Thank you.
- Thank you!
Wait, no, no, no, no.
Pool's closed, ladies.
Let's just go across
the street to Macklin's.
We're losing sun.
Last of the lookiloos?
Yeah, yeah.
Now it sounds like everybody's
going to the pool across the street.
Well, I just came from
the Eye in the Sky.
I had security run
the outdoor cameras
leading up to the
time of the attack.
There are no signs of anyone
dropping a shark into the pool.
But the cameras inside the casino
are a lot better than out here.
Half of this pool
is covered in a blind spot.
Yeah, well, maybe somebody
knew that, you know?
Maybe it's an inside job.
This is pretty easy access.
Back door leading
from the house right to the... pool.
I got to say,
it's a great place to get high.
Yeah, not a bad place to
smuggle in a shark, either.
- Hey, there.
- Hey.
Welcome back.
So how was Spokane?
It was your niece, wasn't it?
It was Portland.
It was my sister.
And it was good.
-
- Oh.
Oh, Catherine.
I swear to God, all she does
is buzz me all day.
I wanted to pick up where we left off.
Okay.
Dinner?
I can't, I'm really busy.
But can we definitely talk later?
- Sure, yeah, sure.
-
Oh, Catherine again.
Uh, I got to go,
but we'll talk later?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Hey, Catherine, hello.
Hey, yeah...
I thought I heard you coming.
Back on the rails.
Steady, thanks to you.
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted, Captain.
This our girl?
Desiree McQuire, 28.
Arm's missing.
Got a hunch where it went,
but that is the aquatic vet's
purview, not mine.
C.O.D. exsanguination?
Seems obvious.
Well, a shark tooth.
Not a drop of blood on it.
Clean as a whistle.
No blood on the puncture.
Tells me the tissue
lacks vital response,
which means
there was no blood flowing
through the tissue
when she was bitten.
According to David's report,
she bled out in the pool.
Well, then,
blood had to be flowing.
How can both things be true?
Been a while, Drops.
That's your ganja, man.
And that's enough
to put you right back
in a ten-by-eight cell.
Let me guess.
One of your fancy
machines fingered me?
Yeah, so, uh, what now?
You guys going to
charge me with smoking?
- I like murder better.
- Murder?
Nick, help me out here.
Hey, don't look at me, man.
I'm not the one
that got you in this mess.
That blunt puts you
in the one blind spot
where a shark
could have been put
into the water, and according
to Human Resources,
you had access
to the service area, which is
right next to the pool.
A young woman was killed.
That makes you
a co-conspirator.
To a shark?
Yeah.
Man, you Columbos got this all wrong.
I promote Boozell's day clubs.
That's why I have all access,
and the area behind the pool
is where we bring in
the DJ equipment.
Do you guys have any idea
how hard it is to get a job
when you get out the pen?
Boozell took a chance on me
after I was laid off
from my first gig.
Why would I blow that?
The job or the blunt?
Come on, now, got a wife
and kid to support.
And it's not like Macklin's
going to take me back.
You used to work across
the street at Macklin's?
I used to promote his day clubs.
I mean, until I got fired for nothing.
Okay, Macklin's got
an aquarium, sharks,
and a day club
that would benefit
- from Boozell's bad luck.
- Wait a minute.
So you think that I put
that shark in that pool
for a guy who fired me?
No, but you and I
both know that if the price is
right, you'd look the other way.
I mean, you do have a wife
and a kid to support. You said it.
And if there's one guy who just
can't stay out of jail...
it's you.
Why would this Drops kid
bite the hand that feeds him?
I gave him a job right after
Macklin threw him out.
And my day club
went through the roof.
I'm not one for puns,
but it sounds like you're fishing.
Maybe I am testing
the waters a bit,
trying to get
a little background.
Let's be cards up on this.
Your daddy used to say that.
The rivalry between
you and Macklin,
to insiders like me,
is a bedtime story.
I know all about Macklin's
signature property,
the Big Dragon going off,
rattling the windows
of your casino,
and you barging into his office,
demanding that he turn it down.
And what did he do?
He made it even louder.
So, when Macklin built
his topless Euro pool,
you put up a tower that blocked
all of his customers' sun.
What's the problem?
You both have day clubs,
pools, sharks,
and a rivalry that goes back
to when Bugsy set foot
in the desert.
You don't think I put
the shark in my own pool?
That doesn't make sense.
You know the financials.
They just w-walk
across the street.
Macklin.
I'm gonna kill him.
Bit of free advice.
Never say that
in front of a cop.
Shark bites a woman's arm off,
severs the brachial artery.
What happens?
She's going to bleed out
into the pool, period.
Which leads us
back to the tooth,
which shows no evidence of
inflammation or any hemorrhaging
in the surrounding soft tissue
where you found it.
Which could only mean she was dead
before the shark ever took a bite.
All right, so if she was dead
before she was bitten,
a shark bites
a dead woman's arm off,
severs an artery.
What happens?
She's going to bleed out
into the pool.
Why? Because the artery's
like a pipe.
The blood's got to go somewhere.
Okay, okay, both things are true.
Our victim did not die
of a shark attack.
We are still looking for C.O.D.
Any other signs of trauma
on the body?
Not on the front.
I guess we're gonna
have to flip her.
All righty.
All right.
Oh, injection mark.
Looks like a large-gauge needle.
It would be impossible
to inject yourself
in the middle of
your back like this.
What color was the raft?
Catherine said coral.
Coral it is.
According to ,
it only takes
a drop of blood to attract a shark
from a hundred miles away.
Which would explain
why Desiree was singled out
by the shark.
That means the shark is only
guilty of biting a dead woman.
Our killer's still out there.
Dr. Ray, it's good
to have you back.
Good to be back, Henry.
Got C.O.D. on
your shark victim.
You were right.
Acute opiate toxicity.
It was a heroin overdose.
Based on metabolites,
she was a first-time user.
- So her first dose was also her last.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, there's obviously
a ton of people in the pool,
and all the angles are terrible.
I do have some shots of Desiree,
but from the time she got on
the raft until she was attacked,
there's no clear shots
of Desiree or her killer.
She's wearing
an awful lot of bling
to be hanging by the pool.
Yeah, right?
Yeah, hang on a second.
She rolls into the pool
looking like Paris Hilton,
but when she comes out,
she's lost her life
and all her jewelry.
Her arm was
devoured by a shark,
which means she was
thrashed about a bit.
So maybe the rest of her jewelry
is at the bottom of the pool.
You and Wendy talk?
Yeah, we talk all the time.
Why?
You talk to Wendy?
It's more like she talks to me.
It's not that serious.
She comes to me, we talk.
You know, friends.
W-Wait.
W-What kind of friends?
Friend friends
or friends with benefits?
Well, define "benefits."
Um...
I'll load up
and meet you out front.
Is this the "talk later" part?
- Yeah.
- Is it about Henry?
No.
Is it about me?
It's about you and me.
I got a new job.
That's great.
What, they gonna send you
out in the field, or...
It's in Portland with my sister.
Not in Spokane with my niece.
And I get to be a field mouse.
Not a lab rat.
Wow.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Does anybody
else know about this?
Um, yeah.
Yeah, Catherine was nice enough
to make a couple phone calls for me.
And, um, Henry...
he gave me some advice.
I'm leaving, Hodges.
Yeah.
And I'm the last to know.
Yeah, you're the last to know
because I wanted it that way,
because I knew that
if I told you sooner,
you would get really upset,
and then you'd blame Henry,
and you'd try to get me to stay.
And I can't.
Wendy...
Good-bye.
D-Don't.
This is Macklin.
I see.
Strawberry blond, all business.
I think I found her.
Still paging?
Now, that's old school.
I consider myself new school,
but paging is vintage Vegas.
Danny Macklin.
Catherine Willows, CSI.
Please.
CSI, huh?
Let me guess.
The Booze couldn't keep
the sharks in his tank,
and now he's blaming me.
Well, as you know, Mr. Macklin,
day clubs are the hottest ticket in town,
unless of course,
you have a shark-infested pool.
And I know that you have
a stable of sharks.
Would you like to
count my sharks?
Because I can tell you that
if there's a shark missing,
I'd be the first to know.
Yes, but would you tell me?
You know, I wouldn't
put it past the Booze
to drop a shark in his own pool
and try to finger me for it.
Not exactly the smartest ace
in the deck.
More of a joker, actually.
Well, joke's on him,
because his dollars are walking
right through my front door.
Which makes you the prime suspect.
That's enough business.
Why don't, um--
Why don't we get some lunch, huh?
We got a great shark fin soup here.
Can I order you some?
That's one of the biggest reasons
sharks are becoming extinct.
I'll pass.
Thanks for your time, Mr. Macklin.
How long did you know?
Know what?
Wendy was leaving.
She asked my opinion
a couple months ago.
I told her it was a
great opportunity.
So, basically,
you pushed her out the door.
You going to Portland, too,
Mr. Friends With Benefits?
Look, Hodges, as
much as you think
it's a one-way street,
it wasn't, all right?
I can't help that
she comes to me
'cause she can't talk to you.
Henry, you might
want to shut up now.
Seriously, you're gonna blame me?
Dude, you're the one
that couldn't close.
- Henry.
- No, you took her out for coffee, right?
And then you can't take her home,
'cause you live at home.
What are you going
to tell your mom,
"Take a ride around the block"?
That's it!
- This is all your fault!
- What are you doing?
Henry?
Henry?
- Henry!
-
I found the murder weapon.
Good eyes.
Run this through tox.
I want to make sure
it's the same needle
that injected heroin
into our victim.
Okay. As long as you keep
Hodges away from me.
I think I got swimmer's ear.
Hmm?
From-- Forget it.
Hey, Jim, it's Nick.
We need to pick up a woman--
Anya Sanchez, FHA,
last known address-- 27321 Barlow.
She's got quite a rap sheet.
I think this may be our girl.
Come on. That's Cartier.
No, no, no, no.
That's robbery.
And this is
your second strike, right?
I mean, that's--
that's quite a pile.
Looks like there's
a few strikes in there.
Then again, all we need
is three, right?
Come on, you guys.
Come on.
I know this game, all right?
You bring me in here.
You lean on me.
You try to get me to plea.
You like that?
You got a Patek Philippe?
I don't know. I'll Check.
- You want to keep that?
- Sure.
How about you take a bracelet
for your little girlfriend?
I got a girlfriend, too.
Be my guest.
Okay.
It's not that easy.
It could be, really.
I don't think you realize
how much trouble you're in.
Do you recognize this girl?
Her name's Desiree McQuire.
I mean, you should.
You're in possession
of her necklace, her rings...
and I think these
are her bracelets.
And I'm going to go out
on a limb here and...
those gold hoop earrings--
those are hers, too.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah,
I've been a bad girl.
I admit I got sticky fingers
sometimes, so...
print me, book me, whatever it is.
I'm just going to post bail
and take a few days
off work, so...
You'll need more
than a couple days.
I know how you robbed her.
You injected her with heroin.
When she was knocked out,
you picked her clean.
The tough spot is,
your fingerprint
was on the syringe.
And let me guess.
That was a new batch
of heroin, right?
Well, you know...
the weekend cleaned me out,
so I had to improvise.
So I got it from a new seller,
but I didn't sell it,
so... it's just robbery.
Right?
No. No, unfortunately,
Miss McQuire died...
of a heroin overdose.
It's felony murder.
You gave her a hot shot, hotshot.
You're right.
You've been a bad girl.
Brass ran Anya Sanchez's
for credit cards.
She's been renting out cabanas
at every pool party in town.
She had quite an attitude
till she realized
she'd gone from thief to murderer,
but I don't think she had anything
to do with our shark attack.
Two separate events.
Yeah, sounds like it.
So we're still chasing the idiot
who put the shark in the water.
Which is attempted murder
on everyone in Boozell's pool.
All right,
based on her condition,
I'd say she's a young one.
No more than five or six.
Under normal circumstances,
not exposed to the pool's
filtration system,
she could have lived
another 30 years.
Doctor, care to do the honors?
Why not?
Dr. Langston.
Thank you.
That's-- That's better.
See if you can get
those spreaders in there.
Okay.
That is one huge gut.
She is an eating machine.
- All right. You mind if I take a look?
- Be my guest.
All right, let's see what we got.
Now, this shark
is definitely from the wild.
You can tell by the
species she was eating.
You got mackerel...
Here we go. Excuse me.
And some eel.
A little squid.
Ah. Got, uh,
even some baby shark.
Zebra, blacktip.
Found off the Florida Keys.
What I cannot tell you
is how she got here.
There are collectors
who capture sharks
out of the ocean.
They're legit if they have permits.
But the sharks
are almost impossible to track.
Well, thank you, Dr. Holloway.
You've been very helpful.
Gentlemen.
Helpful?
He's not a  watcher.
Most aquariums get their sharks
from captive breeding programs.
Right.
Hmm.
Where does a wild shark
get freshly-cut pieces of fish?
The doctor's a liar.
You know, I've taken the
tour at Mandalay Bay.
You know, the one with
the audio guide to your ear.
- I hate those things.
- I love them.
You learn stuff.
Sharks in captivity have to be tagged.
It's like bringing a D.B.
into autopsy without a toe tag.
I am telling you, this shark was
shark-napped out of some casino.
I believe you, Doc.
You ever known shark
skin to be smooth?
Feel that... right there.
Hmm. It's almost as if it was sanded down.
Well, if you can do it
with the VIN number of a car,
why not a shark?
Genus--
Species--
G.C.
So the first two letters of the I.D.
are genus and species.
Right.
The next two numbers denote
the year that the shark
was purchased.
And 0-3 means it
was the third tiger shark
purchased for that
particular aquarium.
And there are only a handful
of aquariums in Vegas
that have sharks.
I've got the list right here.
And I think I know
who I'm going to talk to first.
Well, Mr. Macklin,
that is your shark.
At least, it was your shark
until it took a dip
in Mr. Boozell's pool.
And, Mr. Macklin,
let me remind you
of your own words.
"If there's a shark
missing from my property,
I'd be the first to know."
Here's the thing.
As of, uh, yesterday,
I'm not missing a shark.
But, last week,
I had a shark with a tapeworm.
Excuse me?
Yeah, I got a $50,000 shark
that's eating me out of house and home,
eating all my baby sharks.
Do you know how much it costs
to ship a zebra
or blacktip to Vegas?
- How much?
- 15 grand a fish. Yeah.
And this tiger shark is eating
them up like potato chips.
See, my goal on my property
is to provide a tranquil aquarium
for my guests as they check in.
And instead, I've got
a 200-pound eating machine
that's tearing up my tank
before my guests can even get
their freaking key cards.
So I, uh, checked the shark out early.
I got rid of it.
- How did you get rid of it?
- I called my guy,
the guy who takes care of my fish.
- Um... Aquavet.
- Dr. Holloway.
He handles all the properties.
He came by, picked it up.
Oh, and, uh,
speaking of my words,
it went a little something like this...
"You get that disposal
with a fin off my property,
before I turn it
into a buffet special."
- I got something to say!
- You gotta be kidding me!
You think I don't know cops with cell phones?
Who do you think dimed you out
to let me know you're here?
I'm on to you, Macklin.
I want a piece of you.
You feelin' tough?
You want a piece of me? Okay...
- You want too far this time with that shark.
- You just keep talking.
- You crossed the line.
- It's all going on record. You keep talking.
Gentlemen!
This interview's over.
Escort them out of here.
Come on, let's go.
Talk about shark-infested waters.
Bring it back when you
take the boot off.
Send a stretch.
Yeah, Catherine, we got a bead
on Dr. Holloway.
His office said he's working
at Macklin's property,
but we can't seem
to get him on the phone,
so he must be in the water.
We'll call you as soon as we
find out something else.
There you are.
Mom, Mom, I got it.
It's so cool.
I got a great picture!
Come on!
Awfully fired up about taking
a picture of a fish.
Well, you know,
fish are beautiful.
- Not when you're sleeping with them.
- It's Dr. Holloway.
Well, that explains
why his cell phone
went straight to voice mail.
First blush?
Pink.
What caused it?
Could be carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, cyanide.
Dealer's choice, pal.
Hey. Where do you want this?
Why don't you
put it in my mouth
and shoot it
with a high-powered rifle?
No way, man.
Last thing I need's
another explosion.
I'm just starting
to get my hearing back.
I got to buck up.
I got to get my shark face on.
Get tough.
Good. You know, I have
a tough job for a tough guy.
Excellent.
I need to keep my mind off Wendy.
Okay, test the contents
of the tank with quants, please.
Want to give me a heads up,
let me know what I'm looking for?
Whatever turned our suspect
into the Pink Panther.
Mmm.
Hey. Hey.
I found the pink culprit.
It's CO poisoning--
carbon monoxide.
Someone tampered
with Holloway's scuba tank.
I can tell you how.
Also found hydrocarbons
and nitrous oxides.
Both are by-products
of an internal combustion engine.
You're saying somebody filled
his scuba tank
with car exhaust?
Well, it's not that hard really.
You just take
the compressor intake,
put it next to the exhaust,
and you're in business.
Even one percent of carbon
monoxide can kill you.
It binds 200 times tighter
to hemoglobin than oxygen,
preventing the O2
from being distributed
and absorbed by the body.
And you suffocate.
Yeah, and you turn pink.
We know that
it was Macklin's shark
that ended up in Boozell's pool.
Probably put there by Dr. Holloway,
who worked
for both Macklin and Boozell.
So, who stood to gain more
by the doctor's untimely death,
the Booze or the Mack?
Let's run both scenarios.
I'm the Mack.
I call up the aqua vet and I say,
"Hey, man, you wanna make
a little extra cash?
"Sand the number
off the reject shark from my tank,
"throw it in Boozell's pool
"so I that I can steal
all his customers.
Only don't tell the cops."
Oops.
Or I'm the Booze,
and I call the aqua vet and I say,
"Hey, I know Macklin paid you
"to put that shark
into my pool to ruin me.
You're a dead man."
Who's got better motive?
We let the evidence decide.
Ask the gentlemen
to start their engines.
I think I can narrow
that down a bit.
Based on the ratio
of contaminants
found in the exhaust,
we're looking for an older car.
Pre-'70s... vintage.
Okay, Joe.
Everyone in Vegas knows
that you have a collection
of classic cars.
You parade them up and down
the Strip every year.
Your '64 Aston Martin
is pre-catalytic converter.
Puts out plenty of carbon monoxide.
The ratios of hydrocarbons
and nitrous oxides matches
the ratios that we found
in Dr. Holloway's scuba tank.
Willows, I flunked science.
Are you trying to say
that my car killed Holloway?
Why would it do that?
Because you knew
that Macklin gave back a shark,
and you knew who he gave it to--
the aqua vet.
And you figured
that Macklin and the aqua vet
were in cahoots,
so you had him whacked.
You want to talk old school,
that's dinosaur times.
I'd rather not state the obvious,
but my hotel is hot,
crawling with cops.
I can't walk through my casino
without bumping
into you and that other one.
You got the wrong guy.
Well, then how did the exhaust
from your vehicle end up
in Dr. Holloway's tank?
What am I, one of those
guys?
I don't know.
Look, when I was younger,
the tit for tat was better than sex.
But these days
it just gives me indigestion.
So when Macklin invited me to
dinner last night, I accepted.
And when he said, "Let's
bury the hatchet," I said,
"Consider it squashed."
We broke bread.
His joint-- Carne's.
That used to mean something.
Well, it doesn't mean
that you're off the hook.
Willows, I'm telling you, cards up,
all I can give you is my word.
That used
to mean something, too.
Sorry to hear about your friend.
Good news is she came to you,
and now it's squashed.
But remember one thing, Mugs...
just because you say
it's squashed,
doesn't mean it's squashed.
Remember that, Catherine.
Evening, ladies.
Oh, this is my spot.
But don't go anywhere.
I'll need you.
Hey, maybe I should call Mr. Macklin.
Uh, on second thought, follow me.
Any surveillance on property?
Only inside.
And every car you valet
ends up where?
In the lot.
And what about the boss's cars,
or the boss's friends' cars?
We keep 'em right here.
Easy access. No waiting.
Can I go now, ladies?
No.
You were right, Catherine.
I think I got something here.
Hmm.
Uh, what is this?
I don't know.
I just park cars.
Smells like exhaust.
Are you sure that
you didn't see somebody
using this last night?
No.
Oh, Sara, I think we've got
ourselves an eyewitness.
Yeah.
You know the thing about ATM machines?
They take pictures every 15 seconds.
And you know what they say
about tiger sharks?
They can't close their mouths.
Really?
Neither can valet parkers.
And this one gave you up faster
than a natural Blackjack.
No comment.
- No comment.
- That's beautiful.
Beautiful.
Let me tell you a story.
How about you spare me
and not tell me a story?
Once upon a time,
there was this two-bit mogul
who made a cheap play for a shark.
He had buyer's remorse,
so he thought he'd pawn it
off on his veterinarian.
But then he had a better idea.
He thought,
"Maybe I'll make some money."
After all, it is Vegas.
"Maybe I'll make the money back
that I spent on the shark
and stick it to my enemy
at the same time."
Earnest Boozell.
So in order to make
this scam work,
he needs the help
of the veterinarian.
The veterinarian
has the key to Boozell's property
and a means to dump it.
How am I doing so far, Catherine?
Give him a couple more bites.
The aqua vet, he's the victim.
He's not very bright.
He was trying to remove
the VIN number from the fin...
the "fin" number...
because he thought that way,
we couldn't trace the shark back to you.
Because if there was
a missing shark on your property,
you'd be the first to know, right?
I don't know what kind
of financial arrangement
you had with the veterinarian,
but something happened,
and he had to go.
But you thought
you'd cover your tracks,
so you tampered
with his scuba gear.
And you thought you'd lay
that off on Boozell, as well.
Why'd you do that?
I thought it was "squashed"?
So now our story comes to an end.
You're going down for murder...
hook, line, and sinker.
Now you know the little secret.
Everyone thinks
that this is for the guests,
but it's really for me.
Spoken like a free man.
I was wrong about you.
I thought you were
just like your old man.
How's that?
Passionate, hardworking,
driven by money?
Two out of the three.
Which two?
Passionate, hardworking.
The truth is,
I'm driven by the money, too,
just like your father.
But you're not.
You're different than us.
Now I can see where
the greatness comes from.
Thank you... for the compliment.
Squashed?
I don't swim with sharks.
