Jack!
- Gotta go!
- Jack, don't go! Jack!
Sorry! Sorry!
Look out!
Shit!
Ssh...!
Open up!
I'm an American citizen seeking asylum!
Open up!
- May I see your passport, sir?
- If I had one, I wouldn't need asylum!
- Please, you've gotta let me in.
- Let me make a phone call.
Oh, man!
Pratt, I'm requesting asylum.
Mr Moore, this is not the place
to hold this discussion.
This used to be the Pakistani embassy.
Before that it was wired by the PRC boys.
Follow me.
This, however, is entirely bug-free.
Mr Moore...
- Peyton Reed.
- Jack.
The Ambassador has been
summoned by the Ministry.
This has the makings
of a full-scale incident.
A full-scale incident!
I'm sorry I didn't call for an appointment!
Do the two of you have any idea
of what I've been through?
No. I am not leaving here.
- No-one said you should leave.
- I'm not going.
- Of course not.
- You're in.
- But getting out is another story.
- You got other people out.
It took a year to get those physicists out.
And the Chinese Army
threatened to storm the embassy.
And that was just asylum.
You're charged with murder.
If this becomes a dick-measuring contest,
they'll never let you leave.
What?
What is it?
Your attorney is here.
- She wishes to see you.
- I advise no contact.
- Yuelin put up your guarantee.
- I thought the embassy put it up.
In China, bail is not about money.
It's reputation.
To have you released today,
Shen Yuelin put up her career, her future.
It was really quite unique.
Yuelin...
Your shoulder.
It's all right.
If I'd known what you did for me,
I wouldn't have left.
I'm glad you left.
- Glad?
- Yes.
Because I am not sure I could have saved
you from the decision of the court. And I...
I could not have lived with that.
Why did you risk your life for me
if you didn't believe me?
I always assumed the worst about you.
I have never questioned.
I have always accepted things.
It is the same as when I was a child.
Why?
I was blind. I was mute.
When you were a child...
It was during the Cultural Revolution,
wasn't it?
Yes.
What is it?
I went to school until they closed down,
and everything went mad.
I do not know if you could understand this,
Jack Moore.
Try me.
I...
I watched...
I watched my father be humiliated,
and I said nothing.
I watched my father be spat on.
I did nothing.
I even watched my classmates
pour black ink over his head,
one after another
and after another.
What did I do?
I hid my head in shame
while he was dragged away.
I never questioned.
I was blind.
I'm very sorry that
I did not believe your innocence.
But now I do.
I do.
Somebody alerted the press.
Let's get you out before your face
is on the cover of Time and Newsweek.
Wo men.
Wo men guanxi.
I thought you were through.
Evidence is missing here,
such as Hong Ling's locket.
Please do not make me go
to the Ministry ofJustice
and have them order you
to deliver this material.
The Ministry cannot find
something that doesn't exist.
I'm going to allow you to save face
by speaking English.
A certain general has a personal interest
in seeing some of this evidence returned.
Lf, by chance, an arresting officer
pocketed this evidence,
and it is not returned,
then even an attorney as good as I am
cannot ensure your wellbeing.
I suggest you search again. Anything you
might find can be brought to the court.
I need your counsel.
I want you to walk away from this.
I'm trying to access evidence
which would help prove your innocence.
Walk away now.
Why didn't you? The smart thing
would have been to stay at the embassy.
Yeah. And move past it.
Yes, I do that really well.
Why did you not?
Did you ever see little girls play soccer?
Little silly bundles of energy
just swarming all over each other and
tripping on each other, and
hair ribbons left on the ground
Your daughter.
Yeah, they were, um...
They were driving back from a game
when it happened... the accident.
And you were...?
Oh, I was in Tokyo. I was, um...
I was closing a deal. I could've finished it
the day before if I'd wanted to...
- You cannot blame yourself.
- No, I didn't. I didn't. I set it aside.
I just moved past it.
Built a wall around it.
I hired somebody to close up the house
in San Francisco. I got on a plane,
went somewhere to do something.
And I did it again and again
and I ended up here.
But what you leave behind
catches up with you.
Took me a long time to learn that.
If I had stayed in the embassy,
you would have been in danger.
I am not moving past this.
Jack...
You once offered to resign.
I want you to do that.
I want you to do that now.
My duty is to prove your innocence.
It is also...
It is also my wish.
Courage.
Yong qi.
Stop. What are you doing here?
I am the court-appointed lawyer.
This is my identification.
Why was I not notified?
You don't look like this picture.
Do not touch me, you pig!
Do not obstruct my investigation!
Wait!
Lfyou mess up the crime scene,
you will bear responsibility!
You better be careful!
Yuelin?
Why did you come here?
I am hero.
A record of calls made to and from
her cellphone, and a printout at home.
Peng! Where did you get this?
My friend Mai.
She say I am the world's greatest lover.
And now I am hero, too.
Peng, how did you talk your way
past the security man outside?
I did not have to. There was nobody there.
Come, Peng, you leave now. Go on, leave.
It doesn't brighten the situation that
your attorney got roughed up last night.
My attorney got what?
She was a trace roughed up.
A little bruised is all.
Bruised? What...? By who?
She didn't know who. She was in the hotel
where the victim expired.
She's just shook up.
- Stop.
- There's no stopping it now.
When you left sanctuary,
you overshot any point of return.
- What are you saying?
- You left the embassy out on a limb.
The embassy out on a limb?!
What about her?!
- You didn't make our job any easier.
- All right, all right! Meishi!
- What about her?
- I told you not to talk to her.
She's the one putting herself
on the line for me!
She's not our job.
She's out there all alone, isn't she?
Yes.
What happened?
- I have the records.
- Are you all right?
Whoever called Hong Ling that night
also spoke to an officer - Huan Minglu.
It doesn't matter. I don't want you hurt.
I have requested his presence
in court today. It does matter.
It will matter.
Why are you doing this?
You could be taken from your house,
from your grandmother.
You could be sent away, or put here,
or worse.
So why are you doing it?
I'm doing this because
I do not wish to be silent any more.
Supervising judges.
They are here to monitor.
It means today is the day.
Procurator General Yang,
next to General Hong.
And many of the Party elders.
This final session of our People's Court
hearing criminal case 4116
is now open.
Court is in session.
Advocate Shen Yuelin.
Presiding Chairman, I wish to summon
Huan Minglu to the witness stand.
He has not been introduced as a witness.
He may know what happened
to Hong Ling.
- This appears to be a diversionary tactic.
- This is pure manipulation of the facts.
Advocate Shen Yuelin, request denied.
I have evidence that Huan Minglu attacked
the accused and me in Dazhalan...
That is outside the scope
of this proceeding.
And attempted to murder the accused...
I must protest once more...
This evidence suggests
the accused is innocent.
Advocate Shen Yuelin, there is a
procedure for bringing unrelated charges.
When will that be? After my client
is sentenced? Or after he is executed?
Answer me, please.
Enough. We must call an end to testimony
only indirectly related.
Presiding Chairman...
Please sit down.
No, Presiding Chairman.
What did you say?
A man's life is at stake.
Not an American life. Not a Chinese life.
A man's life.
In such circumstances, what I am asking
is not an unreasonable request.
I will decide what is reasonable
and unreasonable.
Now sit down.
I said sit down!
The matter is decided. The court
is not interested in such witnesses.
I am.
- You are what?
- Interested in hearing. How about you?
I have already ruled.
Why not?
Presiding Chairman, the vote is 2 to 1.
With the approval of the court,
I summon Huan Minglu as a witness.
What's happening? What's going on?
I've lost the sound again!
It's okay.
The Procurator General wishes to see me.
- Why do they want you?
- Trust me. It will be okay.
I'll be right back.
Sit down.
Please sit down.
Be seated.
I declare the People's Beijing Intermediate
Court hearing criminal case 4116
once again open.
The defence advocate is not present.
- Nor is her legal aide.
- Then the witness should step down.
Presiding Chairman... Wait.
Ting, ting, ting, ting.
Yes, Accused Moore?
I believe I'm entitled
to question this witness.
Your right to question
has been previously established.
You may do so, briefly and to the point.
You do not want a cigarette?
I do not smoke, Procurator General.
Your father smoked.
I cannot sign it.
Huan Minglu, at approximately 2am
on the morning of the murder,
records show you received a call
from an unlisted cellphone.
- You remember who made that call?
- Irrelevant!
Proceed, Accused Moore.
Be direct, before even your friends, the
People's Assessors, lose their patience.
Do you remember who called you?
It was a wrong number.
Wrong number?
Then why did the call last five minutes?
Maybe it was someone talkative,
like the accused!
Presiding Chairman, can you instruct the
witness to wipe the smirk off his face?
The time has come to end this circus.
No... He is not guilty. I will not bargain.
I cannot sign it.
Then you'll be dismissed of your duties,
and disciplined.
Accused Moore, get to the point
before I dismiss the witness.
Have you ever served as a guard
for any government official?
Yes.
Have you ever met Minister Lin Shou?
Irrelevant.
Your behaviour is an
embarrassment to our People's Court.
No, Procurator General.
The shame is on those who abuse power
by ignoring the facts.
Do you know what you are speaking of?
A government official who's deliberately
obstructed this investigation
and who I believe is an accessory
to Hong Ling's murder.
What?
Have you ever met General Hong
or his daughter Hong Ling?
Irrelevant. I have already ruled against
this line of questioning.
Huan Minglu, as an officer in the PSB,
did you ever work in a prison such as...
Beyond the scope of this hearing.
Are you finished, Accused Moore?
No, I am not finished.
On April 1 Oth, did not you and
two accomplices rough me up?
- Beyond the scope of this hearing.
- Sustained.
On April 11th,
as I was sitting in a PSB car...
...did you not attack me and
my attorney?
No.
Irrelevant.
- I have not finished questioning.
- I have lost my patience.
Why will you not let this witness
answer my questions?
He just sits there, laughing at me!
Laughing and lying!
And where's my attorney now?
Was she causing too much trouble?
You are in contempt.
Why not just let her go and stay with me,
cos you've already measured my coffin!
I said you are in contempt!
You think I give a shit?!
What will do you?! Shoot me twice?!
Let my attorney go and take me!
I haven't any money, but I got some shoes!
Take my shoes to pay for the bullet!
Put a nice drop cloth down here!
Put a bullet right in the back of my head!
Do it right here! Bang!
Right in the back of my head!
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Do it right here, right now!
I don't wanna wait!
Your client was found
with my daughter's blood on his hands.
He was framed.
By whom?
By someone in power.
- Enough!
- No!
Let Advocate Shen Yuelin continue.
She is aware of the consequences to her
if the charge remains unprovable.
What is it about where these
telephone records lead
that everyone is afraid to face?
Make all the records available.
We have lived in silence too long
with courtrooms within courtrooms.
Why can we not conduct our affairs
in daylight?
Why can we not trust the people
to witness them?
Why can we not allow their voices
to be heard
rather than crushing them
into muteness?
I am willing to pay the price ifl am wrong.
Are you willing to pay the price
ifl am right?
We will proceed to final arguments
if Procurator Ma is prepared.
Presiding Chairman...
As Shen Yuelin's aide,
I wish to enter new evidence.
May I have permission?
For you.
Your lawyer is very persuasive.
Presiding Chairman,
I wish to call an additional witness.
This has no precedent.
I have already ruled.
Presiding Chairman,
I apologise to the court.
I request the court's permission
to call an additional witness.
I have already ruled.
The foreigner is mocking our court.
Presiding Chairman, I implore you...
I recognise I have tried the court's
patience. It will not happen again.
This witness is in a position to have
unique knowledge of the facts of this case
Not to call him would call into question
the proceedings of this case altogether.
Please, Presiding Chairman, please...
just one more witness.
Request denied.
The Procurator General has given
permission to call another witness.
I would like to call Minister...
Presiding Chairman,
I would like to call Lin Dan.
There is no foundation for this witness.
Lin Dan, please take the witness stand.
You made use of
the criminal code I gave you.
No, speak English. I know you can.
Congratulations on your appointment.
Principal Chinese programming partner
in HoffCo Telekomm's joint venture
with China.
Thank you.
- Wonderful opportunity.
- Yes.
Would it be accurate to say that my own
company, McAndrews Communications,
- was HoffCo's principal competitor?
- I suppose so.
You suppose so. Okay.
Is it also accurate to say that you had
no guarantee of an equivalent... payoff...
"Payoff" has a negative connotation.
Let me rephrase.
McAndrews did not offer you
an equivalent position.
It was not discussed. This has nothing
to do with Hong Ling's murder.
It has everything to do with it.
Was my indictment responsible
for McAndrews losing that deal?
Why does the court permit this?
You used her.
You used her and sacrificed her
to sabotage the deal your father
was completing with McAndrews
with whom he was friends.
Could've left you out in the cold.
These are not questions.
All right, but this is.
What was your relationship
with Hong Ling?
I had no relationship with Hong Ling.
None at all?
Would you like to reconsider
that statement?
I knew her. I knew of her family.
But there was no relationship.
No relationship.
How do you explain this?
Hong Ling's locket.
She wore it the night of the murder.
It just turned up.
Inside
is a picture of General Hong.
Inside of that
there is a charming photograph
of Hong Ling
and
you.
Accused Moore, let me see this evidence.
Please share that
with the People's Assessors.
They seem a little more interested now.
Also, Procurator Ma,
you're not smiling so much.
Why is there a photo of you and Hong Ling
inside her locket?
There was no relationship.
I knew her the way many men knew her.
- The way you knew her.
- But you did know her?
Answer me.
I knew her a long time ago.
I had not talked to her since...
I can't remember when.
Advocate Shen Yuelin,
enter the phone records into evidence.
On the night Hong Ling was killed,
three calls were made from this number
- and two received.
- Objection!
The first call was from Hong Ling
early that night.
Then, around 2am, a call was made
to a number registered to Huan Minglu.
You are out of order.
At 3.1 Oam, a second call was made
to a number registered to Hong Ling.
- What do these telephone numbers...
- Sshh!
At 5.41 am,
a call was received from Huan Minglu.
At 5.46am, a two-minute call was made
from this number to police headquarters.
- This is chaos!
- I will have you removed from the court.
- Lin Dan, do you own a cellphone?
- Yes or no?!
I do.
Can you tell us the number of that phone?
Mr Moore, I am not a secretary,
and I rarely call myself...
Is the number of your cellphone 517-857?
No, it is not.
You're sure?
Even though you rarely call yourself?
Yes, I am quite sure.
Who do you think has that number?
Is the telephone number yours,
Minister Lin Shou?
It is my number.
Don't, Father.
Don't what?
I am not afraid.
Why are you afraid?
You used your father's phone because
a minister's records can be withheld.
Hong Ling was supposed to set me up,
wasn't she?
Whatever it was, she changed her mind.
Then someone got in there
and drugged me with chloroform.
Isn't that what happened?
Was it...
Was it Huan Minglu?
Such speculation is out of order.
She resisted.
And she ended up dead.
He killed her, didn't he?
She got killed and I got set up!
I wasn't there. Ask him.
Da guar.
What did he just say?
Da guar? That's what Hong Ling said
that night. She said it over and over.
Da guar...
...wo men de...
He is saying da guar.
Hong Ling said
"Da guar wo men de guanxi wan la".
It means "Big shot" - an important
businessman - "Big shot, our deal is off".
Or maybe
"Our relationship is over."
Lin Dan, are you known to your friends
as Da Guar?
Are you known to your friends
as Da Guar Lin Dan?
The court is dismissed.
Presiding Chairman...
I lost sound!
I request that my client
be released immediately!
Da Guar...
- He said it again!
- Don't let them take you out of here!
- What's he saying?!
- Huan Minglu's the killer!
Take Huan Minglu into custody.
Did he confess?
He just said it was all Lin Dan's idea!
Lin Dan, I will see you privately.
Hong Ling was supposed to drug you,
then photograph you with a young girl.
Presiding Chairman, you must reconvene
the court and set my client free!
Arrest Lin Dan instead!
Did you hear what I said?! Arrest him!
He said he's sorry he caused you
so much trouble.
In keeping with the laws
of the People's Republic of China
the guilty parties have now
confessed to the crime
of conspiracy and murder,
namely, the death of Hong Ling.
The Court thanks the Party and
government leadership involved
for their diligence and professionalism.
The justice accorded will be swift,
as it will be fair and impartial.
Her tragic murder would not
have been solved had it not been...
Mr Moore!
We never had any doubt.
We were always there for you
behind the scenes.
You really believe this shit, don't you?
What did you say?
I said go to hell.
I have to take my grandmother
to the country.
You should see me. I love to be there.
I'll miss you.
There are so many beautiful
and remarkable things here.
Yes. I know.
When I was a child,
I would come to this park and play.
Do you know why the bamboo is here?
It is waiting for the wind to touch it.
It is filled with emotions.
Listen to the sounds
and you can feel them.
Come with me.
You know I cannot.
Change your mind. I know you can.
I've seen it.
For now, especially now, I must stay here.
I am needed to make it better.
You understand?
So
do we just say goodbye now?
Like nothing has happened?
No.
Something did happen.
My life has changed.
You have opened me up.
You are a part of my life now, Jack Moore.
And I will never be the same.
Neither will I.
Because I hope
I'm a part of your life now,
wherever we are.
Wherever we are.
Zaijian?
Zaijian.
You should go.
Yeah.
Remember, everything is different now.
Now you have someone
on the other side of the world
who is family.
You will always have a family.
Vous aurez toujours une famille.
