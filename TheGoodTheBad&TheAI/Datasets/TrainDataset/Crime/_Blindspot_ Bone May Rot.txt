She can't remember who she is,
where she came from, nothing...
before she crawled out
of that bag in Times Square.
-  Do you recognize her?
- No.
Then why is your name
tattooed on her back?
All of her tattoos
are brand-new.
It's a treasure map.
It's a Navy Seal tattoo.
If she was Navy, she'd
be in our database.
Not if she was Special Ops.
What is your problem with her?
Tell me the last time
a victim was invited
to join their own
FBI investigation.
That's an FBI case file.
It's heavily redacted.
You're listed
as the case officer.
If the girl has information
about Daylight on her body,
then we are
in very serious trouble.
When I was ten, my next-door
neighbor went missing.
You have the same eyes,
the same scar.
My name tattooed on your back.
You think I'm Taylor?
We had your DNA tested.
They're a match.
You are Taylor Shaw.
_
Hey, Juliette, how's it going?
Just out of the substrate,
they're ready to go.
Great, put it in the incubator
at 42 degrees.
-
- Walter?
Juliette...
Walter? Walter!
Walter, it's okay!
Walter, stay awake!
Stay with me, okay?
Walter!
Oh, my God.
_
"Sundered."
Eight-letter word
for "broken."
Right... right, right, right.
- What are you doing?
- Check it out.
I think I'm close to something.
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not supposed
to see these.
Why? What is this?
Anyway, why is this woman's
body covered in puzzles?
You can't just...
Th-This is my work.
This is a total
invasion of privacy.
You can't just...
I'm not gonna start going
through your folders.
I don't have folders.
That's not the point,
this is highly classified.
I shouldn't even have these
at home, I could get...
Have you figured out
the leaf one yet?
No...
Hmm.
Why, have you?
Can I?
Here.
Let me show you.
See, this one's a maple leaf.
No, I know, this is an oak.
Like, I've stared
at this for hours.
Classic puzzle misdirect.
It's not about the leaves.
It's about where they intersect.
Oh, my God. Here, look at...
give me this.
Look what happens
if we rotate it.
Oh, right.
Well, now that we
know your identity,
we can begin to answer
some of these questions.
If I'm Taylor Shaw...
does this mean I have a family?
Are there people looking for me?
You were raised by a single mom.
Emma Shaw.
Does she know that I'm alive?
She passed away.
I'm sorry.
What was she like?
She was a great mom.
And she worked very hard
to give you everything.
You were her whole world.
Do I have sisters or brothers?
No, no.
You spent a lot of time
with me and my sister.
You were basically
part of our family.
So whoever put
your name on my back
must have known that we had
a connection as kids.
But... But that
still doesn't answer
what happened to me
and how I got here.
No, uh, but it is a start.
It's the strongest lead
that we have.
That's right.
I mean, your identity,
your mother's name,
where you grew up.
These are all things that can
trigger powerful memories.
And that's our time.
Agent Weller, moving forward,
I'd encourage you
to share anything
that you can remember
about Taylor.
Any small detail could help.
Zapata!
This the new boyfriend?
It's not what you think.
Ah, no judgments.
I'm just glad to see you
with a skinny dude for once.
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on, your usual types
are mixed between
gladiator and Viking.
I do not have a type.
I catch bad guys
for a living, all right?
The last two dudes
you dated scared
Then you scare easily,
'cause they were a loan
officer and a soccer coach.
- Sure they were.
-
And if you would
stop paying attention
to the way people look,
then maybe you would
get out of that rut you're in.
Rut?
Who's in a rut?
Oh, I see you...
wiping that phone.
It's a numbers game.
Last of the romantics.
All right, check this out.
So see her tattoo here?
The two leaves?
It's an oak and a maple leaf.
What's the significance?
That's what
I couldn't figure out until
I realized I was focusing
on the wrong thing.
So see how the two leaves
have a dark, shaded section
where they intersect?
It's where they overlap
that matters.
Well, looks
a little like a bird.
Exactly.
So I knew I'd seen
this image before,
and I ran a search
and found it's part of a logo.
Centers for Disease Control.
So what has that
got to do with leaves?
The CDC's headquarters are
on the northeast corner of...
...Oak and Maple.
Nice work.
Thank you.
I just kind of, you know,
came up with it this
morning when we were...
Um... I was...
I was alone,
and I was just eating a...
a breakfast.
Okay... does this tattoo
happen to mention
what we're looking for?
No.
The CDC is a huge organization.
Yeah.
Let's get started.
I'll let them
know you're coming.
Thanks.
Look, we have no idea what
we're getting ourselves into.
You sure you want
to bring her today?
We've been through this.
She might see
something that we don't.
All right, honestly,
the idea of having her
armed and out in the field
makes me nervous.
She can handle herself.
Target practice is one thing,
but think about what
she's going through.
How's she supposed to focus?
I don't want to keep having
this conversation with you.
She's coming with us.
Hello.
Rebecca Fine.
I'm Deputy Director
of Epidemiology.
Kurt Weller, FBI.
Pleasure.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Frank Surrey, Military Liaison
and Principal Director.
Edgar Reade.
I understand you all need to
inspect our facility...
should we be concerned?
No. We're working
on a classified case.
Unfortunately, I can't
say much more than that,
but we do appreciate
your cooperation.
Great, just in time.
This is Juliette Chang,
my lab assistant.
Nice to meet you.
Juliette will take you
through security,
give you a tour.
Let us know if you
need anything else.
So anyone entering
the secure part of our lab
needs to go through
a decontamination process.
It seems like it should be
the other way around.
-
-
She's too smart for you.
I'll be turning on
an ultraviolet light
that will destroy any
potentially harmful contaminants
that may be on your bodies.
After we're done here, I'll
escort you to the vacuum room.
If everyone's ready, I'll go
ahead and start the process.
That's the reason why
we bring her in the field.

Ultraviolet tattoos
aren't especially rare,
but this application was genius.
Why haven't we seen this before?
in their decontamination process
essentially cooked
the invisible ink like a...
like a sunburn, making it
visible under these conditions
and these conditions only.
We never would have
seen this in a lab.
So whoever tattooed them
knew that she'd have to be
at the CDC for them
to become visible?
That's right.
It's a site-specific tattoo.
So what do these numbers mean?
It's got to have something
to do with the CDC.
Juliette, do these
mean anything to you?
Those numbers follow
the exact sequence
we use to categorize
our lab specimens.
Which specimens?
Let me check.
This is weird.
I think you need
to talk to my boss.
Each of these numbers
corresponds
with a sample vial
of an infectious disease.
SARS, MERS...
typhoid fever, Ebola.
Wait, those vials are kept here?
None of those diseases
have any cure.
Shouldn't they be kept in
a biohazard Level 4 facility?
We have an undisclosed
BHL4 lab at this facility.
Knowledge of the lab
is strictly need-to-know.
Most of our own employees
aren't even aware of it.
So other than the fact that
these are dangerous diseases,
what else do they
have in common?
I mean, there's got to be
a reason they were singled out.
I wish I could tell you.
Actually, I think
I have something.
It looks like Walter
was the last person to
access all of the vials.
- Walter?
- Walter Tunnel.
He was our former director.
Where can we find him?
Unfortunately, Walter died
in an accident two years ago.
He was infected with a...
a rare form of botulism.
How'd he get infected?
There was a tear
in his safety suit.
It never should've happened.
It's taken us a long time
to get over the loss.
He was a wonderful man.
We're gonna need
to see those vials.
Of course.
Juliette, take them
down to BHL4.
I'll, uh, call in the clearance.
Reade, Zapata, find out
everything you can about
Walter's accident
and his connection to the vials.
Hey, Juliette.
Did you know Walter personally?
Yeah, I knew him really well.
I took his epidemiology class
at Columbia, and then
I interned for him.
I was there when he died.
It was...
It was a real shock.
He was always so careful.
Good to go?
Yeah, we're all set.
Now, the process for
entering a BHL4 lab
is a bit more complicated.
Let's get suited up and I'll
walk you guys through it.
Good.
-
- Hey. Sorry.
Just wanted to check in
on the Guerrero file,
see where we're at.
I'm handling it.
Right... it's just,
Jane's tattoo is directly
related to this file,
and... and this could be
the key to everything.
If you could get it
unredacted...
I can't do that.
Okay...
Is...
Is there a... a reason
that you don't want me
looking into this case?
We still have agents in
the field who could be affected.
It's too dangerous
to start poking around.
I understand that.
But if you could just
give me some context...
When I say it's too dangerous,
it's too dangerous.
- I just... we're so...
- Tell me something.
That CDC tattoo
you solved today,
"on your own"...
how'd you really crack it?
Maybe you should
get back to work.
Yes, ma'am.
Follow me.
This is our BHL4 lab.
All the specimens are kept
in a negative 70-degree freezer.
Shut the door
behind you, please.
Yes, ma'am.
That's strange.
It should be right here.
Maybe it got mislabeled.
Check the next number.
_
It's not there, either.
_
So far, all the vials
from the tattoos are missing.
How is this possible?
What is that?
Did we set something off?
No, it wasn't us.
There must have been a breach.
We're in lockdown.
A breach?
Wh-What does that mean?
Are... are we safe
in here?
It could be
security-related
or a compromise
in one of the labs.
I just don't know.
When was the last time
this happened?
It was when Walter died.
He was the last person
to access the missing vials.
- I need to regroup with my team.
- No, I'm sorry.
That's just not
gonna be possible.
We have to stay here until
the lockdown is lifted.
For how long?
How long?!
_
Timing of this seem
a little weird to you?
Very.
Think Jane and Weller are okay?
Something might have
happened with those vials.
They're wearing HAZMAT suits.
Probably the safest ones
in here.
We should be in there with them.
I'm glad we're not.
You really wanna be stuck in
a room with Weller right now?
No window, no way out?
That is a control freak's
worst nightmare.
Here, why...
Why don't you sit?
This feels deliberate.
Walter accesses those vials
and then dies in an accident.
As soon as we find out they're
gone, we get locked in here.
I... I agree, it's too
big of a coincidence,
but what can we do?
I mean, Juliette said
it's gonna be a while.
Kurt.
Sit, please.
You're making me nervous.
Here.
Will you tell me
about that night?
The night I went missing.
You... You said
you were there.
I was the only one there.
When your mom worked nights...
she'd ask me
to take care of you.
And you'd already gone to bed.
I went in to check on you.
And you were gone.
Then what happened?
I searched for you.
I checked the whole house.
Did someone break in?
There were no signs
of forced entry.
No doors were open.
No windows were open.
You just vanished.
Were there any suspects?
Only one.
My father.
There was never
any physical evidence.
But he lied about his alibi.
People thought that he was...
he was too close.
He was close to...
He denied it.
He still does.
Lockdown has been lifted.
I told Frank about
the missing vials.
He's on his way down.
The lockdown?
What happened?
According to security,
it was a false alarm.
But it's strange.
Apparently, Rebecca is
the one who initiated it.
We need to talk to Rebecca.
She's not here.
Where is she?
I'm sorry, who are you?
When did she leave?
Right before the lockdown.
She went to run an errand.
What is this about?
Y-You can't go in there.
Uh, you can't just do that!
How'd she initiate
a lockdown
if she's not even
in the building?
It looks like she
accessed this computer
remotely from her laptop
after she left.
You think she did this
to trap us in here?
Yeah.
Question is why.
That's impossible.
They must have been misplaced.
No, they're missing.
Okay, we need to alert
security right now,
have them review video footage,
pass codes,
everything they have.
Who had access to the vials?
Only two people in the CDC
can give clearance
to get into that freezer...
myself and Rebecca.
We're gonna need
to talk to her now.
She's in the wind.
She initiated
a lockdown remotely.
Feels like she wanted
to tie us up.
Remotely from where?
Patterson tracked down
Rebecca's IP address.
She sent the lockdown commands
from a brownstone in Brooklyn.
Let's move.
Patterson.
Send a team to that
address in Brooklyn.
Find out if Rebecca's there.
So it turns out Rebecca
has been running
a secret lab in Brooklyn.
No sign of the missing vials,
but she had her own
mini CDC in there.
Mass spec machines,
x-ray crystallography lab,
you name it.
Any idea what she's up to?
Nothing good, but
according to CDC records,
one of the missing vials
contains a rare strain
of viral hemorrhagic fever.
Essentially the deadlier cousin
of Ebola with no known cure.
What would happen if that was
released into the population?
An outbreak like
we've never seen.
Possibly millions of casualties.
Any leads on Rebecca?
She's gone dark.
Her phone's not operational
and she hasn't logged on
to her computer
since the lockdown.
That's not very promising.
So we're gonna find her
and find out
what she's planning
to do with those vials.
This map shows the origins
of disease outbreaks
from the past five years.
Several of them correspond
with the disease specimens
in the missing vials.
Ebola. SARS.
MERS. Typhoid fever.
They were contained eventually,
but not before tens
of thousands of people died.
We've been tracking
Rebecca's movements
for the past few years.
Get this:
the last nine major epidemics
occurred in cities
that she's traveled to
or near just before
the outbreaks.
So you're saying
that she started them?
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's actually
a pretty big coincidence
if she didn't.
Rebecca is singlehandedly
responsible
for all of those deaths?
Why would she do this?
I don't know.
But there are ten disease
strains missing
and it looks like
she used nine of them.
She has one left.
The deadliest one.
Why hasn't she used it yet?
Uh, I think I might know.
We just seized these
aerosol cans from her lab.
She was in the process
of weaponizing the virus.
So we just accelerated
her timeline.
She must have realized
it was now or never.
Grabbed one of the prototypes.
Hey, looks like
Rebecca's husband just used
his credit card at
a gas station in Cold Spring.
You think they're together?
He's the last person she called
before she destroyed her phone.
I'm calling state police.
I don't understand.
How did your mom get
into a car accident?
I mean, whose car
was she driving?
I don't know.
We'll be there soon.
I wasn't even speeding.
Another one?
This is ridiculous.
What'd I do?
Just pull over.
Turn off the ignition,
exit the vehicle...
What the hell is going on?
Look, I love you.
Please understand.
I am trying to save the world.
What are you talking about?
I'm so sorry.
But this will be faster.
Rebecca, what are you...
-
- Uhh!
Thank you.
Her mother lives upstate.
I think that's where
she might have been heading.
She must have known once
we saw the vials were missing
we'd be onto her.
We just got
the crime scene photos.
The state police
checked the car.
No sign of the missing vial,
but they did find
a parking receipt
from the Manhattan
Cruise Terminal
from about three hours ago.
Why would she stop
at the pier first?
If she was planning to infect
as many people as possible,
the terminal would be ideal.
Thousands of people
getting off cruise ships
and getting on the planes
to head home.
Perfect way to spread
the virus around the world.
If that was her plan,
she wouldn't have
to hide the device.
She could put it
somewhere out in the open.
What is this?
Can you zoom in on her watch?
Set on a timer.
About two hours to go.
When was that photo taken?
So we got until 4:00 p.m.
to find that delivery device.
She wasn't just running from us.
She was trying to get
out of the hot zone.
I'll dial in TSA and NYPD
to order an immediate evacuation
and I'll get our biohazard team
to start suiting up.
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not gonna
make it in time.
We gotta stop this now.
If that device goes off,
a lot of people are gonna die.
Thank you.
You blame yourself, don't you?
For what?
The night I went missing.
You think it was your fault.
You know, ever since you
told me I'm Taylor, I've...
been focusing on what
that means for me, but...
you've been living
with this for 25 years.
Have you talked
to your dad about me?
My dad and I...
It's not that simple.
I can't talk about it
right now, Jane.
I don't wanna...
talk about it.
All right.
Here we go.
Looks like the evac's
already underway.
Excuse me.
Move!
What are we looking for?
Anything that looks
out of place.
In a crowded terminal
during an evacuation?
Should be easy.
Come on, folks,
keep it moving.
Excuse me, coming through.
Excuse me.
All right.
Reade, Zapata,
go check the security footage
from a few hours ago.
Jane and I will
search the floor.
Excuse me, coming through,
excuse me.
Jane.
The terminals are
being swept by NYPD.
TSA is securing the ships
and the baggage areas.
So far, I haven't
seen anything unusual.
It's a needle in a haystack.
Rebecca didn't
have a lot of time.
What?
What is it?
See that?
All these bags are linked
with that security chain,
except for that one.
That's not right.
Zapata... you in
the control room?
I'm in front of
the check-in desk.
Review the footage from my
position a couple hours back.
- I think we've got something.
- Pull up the check-in desk.
Can you take it
back a few hours?
There she is.
Rewind it.
We got her.
- Now what?
- We contain it.
How?
Where's the HAZMAT team?
They should be here by now.
The evacuation caused
a massive traffic jam.
They're having trouble
getting through.
We're running out of time.
How are we gonna
do this on our own?
Patterson?
Okay, okay.
Uh, uh...
We can do this.
I can walk you through it.
Uh, first, we're
gonna need to prevent
as much collateral damage
as possible.
Every door and window needs
to be shut in the terminal,
and the main HVAC system
- needs to be turned off.
- On it.
Next, we're gonna
need to "MacGyver"
some sort of containment tent
around the bag
before it goes off.
We're on it.
Move it this way.
Reade!
Give me a hand.
Get the broom.
Okay...
One more, one more.
The key is to
make it airtight.
You just need it to hold
until HAZMAT gets there.
Reade.
Okay.
That's it.
It's 4:00.
Nothing happened.
Maybe we got the wrong bag.
What's wrong?
I don't think.
Why, what have you heard?
You never call me at work.
About the tattoo.
It's been killing me.
- No.
-
Damn it!
I thought for sure
we cracked that thing.
No, no, no, no, no,
we were right, but...
Yes, I knew it.
Was it a big deal?
It's a big deal, isn't it?
You can't tell me.
That's okay.
It had that feel to it, though.
Yes, it's...
it's a very big deal,
but that's not the point.
Hey, what'd the bird mean?
Was it a cipher or something?
It was a cipher, wasn't it?
No, it was a logo.
No, David!
We have to stop.
You can't help me with this stuff.
These tattoos are classified.
I mean, you shouldn't
even be looking at them.
Hey, did we solve it
or didn't we?
Yeah, we did, but...
And did it help or didn't it?
It did, but...
Then what's the problem?
Look, if I can help you crack
some of these faster,
isn't that a good thing?
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.
Uh, I gotta go.
Okay.
Hey, I have a...
like, a weird craving
for that corn dog place
across from Barcade.
Do you want to meet me
there tonight?
Uh, yeah, fine, whatever.
Just... just stop
calling me at work.
Hey, guys.
Come on in.
We need to do a basic evaluation
and get some blood from
you guys before we let you go.
Wonderful.
Where's, uh,
Special Agent Weller?
He didn't want to leave
the makeshift containment
tent unattended,
just in case.
We should have stayed with him.
It's over.
He's fine.
Do you have a radio
for Agent Weller?
Agent Weller, this is
Frank Surrey from the CDC.
I'm here to relieve you.
I need you to report
I'll stay,
help you seal the area.
Agent Weller, my team
should be here any minute.
Every second you're there, you
increase your risk of exposure.
That's why you're gonna
bring me a HAZMAT suit, Doctor.
I'm on my way.
Did you know her well?
I thought I did.
Went to school together.
Co-authored
several papers.
I was the one who brought her
into the fold at the CDC.
Well, this is very not good.
It's hard not to feel
responsible for this
in some way.
You can't think like that, Doc.
Hey, Weller,
are you still on VOX?
Uh... yeah.
What's up?
Don't let Dr. Surrey
near the device.
Why is that?
I-I-I've been
cross-referencing
every CDC employee's travel
to see if there was any overlap
with the outbreaks,
and I just got an alert that
Frank purchased
a plane ticket an hour ago
with short layovers
all around the world.
EDT?
The ticket was bought today.
to infect himself
and fly around the world
and spread the disease.
He's probably already ripped
his safety suit... and yours.
Doc, stop.
Step away, Doc.
- But I...
- Don't!
It's over.
Rebecca and I spent our
entire lives studying viruses.
Do you know what the greatest
threat to mankind is?
Modern medicine.
Stop!
Don't move!
We create all these vaccines,
antibiotics...
cures for diseases
that should never be cured.
This planet was not designed
to support 8 billion people.
You're a doctor.
You work for the CDC.
Your job is to save lives.
No, my job is to save
the human race.
If we do nothing,
our destruction is guaranteed.
That is insane.
No...
It's already
spiraling out of control.
In your lifetime, we're
gonna see famine, drought,
poverty,
on an unimaginable scale.
Somebody's got to have
the courage
to do what has to be done
to save the human species.
Walter found out, didn't he?
And that's why you killed him.
All these diseases
that we're trying
so desperately
to find a cure for
are actually
the last-ditch effort
of a dying planet
trying to save itself,
trying to wipe out
the thing that is actually
destroying it: us.
Don't!
- Uhh!
- Ohh!
The CDC is so solid.
How did Frank and Rebecca
have these radical views
and go undetected?
They're gifted scientists.
Top of their field.
The CDC had no reason to suspect
that they'd gone rogue.
They almost got away
with it, though.
They're gonna be fine.
We all are.
Hope so.
First the DOD, then the CDC.
Whoever made these tattoos had
some pretty serious access.
- Definitely.
- Why would they do this to her?
Why kidnap a woman,
wipe her memory,
then tattoo her entire body
with puzzles for us to solve?
Makes her pretty hard to ignore.
Okay.
Hold that.
And I will be back in a minute.
You just wait here for me, okay?
Hey, good work today.
Thank you.
Look, I know you think
I'm the bad guy
because I didn't
welcome you with open arms.
You think I'm a liability.
I don't know what more
I can do to...
I'm not worried about you.
All of us depend on Weller.
He's got better judgment
than anyone I've worked with
my whole career.
He's made
split-second decisions
that have saved our lives
more times than I can count.
- I don't understand...
- When he's around you,
the guy I lean on,
the guy I know... isn't there.
And that scares
the hell out of me.
There's nothing
I can do about that.
I know.
That's the problem.
What are you doing in here?
I was thinking about our
conversation the other night,
regarding your mystery girl.
This laissez-faire
approach of yours
isn't really doing it for me.
Tom...
I want to talk to her.
That's not possible.
possible.
I mean, you of all people
should know that.
Come on, I get
in a room with Jane,
we have a nice little chat,
it'll be great.
I promise not to bite.
I told you I was
managing the situation,
so give me the time to do that.
Time is the last thing
that we have.
See, if your girl knows about
Daylight, then who else does?
And what do they know about us?
What, you think
it's a coincidence
that she was gift-wrapped
and delivered to your team?
See, I don't like the proximity,
and I don't like
the question marks.
Her mind was wiped.
She's just a vessel for
this information, that's all.
What are you basing that on?
What, a lie detector test
and some psych evals?
Just let me talk to her.
I'm not handing her over to you
so you can throw her
in some cell and do
whatever it is the CIA does
to find things out.
This doesn't have to be
a straight favor.
What do you need from me?
Let's make a deal here.
I need for you
to get out of my office.
So be it.
Just remember this later...
when everything's falling apart
and you're asking yourself why,
that I came to you first
and tried to play nice.
'Cause the rest is on you.
_
You were very brave today.
Stupid... but brave.
I think there was a compliment
in there somewhere.
Yeah.
I'm, um, I'm...
I'm sorry if,
earlier, in the car...
I recognize where
that photo was taken.
We had a creek
at the back of our house.
Just out there.
Used to go fishing there
with my dad.
We didn't... we didn't
catch much, but, uh...
I loved being out there.
My sister,
she was always inside,
playing with her dolls,
but, uh...
but you were a tomboy.
Anytime I was outside,
you'd run out of your house
and try to tag along.
We...
We had this little...
wooden fort.
I haven't thought about
that for a long time.
Sorry.
Weller, can I steal you
for a second?
Okay.
Well...
Yeah.
It's really nice...
to have you back.
_
That's cold, Tash.
Screening my calls all day.
I was gonna hit you up
after I got out of the subway.
What are you doing following me?
If you picked up
your phone, you know,
I wouldn't have
to chase you down.
I'll pay you as soon as I can.
Jets lost today.
That makes it 40 Gs now.
Let's go again.
Double or nothing.
No.
That's how you got in this hole.
I want my money.
I'll get it to you.
You know I'm good for it.
Three days.
All right, what am I looking at?
Molecules of coltan,
which is short
for columbite tantalite.
My favorite of all
the tantalites.
They're trace isotopic elements
I found in Jane's tooth.
You pulled one of Jane's teeth?
Well, I-I-I took the one
that was knocked out in
the fight at the safe house.
Right.
I mean, it was
too good to resist.
The human tooth is...
is a goldmine
of genetic information.
Besides, it's not like
she can put it back in.
Yeah, what does this mean?
These elements would
only be in Jane's enamel
if she was from
Sub-Saharan Africa.
Maybe she was taken there
after she got kidnapped.
Here's the thing.
Isotopes can be aged.
Kind of like carbon dating.
The markers in her teeth are
from when she was an infant.
So what are you saying?
She was born in Africa.
No. She was born
in Pennsylvania.
I was there the day
they brought her home.
- I'm sorry.
- N-No.
But that's not
what the tooth says.
Your DNA tests confirmed
that she's Taylor Shaw.
So what are you saying?
That's not true?
All I know is the DNA results
directly contradict
the isotope test.
Is she Taylor Shaw or not?
Both tests are conclusive,
but both can't be true.
I don't know who she is.
