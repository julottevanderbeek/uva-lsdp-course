Two-nine to Dispatch,
ten-double-zero.
Ten-double-zero,
requesting backup.
Crossover D.
I didn't see anything, I swear.
I never saw your faces.
Take off,
and nothing will happen.
Come on, let's go.
Please!
I'm out of here!
It's kind of early
for you, Deeks.
Well, you can't be too careful.
Mercury's in retrograde.
Meaning?
A few times a year,
the planet Mercury
appears to be traveling
backwards through the Zodiac.
It causes all of our plans
to go awry.
Seriously?
I think you're in retrograde.
Morning.
You're late.
Mercury.
We were supposed to shoot hoops.
I'm sorry, I had a flat tire.
Mercury.
You couldn't call?
My cell phone battery died.
:
Mercury.
Actually, it's lithium ion.
Apparently, we have a problem
with Mercury over here.
What, the messenger
of the gods?
The, uh,
guy with the winged sandals?
Never liked him.
Always in a hurry.
DEEKS:
Mock, mock, mock.
But when Mercury is
in retrograde
and travelling backwards,
everything goes catawampus,
so stay flexible
and allow for extra travel time.
Morning.
Hey, Kensi...
Yeah.
What happens when Mercury
is in retrograde?
Deeks gets retro-annoying.
Wow.
Oh, come on.
Problems happen all the time,
and three times a year,
we have to blame it on Mercury?
Ridiculous.
Sounds like an urban myth.
It's more like a superstition.
Don't do it;
don't taunt Mercury.
Or what, the guy in
the chariot's gonna stop
pulling the sun
around the Earth?
Can't you hear
the whistle blowing?
I wish I couldn't.
Oh, hold on...
I should call my mom.
Why? What's going on?
Well, I stepped on a crack
this morning,
so she's probably
in the O.R. by now.
God...
ERIC:
Brian Cheng, security guard
for the Fillmore
and Western Railway.
Now, that had to hurt.
Anything on the bad guys?
Wearing masks, usually avoiding
security cameras.
These guys knew
what they were doing.
He's not gonna do that,
is he?
NELL:
Afraid so.
Oh, man.
Two minutes earlier...
Cheng caught them trespassing.
KENSI: Taking photos
and measurements.
Casing the joint.
Dead men tell no tales.
Sheriff's Department's on this?
Oh, yeah, but Cheng's walkie
was open during the attack.
And as he was thrown
under the train...
MAN:
Allahu Akbar.
HETTY:
There are rumors
of Al Qaeda targeting
rail lines in Europe.
Train terrorism?
A soft target with the potential
for mass casualties.
We need to be certain
that this does not come to pass.
Check all
fundamentalist chatter.
Sam?
Rail yard or security guard?
Uh, trains, I actually
have an affinity for...
Rail yard.
...trains.
This may be personal.
You guys look into the guard.
Got it.
HETTY:
Careful out there.
Mercury is in retrograde.
See?
Hetty knows about...
Oh, you're messing.
Damn it.
Hey.
Morning!
Agent Callen.
Agent Hanna, NCIS.
Jeremy Pernell,
Railway Public Relations.
Did the deceased have
a military connection?
That's why we're here.
Detective Garcia's in charge.
You had a supervisor
on duty last night?
He's home sleeping.
Does he have a name?
Well, I'd have to clear that
with management.
This is a federal
criminal investigation.
It'd be in your best interest
to cooperate.
Absolutely,
it's just this whole thing
has potential to blow up
into some bad press,
and the FRA is coming down
from Sacramento, so...
The FRA?
Federal Railroad Administration,
our regulatory body.
First we have
to follow protocol,
go through their channels
for their investigation,
then Monday, tomorrow,
maybe the next day,
you guys can sit down
and do your interviews.
With our legal counsel present,
of course.
Jeremy...
are you trying
to obstruct justice?
Isn't that a felony?
Up to 20 years.
No, no, no, no.
I am just doing my job.
We'll have a little walk
around the yard,
if that's all right with you.
Be my guest.
Whatever you guys need.
He's either
a big knucklehead,
or they've got
something to hide.
Either way,
it sounds like the FRA holds
the keys to the castle.
Let's put Kensi
and Deeks on it.
There were two of them.
The first guy ran off that way.
SAM: Could've hopped
the fence.
That's what I'm thinking.
Kind of nice to ride
the rails, huh?
I don't share
your hobo esthetic.
Talking about
working on a train.
Bringing people what they need,
being connected to history...
The rolling stone
gathers no moss.
That's right;
you got to keep moving.
Otherwise you'll have moss
growing all over you,
like a fungus.
That's not what
the proverb means.
It's exactly what it means.
No, it isn't. Moss is good.
Moss is a disease.
When you keep moving,
you're barren.
You sleep on couches.
When you're sturdy and still...
you put down roots.
Moss has no roots.
You peel it away
like a rotten banana.
I think your brain's a rotten banana.
Mm-hmm.
What is it?
It's something with a dial.
"Rome"?
It's a long way from Italy.
ERIC: The instrument you found
is a trainman's gauge.
It's used to measure pressure
in the air brake system.
What about Rome?
I'm sending you a photo
of Mitchell Rome.
He's a recently fired brakeman
with Fillmore and Western.
Why was he let go?
He was about
to be promoted to engineer.
Lost his job after
testing positive for marijuana
and causing a collision
in the yard.
NELL:
No one was hurt,
damage was minor,
but it cost him his career.
Might leave you with some bitter
feelings toward your employer.
Any extremist connections?
Not him,
but at the same address
is one Gil Bellamy,
unemployed demolitions expert.
Bellamy?
That's not your
typical Arabic name.
NELL:
He's been a commenter
on several
bomb-building Web sites,
including one called
"Jihadist Raiders Front""
His knowledge of munitions
and Rome's knowledge
of trains...
This could end badly.
KENSI:
Rome's on the second floor.
Oh!
What? Something from ops?
My horoscope.
You have a horoscope app?
You wouldn't understand;
you're a Leo.
That's right, lion,
king of the jungle.
Full of fire and aggression,
has to be right,
even when she isn't.
Actually, especially
when she isn't.
And what does that make you?
I'm a Capricorn.
What is that,
the unicorn's inbred cousin?
The ram.
Really?
You're a goat?
No, no, that's a completely
different animal.
I'm the ram.
I see, so scruffy,
annoying bleat.
Uh, stable, steady,
loyal, connected
with the earth.
Also, Leos drive
Capricorns crazy.
Yes, well, apparently,
vice versa.
Slow down.
You slow down, goat boy.
No, no, no, 210.
DEEKS:
Hey, uh, sir?
Hey, did you sign for
a package earlier?
No...
No! Federal agents!
Federal agents!
What's the rush?
I thought you were the guys
lived up there.
What part of "federal agents"
did you not understand?
Hey, I don't hear so good.
Yeah, what do you need this for?
A little
Smith & Wesson revolver?
What's up, old school?
I got a concealed weapons
carry permit
in my wallet.
Name's Anthony Trager.
private investigator.
He's telling the truth.
This guy's a private eye.
A little help?
Gumshoe,
a shamus,
a bird dog.
What's wrong with this guy?
He's in retrograde.
P.I.'s aren't supposed
to break into apartments.
I knocked; the door was open.
Retired LAPD? You a cop?
I'm a cop.
Lawman,
blue knight, hot fuzz. open.
What is he, like,
Rain Man or something?
I wish; at least he could count.
So what are you guys?
FBI? Homeland Security?
NCIS.
I guess we're both interested
in Mitchell Rome.
Mm-hmm.
How's that, Dragnet?
I was hired
by Fillmore and Western.
He's been babbling
about dragging them into court
for wrongful termination
of employment.
I was looking
for any skeletons
in his closet that
might torpedo his case.
Easiest gig I ever had.
They guy's a real pothead.
Stoner, dope fiend,
smoke monkey.
You know what I'm talking about.
Midnight toker, see you later.
What the...?
DEEKS:
Wow.
Okay, so manuals,
routes, schematics.
He is either
a really dedicated employee...
Or a crazy and obsessive killer.
Oh, man, is that
what I think it is?
What?
Oh, my Godit is.
It's an Airfix HO-scale
Excuse me?
They don't even
make these anymore.
And you know
this because...
Because I asked Santa
for it every single year,
and all I got was stupid Thomas.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Thomas is kind,
Thomas is dependable,
Thomas is not stupid.
Thomas has a face, all right?
Trains shouldn't have a face,
and they shouldn't talk.
We should all be so lucky.
Um, you wouldn't
happen to have
the bomb squad on speed dial,
would you?
What?
Looks like we got several bricks
of plastic explosives,
assorted blasting
caps and timers.
Highlighted rail maps
through Pasadena,
Long Beach and downtown L.A.
I'm gonna call it in.
These guys are getting
ready to strike.
I think I can, I think I can.
Kaboom.
ERIC: Homeland Security's
been briefed and all freight
and passenger security personnel
are on high alert.
And absolutely nothing
suspicious on Cheng,
the dead security guard.
And what about Gil Bellamy?
Rome took him in as a roommate
after he got fired,
probably to help pay the rent.
but I'm still digging through
his electronic footprint.
You sure this is
the right hospital?
Rome's mother was
off duty at 8:00.
Followed by two hours
of administrative meetings.
Here we go.
Jillian Rome?
Federal agents. Can we ask you
a couple questions?
I worked a night shift,
and I got a train to catch.
A train?
Yeah, I commute
from Diamond Bar.
Get a nap in both ways
and don't have to deal
with the traffic.
If this is about a patient,
maybe you could contact
the appropriate...?
We'd like to ask you
about your son.
You seen him lately?
No, um...
I... you know,
be-before he lost his job,
I used to talk to him
every day on the phone,
but now I'm lucky
if I get a text.
He's a suspect in a crime
at Fillmore and Western.
Mitch is not a criminal.
Do you know his roommate?
What roommate?
Look, m-my son is
a straight arrow.
I-I worked nights so I could be
with him every day after school.
He knows right from wrong.
According
to his former employer,
he had a marijuana problem.
No, no, that whole thing
was a mistake.
I mean, he doesn't even drink.
Mitch has loved trains
since he was in diapers.
He used to beg me to ride
in to work on the train.
It was his dream to
become an engineer.
There's absolutely no way
that he would throw
that all away.
There isn't.
If your son is innocent,
he may need protection
We need your help.
We'd like your permission
to access your cell phone
in case he calls.
Okay.
If you see him,
let us know?
I will.
Thank you.
That's a good mom.
Sounds like a good kid.
Yeah.
They said the same
thing about you.
I see the FRA has arrived.
Yes, we have.
Karen Bibb.
Yolanda Campbell,
operations manager.
Nice to meet you.
Matthew Dunkler.
Matthew doesn't like
to shake hands.
Germs.
I wasn't expecting you
until this afternoon.
Ah, well,
we made good time.
Lack of freeway congestion
translated
into an average velocity
of 72 miles an hour.
That's great.
Right this way.
Uh, files are necessary
for all personnel on duty
during the time
of the incident.
Training qualifications,
hours of service,
uh, compliance training,
drug and alcohol screening,
medical exams.
It's all there.
Do you want
to inspect the tracks?
Uh, yes,
but after the paperwork.
Uh, interviews should be
scheduled for the engineer,
the conductor, the yard master
security dispatcher,
and once disengaged, the event
recorder should be queried.
Matthew takes his job
very seriously.
I see.
Well, make yourselves
at home.
My office is right down the
hall, if you need anything,
and, uh, oh, for lunch,
there's a couple...
Not necessary.
All righty then.
I'll let you get to work.
Thank you.
Welcome.
:
Yeah.
What the hell?
What? I told you about
my undercover character.
Yeah, you told me he was
a by-the-book guy.
Not a weird and creepy guy.
Hey, it worked, didn't it?
She's leaving us alone.
Ooh.
MAN:
...the FRA is here...
MAN 2: No, they're not
expected till this afternoon.
Hmm.
What are you doing?
You should see this.
MAN: ...if they want
to check out the cabin.
They won't, trust me!
KENSI: Ah!
I've been shredding
on the railroad.
DEEKS:
A locked file.
Fascinating.
TRAGER:
The disk has everything.
Contraband
in Rome's apartment...
That's Trager.
Yeah, and photos with
the ex-con roommate.
The guy's got a rap sheet longer
than a Texas mile.
Pick up the pace.
There is a stairwell
around the corner.
TRAGER: Yeah, nobody's gonna touch that
kid's case with a ten-foot pole.
So, if you need anything else,
keep in touch.
You know where to find me.
Right around here
to the left.
To the left.
To the left, to the left...
Really?
They were right on our tail
in case you didn't notice.
Those things used
to be a quarter
when I was in high school.
KENSI:
He's gone.
We'll just wait
a few more minutes and...
Oh, crap.
You're a handsome devil--
what's your name?
Yeah, the twins have
a birthday party
and soccer on Saturday, so...
Most ladies buy me
a couple of drinks first.
Okay, sounds good, Mom.
Yeah, love you too.
Bye-bye.
Too many feet.
Shh!
Molly, is that you?
No, it's Karen
from the FRA.
CAMPBELL:
Love your boots.
Thank you.
So, how long have you been
working with your partner?
Um, oh, I...
A couple years.
Well, you seem so normal,
but he's seems so...
Different?
Honey...
they ought to be
giving you hazard pay.
You have no idea.
Aah!
CALLEN:
Ivy League motel.
SAM:
So, Bellamy's been here before?
ERIC:
Credit card shows
charges for Harvard House Motel
twice in the last ten months.
Got it.
NELL:
And the stays coincide
with restraining orders
from two ex-girlfriends
after incidents
of domestic violence.
Sounds like a heck of a guy.
Yeah.
Hey, be careful over there.
We know: armed and dangerous.
Uh, no the motel ranks
number two in L.A.
on BedbugScorecard.com.
NELL: So, I'd consider
washing your clothes
on a fairly hot setting
after you leave.
Extra 20 minutes
in the dryer.
Have you seen this guy?
NELL:
Gil Bellamy.
He checked in three days ago
as Frank Babcock.
With a fake I.D.
Expired credit card last time.
I made him pay cash up front.
What room?
Rather not kick down the door.
Thank you.
Mr. Babcock,
the plumbers are here.
Your shower's leaking
through the floor!
You mind if we take
a look around?
Wire!
You all right?
Okay, thanks.
Forensics at the
motel found C-4.
Well, that's no surprise.
He's a construction
demolition guy.
We got a BOLO
out for Bellamy.
And Jillian Rome has been
texting with her son.
"I'm okay, Mom,
don't believe it.
I'm doing the right thing."
If blowing up two federal agents
is doing the right thing.
That was Bellamy's work.
How could Rome be doing
the right thing?
Suppose he's got
a gun to his head.
Rome's cooperating.
Bellamy's forcing him
to do his dirty work.
Message originated
from an industrial area
in Pacoima.
Run kaleidoscope facial rec
and check security
cameras in the area
Got it.
I thought it was a
very simple request
to pull down your pants.
I do not like my trousers
to touch the bathroom floor.
I prefer to pull them
down to my knees.
Well, you could've done that,
shown some wrinkles.
Where do I have wrinkles?
On your pant legs.
A lot more convincing
when she was checking
out your shoes.
Now she's super suspicious.
Can we just think
about the shredder?
Don't you worry
your pretty little head
'cause I have a plan.
Those words always scare me.
Apple?
Yes, actually.
This is frozen.
Mm-hmm, and it's
from the dry ice.
See, regular ice
turns to water,
and gives you
a soggy sandwich.
And what is worse
than a soggy sandwich?
:
Having to listen to you.
I didn't say it,
but I certainly thought it.
That anger management class
was money well spent.
Or not.
Get ready for a big bang.
KENSI:
You sure about this?
Positive.
It's taking way too long.
I think Mercury's
messing with you.
Wait for it.
Showtime.
What the hell was that?
Something blew up!
Everybody out. Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go!
DEEKS:
Incident reports.
Confidential
employee files.
You ready, Kens?
Ready.
Incoming.
We need to leave
the building now.
Uh, not safe, definitely,
definitely not safe.
Matthew is prone
to panic attacks.
The fire department is on
the way. I think we're good.
Oh, it's not good,
it's definitely not good.
Oh, my lips are numb,
I can't feel my fingers...
and I think
I'm having chest pains.
Just breathe
into the bag.
Breathe into the bag!
I'm sorry for all the chaos.
Okay, let's go, come on.
Is it getting dark in here?
Oh, I feel like
it's getting dark in here.
Matthew...
I smell toast.
Do you smell toast?
Why do I smell toast?
Am I having a stroke?
There's no toast.
Gil Bellamy
and Mitchell Rome,
arguing outside a futon
warehouse two hours ago.
Can't decide
on a king or a queen.
One block
from the burn phone text.
CALLEN:
Trouble in paradise.
Looks like the partnership's
not working out so well.
They couldn't agree on a plan
or someone screwed up.
Or Rome just found out
about the rebar
and bombing part of the plan.
Did you get anything
off the hard drive?
They've expunged
all e-mails to and from Rome.
Even off the server.
What about the files?
Rendering now.
Well, there was a whole lot
of shredding going on.
It's a letter from Rome.
CALLEN: "As I have repeatedly
told my supervisors,
"I have serious concerns
about the transport
of hazardous materials
through HTUAs"?
"High Threat Urban Areas."
KENSI: "Materials including
chlorine gas
"anhydrous ammonia
and medical nuclear waste
"have been passing through
residential areas
in violation
of federal standards."
Why do that?
Why take the risk?
Shortest path from point A
to point B is the cheapest.
Complying with indirect routes
could mean
millions in lost revenue.
So Rome was a whistle blower.
They wanted to shut him up.
They could have
rigged his crash.
Tampered with his drug test.
So Rome partnered
with Bellamy for revenge.
But Bellamy's taking it too far.
I got Jillian Rome
calling in.
Put her on speakerphone.
Yep.
Agent Hanna here.
Uh, hi, it's Jillian Rome.
You, uh, you told me to call.
Have you seen your son?
Not yet.
But, um, a friend of his
stopped by the house.
Somebody you know?
No.
What did he look like?
White guy, um, maybe 30.
Uh, he-he told me
that Mitch was okay.
And, um, he dropped off a box
of his stuff.
You think Bellamy
would harm the mom?
How big is the box?
Like for files?
Should I open it?
No!
Get as far away as you can.
We're on our way.
Call the bomb squad,
evacuate the block.
And stay on that shredder--
we need a smoking gun.
You guys came a long way
for nothing.
Looked like the real thing.
Turns out it's nothing
but play putty.
It's orange like RDX.
Wired to an alarm clock?
Like something Wile E. Coyote
used to build.
Someone's got
a sick sense of humor.
Who would do this?
And why?
You recognize this man?
He brought me the package.
Okay.
It's been verified.
Calling it in.
Go ahead, Eric.
Are you with Mrs. Rome?
We are.
You might want
to step away.
G.
Excuse me.
Uh, okay.
SAM:
Go ahead, Eric.
A freight train's been hijacked
in Kern Junction.
It's Bakersfield to the north.
NELL:
An engine
and four tanks
of chlorine gas are heading
for Los Angeles right now.
Bellamy must've knew
we were onto him.
This fake bomb was
a diversion to keep us away.
If those chlorine tankers
explode or derail...
At least a 100,000 deaths.
NELL: I'm sending you a screen grab
from surveillance video.
You can make out the engineer.
Mitchell Rome.
Identity has been confirmed.
You still think he's a good kid?
Where are we?
Approaching Mojave.
All traffic's been cleared.
Homeland's searching the tracks.
Any contact with Rome?
Not answering his radio or cell.
All right, what are our options?
Sniper?
Could cause a crash.
How about a barrier?
A barrier's gonna
cause a derailment.
We'll have the release
of toxic fumes.
Do we need to evacuate the city?
If you want
mass casualties
due to panic.
We could drop in by helicopter.
We could put an engine in front,
match his speed, slow it down.
HETTY:
The clock is ticking.
He'll be here in
less than an hour.
I can get to Hobart yard,
head north on the high rail.
Go.
CALLEN: Eric, video conference
the boatshed.
Where e Kensi and Deeks?
Following up a facial
recognition hit on Bellamy.
MAN :
...is now boarding.
Please have your ticket in hand
for the driver.
Thank you.
DEEKS:
Gambler's special to Vegas.
A lot of bystanders.
That's Bellamy.
Watch and learn.
Clean and surgical.
Cover my back.
Got it.
Anyone got change for a buck?
Anybody got change? You? Hey,
man, you got change for a buck?
I just need change for a dollar.
You got change for a dollar?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Some change for the meter.
Federal agent.
Don't move.
Hey!
This would be a lot easier
if you would've
just listened the first time.
No, no, ma'am,
that's okay, ma'am!
Ma'am, that's okay...
You don't have to...
Wow, that seemed excessive.
Thanks for looking out.
I think your new partner
has your back.
Punk ass!
Thank you for your...
for your help.
Have fun in Vegas!
$10,000 in cash and
a one-way bus ticket to Vegas.
So, what's your game,
huh-- poker?
Blackjack?
No, I take you as
more as a Keno guy.
I want a lawyer.
You gave up your right
to a lawyer
when you blew up
your motel room.
What are you talking about?
It's called the Patriot Act.
You almost killed
two federal agents.
I did express checkout
at 7:00 a.m. this morning.
Someone is setting me up.
Do you have witnesses? Video?
We have a video of you killing
a security guard
at a train yard.
You're crazy.
I've never been
near a train yard.
But your roommate has.
What were you two arguing
about at Pacoima?
The fool wants to raise my rent.
Rome is at the control
of a toxic train
heading
for downtown Los Angeles.
That doesn't surprise me.
He went crazy
after they fired him.
Uh-huh. What's his plan?
Why don't you ask him?
ERIC:
Callen, we got a fix on Rome.
His phone's with him,
but the power's been off.
Until...
now.
Enabling video chat.
Mitchell Rome.
My name is
Special Agent G. Callen.
I need you to stop the train.
Mitch, don't turn that off.
I've got nothing to say.
How about to your mom?
Look, I-I got, I got her
right here with me.
Mom?
Mitch?
Look, I... No one was supposed
to die last night.
That wasn't part of the plan.
I didn't mean
to do anything wrong.
Then stop the train, please.
No, no, I-I got fired
for telling the truth.
I'm trying
to protect the public.
Mitch, we know that
and we're gonna help you
get your message out, okay?
Now, just let's
not do anything stupid here.
I won't.
A lot of people could get hurt.
No, I'm helping a lot of people.
When I'm done here, they'll have
to re-route the hazmat runs.
Mitch, are you working
with Gil Bellamy?
No, this has nothing
to do with Bellamy.
Mitch, you've
made your point.
Let's not take a chance
with something going wrong here.
Nothing's going wrong.
I'm taking this train
to Union Station,
and then I'll stop.
Everyone's got
to know the truth.
Sam's sweeping the tracks
with ATF.
I don't see anything
out there but weeds.
It's a back branch line,
hardly ever used.
CALLEN: Sam, do you know
what you're looking for?
I will when I see it.
Just got word
from the occupational lab.
They thawed out
Rome's drug test.
DNA is not a match.
It's not his urine.
He was framed.
I told you, my son
doesn't do drugs.
ERIC:
More shredded documents
from Fillmore and Western.
Falsified manifests.
They were profiting
by sending
hazardous materials
into populated zones.
My son is telling
the truth.
Unlike his roommate.
DEEKS: Mitch Rome says you two
are working together.
Well, then he's a liar.
What did you tell him?
To stop being such a wuss.
So you told him
to steal the train.
Maybe.
KENSI: Maybe?
See, he says all he wants
is for his message to be heard.
Oh, it'll be heard, all right.
All the way to Long Beach.
Update from Sam in Valencia.
SAM: Camera's on, guys.
We've got the image.
Okay, I've got an IED
on the tracks.
It has three parallel triggers,
including a pressure plate.
Can you render it safe?
Not at the trigger.
It's got a mercury switch,
a trembler--
any movement will set it off.
CALLEN: How big
of a charge we talking?
I couldn't tell you.
It's wireless.
Explosives are somewhere
under the tracks.
Mitch,
listen to me.
Bellamy has placed a bomb
on the tracks in Valencia.
Why would he do that?
Because he's a sociopath.
Now, listen to me.
Mitch, there's 250,000
people in that area.
If you don't stop this train,
you could wipe out
the entire Santa Clarita Valley.
You just want me to stop.
Mitch, I saw it for myself.
You got to trust us, Mitch.
You've made
your point, okay?
Now, stop this
before it turns into a disaster.
Mitch, please.
I'm slowing down.
Eric, Sam,
he's stopping.
Um, it doesn't look like
he's stopping-- in fact,
he's accelerating.
Mitch?
Mitch, talk to me.
You-you said
you were slowing down.
I'm trying.
I got no air pressure.
I don't have any brakes!
Bellamy sabotaged the lines.
I'm going 60 miles an hour.
I can't stop.
Oh, my God.
What about emergency brakes?
No such thing.
Well, maybe I can
uncouple the engine
and leave the tanks behind.
Give it a try.
No, no, we're moving
too fast--
the coupler's jammed.
Uh...
m-maybe I can reverse the
polarity of the engine's motors.
The bomb is three miles ahead.
Uh, no, no, it's too dangerous.
There's no way
I'm gonna stop in time.
Do we have any other option?
Uh, I guess not.
I can't.
I'm braking from the head.
The tank cars are bunching up.
They're gonna derail.
Uh, I need at least
five miles here.
You don't have
five miles.
Okay, then get the bomb
off the track.
Damn it.
Nothing.
You should put on the suit.
What's the point?
If we survive the blast,
the toxic fumes
will still melt our lungs.
CALLEN:
Sam?
They turned over dirt
for 50 yards.
The initiator
could be buried anywhere.
How long is it
gonna take?
An hour to make a clean sweep;
five minutes if we're lucky.
Then get lucky.
ERIC:
Callen...
we found your smoking gun.
An authorization
for a $100,000
cash payment to private eye
Anthony Trager.
That's a lot of money to be
taking pictures of an apartment.
Trager resigned rather than
face corruption charges
in the 1998
Rampart scandal.
Those cops
were accused
of beating suspects,
planting evidence,
and covering up
unprovoked shootings.
Mr. Callen,
if he's playing dirty,
then so must you.
If you want answers,
turn on the news.
Tony Trager's in custody.
Who?
The dirty ex-cop that paid you
ten grand-- Fillmore and Western
paid him with marked bills,
which he passed on to you.
Yeah, I did some carpentry
and plumbing at his house.
Trager confessed.
His job was to make
Rome disappear.
Your job was to plant the
bombs at the apartment
and scout out the rail yard.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
They pay you to blow up
the motel, too?
And put the bombs on the tracks?
Are you asking me or telling me?
If you have all the
answers, why do you
need me?
This bomb goes off
you're looking at
the death penalty.
What bomb?
I have no idea what
you're talking about.
It sounds like
you don't, either.
California doesn't have
the death penalty.
California?
No. We're talking about an
act of federal terrorism.
KENSI: We'll probably have to
put him in Guantanamo,
for his own safety.
Save it.
You're not scaring
a forced confession out of me.
:
Yeah, he's right.
Leave it to the
professionals.
Have the rendition team
get him out of here.
I hear those tube feedings
are delightful.
DEEKS: Just out of curiosity,
how do you say, uh,
"bottoms up" in Arabic?
It's 36 ties from the switch.
...34, 35, 36.
Less than a mile.
How's your speed?
I'm down to 30.
It's still too fast.
You can bail, Mitch.
Jump out
while you can.
I can't let go of the throttle.
I have to try.
Mom?
:
I'm here.
I'm sorry.
There are people
on the track up ahead.
I-Is that where the bomb is?
You've got about 30 seconds.
Nothing but dirt.
Bellamy's a liar!
Let's go!
Maybe he counted
the switch as number one.
MITCH: I can't stop in time.
Why aren't they moving?
You got an eye
on the train, Sam?
I see it.
Bingo!
Bricks of C-4 and a receiver.
Get them off the track!
I'm not gonna make it.
Attacking the initiator.
Pray the power dump
doesn't set it off.
Don't be a fool!
Get out!
Sam?
Piece of cake.
Hey.
Well, hey,
how are you two doing?
Great. Just finishing
up some stuff.
Good.
Hey, you know
that guy, Rome?
Yeah.
Hijacked a train.
Yeah, I heard, huh?
What a loser.
Huh.
Well, I guess he won't be
suing the railroad now.
:
Not a chance.
Oh, listen,
just out of curiosity,
what are you, uh,
what are you up to?
Eh, boring stuff.
Preemployment background
checks, that sort of thing.
Gotta pay the bills, huh?
Well, 90 grand pays
a lot of bills.
What do you got in your,
uh, your murse there.
You got fifties... or hundreds?
KENSI: Yeah,
that's right.
Bellamy told us everything.
Yeah, well,
Bellamy's a lowlife scum.
Who you were
dumb enough to hire.
Oh, come on, really?
You're gonna shoot
federal agents?
You already murdered
a security guard.
DEEKS: Bellamy couldn't
make it, so you filled in.
KENSI: Where'd
you learn Arabic?
That "Allahu Akbar""
that was a nice touch.
Mm.
Very convincing.
Yeah.
Well... innocent
until proven guilty.
Gotta go.
Oh, thank you.
I will take that.
Sing along if you
know the words.
DEEKS & KENSI: You have the
right to remain silent.
Anything you say
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.
What is this?
KENSI :
Oh, don't even ask.
Why does she need the reports tonight?
'Cause we got about
a hundred federal agencies
begging for the intel.
DHS, FBI,
NRC, DOJ, DOT, TSA...
Okay, okay, okay.
Where's Deeks?
DEEKS: Oh! I think I just
broke a hoof.
Transformer's
looking pretty good.
Here you go.
Ah, thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
Yeah, it was a gift
from Mitch Rome.
He's gonna let me
babysit it for a few months
until he gets out of prison.
You may not want
to run this thing tonight.
Yeah, probably not
for a couple weeks.
At least not until
Mercury's out of retrograde.
You guys can laugh it up
all you want, but, uh,
did anyone's travel plans
go awry today?
Just like every day on the 405.
Come on, you guys,
there were signs everywhere.
Mitch Rome.
Mercury's a Roman god.
The name
of the bus station.
What about it?
Maximus Lines-- that's
the home temple of Mercury,
the Circus Maximus.
Oh...
SAM: Well, you know,
in ancient Rome,
they spoke Latin.
DEEKS: Mm.
And on the radio today, Latin music.
He's right.
Okay, you two are
pretty cute together.
But the fact is that you
couldn't disarm the bomb
because it had a
mercury trigger.
I'm just, I'm thinking
that's interesting.
CALLEN:
Uh-huh.
You going to chisel your report
in stone, Mr. Deeks?
Yeah, I was just... putting
the last final touches on it.
Oh...
This?
HETTY:
That...
is an Airfix Prairie Tank.
DEEKS: Yeah.
HETTY: Oh! That's a classic!
It is, indeed.
Does it work?
Oh, yeah, this is
gonna be great.
I mean, Christmas is
coming early this year.
I've been dreaming
about this, Hetty,
since I was, like, five years old.
DEEKS: Hetty, see, I-I haven't
fully secured the tracks!
Make it stop, Hetty! No! Aah!
SAM: Mercury's a bitch, ain't it?
