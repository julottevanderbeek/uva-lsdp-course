Hello?
Good morning, is your mother in?
Are your ready?
I need to go now.
Jesus, the son of God...
...descended to earth and suffered...
...to pay for our sins.
*You're in danger.
*I don't care
as long as I'm near you.
*I never thanked you for your help.
*It was brave, very courageous.
*I've never seen you so beautiful.
*I think I'm in love with you.
*You'll come with me to the police ?
* No.
*Why?
*I killed Charles Ringan.
*Would you tell the Commissioner?
*Yes, if you ask it.
*I don't want to.
*Listen, I'm very tired, I feel stiff.
*I killed a man and I witnessed
the murder of a poor soul.
*It's all because Geiger sang Carmen.
*If I told, your house would
be invaded by police...
*...before you'd have time to flee.
*Perhaps she'll recover.
I've seen it in the past.
*We'll let your father know about Ringan.
*You forgot something.
*Me?
*What do you have?
*Nothing you can't heal.
OH!
"The Slide Whistle Micmacs"
If I extract the bullet,
he'll be a vegetable.
If I don't extract it,
he'll be living on a knife edge.
Better to be alive and at risk of dying...
...then to be dead.
This is closer to philosophy then medicine.
Heads or Tails?
Heads!
OK, I'll leave it.
It'll ring the alarms at airports!
They changed the lock.
What happened,
did you comb your hair with a tinopener?
Where's my stuff?
Initially, in the cellar.
But you know people...
After 3 days, there was
little more than odd socks.
That's my hat
Hey...
My little Bazil...
For you, fell off the back of a truck.
You've a job, you'll find accommodation.
Good morning.
Is Serge in?
Well! If it isn't Bazil!
You've come back!
I almost didn't.
I hope they took the lead
from your head.
I'm back, faithful to the position.
But the position was not faithful to you.
I had to replace you.
This is Lola.
Three month trial.
We just signed a permanent contract .
Ah...
Well, we haven't kissed...
Mister Bazil!
Don't listen to him.
In fact, I have a boyfriend.
His name's Ricardo.
He picks me up every night on his motorbike.
He always parks there.
Where you were shot.
One day, while riding...
We heard a little noise,
like a pebble stuck in the tire.
Mr Bazil, it was no pebble.
Which hand?
Make an effort.
*She puts her head under her feet
and her toes in her nose
*And then does the splits*
*She spins and
coils like a caterpillar*
*Suddenly, her legs around his neck*
*She spins, like ball
And nibbles his knees*
*The rubber woman*
* With her, what fun they can have
Ah, it's crazy*
*It's enough
to make you go funny in the head*
*They search below
And they find it underneath*
*The rubber woman*
Thank you...
Have you five minutes?
I spent my life in jail.
So they call me "Closet".
I'm Bazil.
I know.
You're a sweet in jar.
You've been on the streets for 2 months,
but you've not submerged, you have a purpose.
What is it?
I live day to day.
With the bullet,
that can make me trip out anytime.
Me, the widow maker gave me
this injury.
The guillotine in 59.
The guillotine jammed.
It happened 2 times.
I was pardoned.
Get that bullet out of your head.
Impossible.
The surgeon said...
Because...
You follow me.
A family will adopt you.
Hi.
Hi!
That's Max.
Here we're home.
We share our home.
This is our little goose of the Capitol.
If the robber is pointing...
Whistle blasts
Ha! Ha!
Go, go, my little guy.
Come in, don't be shy.
Wakey...
Come, let me introduce...
For recruitment,
it's she who decides.
You collect stray bullets?
Yes, ma'am.
Say!
I'm Tambouille.
Here stuff is recovered,
we sort and repair it.
Everybody together.
Even little Pierre.
And he's an artist.
He brings anything we can use.
59...
Nickel.
She's called "Calculator".
Father and motherland unknown.
He has a compass in his eye.
The white man

begins at the top...
...and goes from cock to the ass.
Yes!
"The compass in the eye".
Note.
He was a writer in Brazil.
Fracasso is my name.
I have carbon staples...
...in my throat.
He lost a lung in a
water bottle explosion
...and also have a cycle Dynamo
in my stomach

Well, go ahead, tap away.
Go ahead, it's titanium!
Go!
Go ahead!
Oh!
He dreams of getting his name
in the Guinness Book of Records.
I already did. in 77!
We never saw
the certificate.
I was robbed!
I've told you already.
Hey, you!
Why do you get him upset?
Now that you belong to the
Family...
...get me a small pot of cream
from the fridge.
Further down, boy!
Aaaahh!
You want a picture?
She's a little snappish...
...but she's always the first
to bend for others...
You're a contortionist?
No, I am the vegetable crisper!
She was like that from birth...
At 5, she was already hiding
in the pantry.
And he remained so long
in the closet...
...without laces in his shoes
that he's forgot how to tie them!
Come!
Go to the table, the mash is ready.
*Speaking a Flemish dialect*
Can I help you?
Yes, I would like to see Mr. De Fenouillet.
Of course,
you have an appointment?
That is to say,
I have something in mind.
It concerns him.
If this is a project or idea,
send an email.
I could send him a scan,
but I prefer to see him.
You'll have to leave.
Yes. Warning!
Warning!
Warning! Warning!
Boo!
Show this clown to the street, that's all.
A bullet in the head?
At least he'll remember us!
Guys, I need someone here!
Go!
*You know we're leaders...
*...in the field of cluster munitions.
*We have quadrupled our sales
in the Gulf countries...
*...decreased by 7 to 9% on collateral damage.
*As you know, we're not monsters.
*We don't want anyone's death.
*We all know well...
*...a wounded soldier is more expensive
than a dead soldier!
*Our CBS87 disperses
*...and cleans the equivalent
of 4 football fields.
*We have been present in the Gulf, Kosovo...
*...in Afghanistan...
In short, it's time to call...

the architect of our success.
*Our CEO:
Fran√ßois Marconi!
*Thank you, Thank you.
Thank you very much.
*Tracers...
*...explosives or bullets...
*...ours are the best...
*...the most aggressive and successful.
*Rimbaud started as a poet
finally as an arms dealer.
*Well, I...
I'll do the opposite.
*But until retirement...
*...I will continue to rhyme
ambition with ammunition...
*...Living with dynamite.
*Long live Vigilante Armament!
Goodnight, Mr. President.
General...
Joseph, good night!
I remind you...
...of the new rule in force.
A landmine was placed under the playing surface.
Yes, it is a renewed challenge...
...offered by the league.
The suspense was short lived
as the frontcenter...
...the visiting team
just payed the price.
You were brilliant tonight.
Thank you, Georges.
Arthur Rimbaud was an arms dealer, in history?
Yes, but it didn't prevented him dying
of gangrene, when they amputated his leg.
Baudelaire, of syphilis?
Verlaine, delirium tremens...
...Lorca was shot...
...Nerval hanged himself from a lamppost.
I will never encourage my son to
become a poet, sir.
Tomorrow,
wake me up at 10am
Yes, sir.
You've worked for us long?
30 years next month.
Ah...
Why don't we...
...upgrade this place for your 30 years?
With some hightech equipment.
The old pots make the best soups.
Hum...
Change is coming.
At least once every 30 years.
Why can't he sleep at the foot of the bed?
Stop moaning!
Birds of a Feather.
*Hey, Grandma?
*Croutons!
The day went well?
Yes, papa!
I was brilliant tonight.
My Speech was fantastic,
I was compared to Rimbaud.
You know who he is?
Yes, but your not that muscular.
No, not "Rambo", darling, "Rimbaud".
Put him to bed.
Yes, Sir.
*Hello, Yes.
*No, wait...
How did you get this number?
Yes, I see.
No, not this kind of transaction,
not over the phone.
No! No more...
I prefer a public place.
I know...Say Wednesday...
*...3pm, the sports department
of Galeries Lafayette.
Yes, that's it.
Waffles...
...d'Brussels!
Don't eat too much, I put rum in the batter.
Hey, stop!
*Speaking in Flemish dialect*
*She speaks Chinese*
Hurry, the minots!
They'll be ready soon!
Mr Fracasse...
Isn't this you, here in the
Guinness Book of Records?
Yikes!
The 77!
What did I tell you!
What did I tell you...
Ha! Ha!
"On July 14, 1977,
Theodore Henri de Montreuil"...
Who is Theodore Henry?
..."beat by 9 meters...
..."the record for human-canonball
established by Mr. Grampee in 66"! Ha!
"Beat by 9 meters"!
Yes!
You'll give it me, kid?
Oh no.
Ah yes, please, you give me.
But no...
If you give me....
You sign my T-shirt, then.
"T. Henri"...
Thierry Henri.
Fracasso, I have a job for you.
I'm not joking...
...but I think
there's a catch.
You've an idea in mind?
Mister poses a mystery.
Well, who cares, you're not curious.
Oh...Oh!
What time?
Tomorrow, 10am,
opposite the tomb of Sacha Guitry.
Mister Marconi?
I am the messenger
of Omar Boulounga.
Omar Boulounga...
The former dictator...?
The former and the next.
He's preparing a revolution.
I don't have a polical view.
We require rifles, grenades and mines.
And the DGA, the Export Committee,
the Ottawa Treaty?
You have the weapons.
In stock.
You don't have an export sector in Zamibia.
We'd like one.
And this should interest me?
Check us out.
We'll give you double the cash and more...
in diamonds if the coup succeeds.
Continue.
Mr. Bouloungas' national account...
...the diamond mines...
Don't Sneeze!
Think of something, fast!
Zebras are white with black stripes
or black with white stripes?
Oh, pygmies!
Are there dwarfs among pygmies?
Why do we say "CIA" and not "ifeow"?
Or "fbiouch" and not "FBl?
Think...
...but do not delay too much,
we returned to Conakry Monday.
You!
Yes, You!
I don't know what your shenanigans
are about...
...but either you go and continue
doing everything alone...
...or stay and ask us for help.
Am I clear?
Some of them want to help me?
What?
I found the manufacturer of the bullet
that killed my father.
I need to do two things at once
- I can't do it alone.
Stick together...
They're the watchmen.
Inside is the dealer.
The drug's hidden in the mailbox.
That way, if they're ever searched...
...they are white as snow. Let's go!
You've already done it for the crash
and whiplash at the same time?
You're old school.
Yes?
Asbestos Control. A problem was reported.
But there's no asbestos here!
We didn't find asbestos in
the devil vauvert.
From the crack of dawn...
...we dealt with that problem.
So, no need to rock the boat.
Ah!
Oh! But...
The widow told me she'd
never leave.
Wherever I go, it's on my back.
Hats off!
And my receipt?
The more one drinks, the more one is right!
The boarding hall, please?
My brother, you want a magical necklace?
Get you into heaven.
This powder wards off evil spirits.
But yes! Ha! Ha!
Ah, you're the boss? Commander!
Here!
It will protect you against the devil...
...and the vagaries of fate.
Incense that'll allow you to contact
the deceased.
Let the passengers be!
I've told you a 100 times!
This is your last warning. Get away!
Sorry, gentlemen.
Wishing you a safe journey.
Excuse me, please
sir.
Hello.
We're seeking the plane to America.
The departure hall?
Yes, we go to Manhattan to visit...
...my son.
You must register your baggage before.
It's half-sister...
...my son who left in 1989 for New York.
New York...
You're talking to me?
In 1988.
On December 12, 1988.
*Last call for Conakry*
*Lufthansa Flight 202*
The vertebra of Tino Rossi.
Winston Churchills
Fingernail clippings.
The molar of Marilyn...
Monroe.
The foot of Salma Lazarus...
Heart of Louis XVI.
The finger of Matisse.
The eye of Mussolini...
It is expected that the DGA launched the study
and called the Saudis...
Yes, it was an individual effort more
than group...rather well done.
Well, they will not provide the
source code.
If it works?
Remember the Sarajevo market...
Collateral damage added value
in the media.
But of course...
That's why it kills me to say.
You and me, we work...
...in the defense industry...
...not in the attack industry.
I beg you, dear friend.
You are always welcome.
My respects to madame.
I'm already 10 minutes late,
hurry!
What was that, Maurice?
"Etienne", sir.
Etienne, yes!
We have a puncture, I think.
Sorry, I'll see.
Peasant!
Hello.
I have a reservation
in the name of De Fenouillet.
Yes.
You are expected.
I am the right hand of
Mr. De Fenouillet.
He asked me to tell you that the
eye of Mussolini interests him
In exchange for Achilles heel and
Adam's apple of...
I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.
Go ahead, make me an offer.
Do not put the cart
before the horse. It will save us...
...from having 2 feet
in the same hoof.
If you have the eye of Mussolini...
...I'll give you the molar of Marilyn.
It's worth it.
I've got the finger of Matisse
and fingernails Churchill...
...name the price.
What say you, Mr. Lazarus?
Mr. Lazarus has had a setback,
he had to leave.
Unfortunately,
Mr. Lazarus had to stand you up.
He's returned to his household.
Who are you?
I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.
Boulounga?
I thought...
We were done?
Nay.
A popular revolution...
A popular revolution...
...Omar will return where
Omar belongs.
I'm not interested in politics.
It doesn't feed you bread...
Double the cash...
...plus more diamonds...
...if the usurper...
...takes to his heels
and we get back Boulounga.
When, how and where?
Tuesday, 27th, one of your men.
Just one...
...will be at the station at 14.45 with the samples.
He'll buy a ticket for Crecy-la-Chapelle and leave...
...with a deposit....
...of 30% Cash...
...dollars and cents.
Well?
The operator's transferring me.
Marconi?
Omar Boulounga in person.
So you thought?
Ha! Ha!
Congratulations, you're now looking at noon to 2pm.
I didn't invent sliced bread...
...but I don't mistake candles
for lanterns.
Well, I want one man
present...
...with samples at the
Gare de l'Est tomorrow at 14.45.
He'll get a ticket
for La Ferte-Milon.
He'll leave with the 1st
installment of the order. ok?
Right. Ok!
Ready for more, guys?
Why "guys"?
Well, because there'll be action.
Ah! When there's action, it's not for girls?
Preconception...
Uh...
You're not a real...
Real what?
A real girl! Is that it?
I wouldn't say that.
If that's it.
No.
Is it! Is that what you wanted to say.
No.
Did you mean I'm a 'Tomboy'?
That's right.
When I have to fold into a bag,
I'm in the club!
*Ladies and gentlemen,
arms traffickers...*
*...currently waiting in the station.*
*Be vigilant.*
*Don't buy a land mine from
a dealer on the run.*
*You risk him using it.*
*Thank you for your attention.
Wow! What's that?
1 kg 720 steel,
...70 grammes of kevlar.
And that's not a small Uzi is it?
It is a MAC 10, maybe even 11.
No, no!
You step on it, it'll off your foot!
Oh...
Or your life, perhaps.
Hold there!
That's for recycling!
It's not for us.
I didn't recycle it,
it fell off the back of a tank!
Confiscated!
Thurs tomorrow, play naughty!
Or is Scarface and his return to Chicago!
If I wasn't here...
Ready for Phase 2?
Strike while the iron is hot!
Let's draw!
De Fenouillet, here's Boulounga.
Your man didn't turn up!
The deal is obsolete.
Vigilante Armament offered me better.
Make a cross on diamonds and
butter in the spinach.
Marconi Boulounga for Omar.
If you could do it a bit more sober.
Marconi? Boulounga is pissed!
Your boy took to his heels.
The deal is dead and gone.
Aubervilliers Armaments are
better customers. Goodbye!
Tambouille,
I have to go out between 1 and 2pm.
Your 2 sharks have taken the bait?
For now, they're biting.
I'm...
...just going to sweeten the pot!
But when it bites, it will be well hooked...
It's big.
Then I...
Then 'We'...
We'll turn the screws.
No, not until we see their faces.
Not Gay, Gay.
Lookout!
Lookout.
Yes. Oh well...
I need volunteers to go on the roofs.
Thank you, calculator.
It's good to have people who count.
Good...
Uh...where are you going then?
Well, wherever you go.
Excuse me, but I must handle a delicate matter.
I prefer to go alone.
Ah, I understand.
It's true that in matters of delicacy...
...and even subtlety...
...you're an expert.
"The diva of porn",
she'll please you!
Something of a pencil sharpener!
Great, but do you own a nightgown.
I sleep naked.
Hey, Henry...
...you spell Henri...
...not with a Y but with an I.
Oh? Are you sure?
Thierry Henri?
Yeah.
It would be wrong, Thierry Henry?
Do not worry, I'm always game
for the Cyclops sneeze.
Well, we'll do as you ask?
Yeah.
Soon.
This evening.
What?
I thought...
...you're fishing for shark,
not cod or herring!
We're not married.
No, we're not married.
Anyway,
perverts are not my thing.
Mine's like...
with contortionists.
My mother always told me
to distrust twisted...
I am not twisted.
I am a sensitive soul
in a flexible body.
That's not the same
Hello?
Listen to me.
You listen to me!
Camel!
I despise your shenanigans!
Put the Boulounga diamonds
where you like!
Dickless! It appears that the teeth, fingers...
...the bones of the Assyrian kings,
the looting of the Baghdad museum...
If you want war,
think twice about it!
When one is fortunate to have divorced...
*...to advantage, one doesn't choose as a mistress...
...the wife of the Prime Minister.
I also have the recording at home.
Well, gotta say...
...that Grandpa and Grandma
did it in the dark...
So doing it in front of everyone...
...is just a little more dramatic...
...a little more creative,
a little more flexible, right?
Bazil! Hey!
Boo!
Oh...
Let's go.
And, I'm not too much girl to act the alley cat?
No, precisely why we needed a person...
Flexible!
We needed someone like you,
feline and female.
Oh dear...
Marignan?
1515.
Nagasaki?
17 kilotonnes.
Kiss?
Hello, sir.
Something happened during the night.
It's most unusual.
Sir!
Come on, Maurice.
"Etienne", Sir.
I have a delivery for
Mr. De Fenouillet
You're out of luck,
he just left.
Leave it to me.
It's a bit heavy.
Ah...
Go ahead.
There.
7 meters, 50 centimeters, 4 millimeters.
The same rubber
With her, you can go crazy
She'll send you funny in the head
It seeks the above
And is found below
The same rubber
Pip squeak.
You've washed your hands?
YES!
Let's see.
Hey, you!
There is no laughing at the table.
She imitates.
Where are you,
with thy merchants of death?
They're hooked! The more they struggle
the more their trapped.
Oh...When I think of
those poor mothers...
...who lose their children
because of mines.
You know Tambouille?
She had 2 little girls.
One evening at the Foire du Trone...
...she saw them enter
the labyrinth.
She never saw them come out.
For years, she has searched
the streets.
Eventually, she became a tramp.
And after all that,
She adopted us.
Fifififi...
Enough, my lowly masses.
What can you see my
little salty?
Fats: 62%, proteins: 4%...
OH!
Ben who?
A little salty is as it should be...
...a black belt
at Cordon Bleu.
Oh, surely not...
Even if...oh no.
You've got an idea for cooking
your 2 big fish?
Frying.
There's more to roll in flour.
In the flour!
Fracasso, no doubts?
No! He has no doubts.
Go! We will balance the Fracasse!
It blows.
Calculator!
Distance: 138 meters.
Wind Speed: 12 km/h,
Direction South/SouthWest.
There.
Weight of the projectile?
76 kilos.
Add 4.
It's Tambouilles fault.
OK...say 80.
Why did you add more?
Slice: 70 grammes.
Butter: 37 g. Jam...
Okay, okay!
Come on, get ready.
Remington!
For the committees approval!
*Engine!
It's time to go.
No, it's too early. 59...
...
55 secondes.
Oh!
Closet, well then?
What? It's recycled!
It's old...
Oh!
Closet!
You Bastard!
But it's recycled!
Fire!
Watchout!
Come on, move!
Watchout!!
No batteries?!
How?!
It's recycled.
It's recycled?!
I broke the altitude record!
And I had proof!
One Minute, butterfly!
What?!
I devoted myself to the the filming!
That's the last straw!
No Battery!
It's an unwritten law:
One key to the equipment.
It's going to explode.
It's her.
Code 5, no quarter.
You are Madame Cisse?
Yes.
Your husband has a problem.
What happened?
Your husband is ashamed:
He lost your residency permit.
Then I only have to request a duplicate.
That's what I did with Edward Mangin...
...to my friend the Prefect of Police.
But your record as not been found.
But I assure you...
Hmmmm?
Who are you?
I'm part of the company that
employs your husband.
You see, our activities relate to...
...national defense.
At the same time, obviously...
...we feel obliged to protect children...
I always try to put pressure on my friend Mangin
That's good,
I'm seeing him tomorrow night.
I know, you know what?
Show him.
In all Arsenals, they have the same machine.
You see where she is?
It's essential, it must be installed with...
...bulkhead opening on the outside...
...like that.
This has been done to guide the air out...
...in case of...
...technician activainge the machine
behind the door...
Ideally we would proceed...
...during lunch, when the machine is paused.
What should I do?
Almost nothing.
You unscrew the small tube here,
you slide the steel ball out...
...and that's all.
It's dangerous?
Returning to Somalia...
is dangerous too.
I put it where?
Ah!
Do not bother to clean the
dust underneath.
You have a moment?
It's forbidden to park here
with this load.
Don't worry, I'll be quick.
By God!
It's odd.
Usually, he warns me.
In the time of his father,
you would not have come.
There's nothing to sign?
No.
Thank you very much.
Bazil, this blackmail evidence, what is it?
It may be a video...
...tape, envelopes,
photos...
It can be anything
and anywhere.
Thank's for the clarification.
From there, please.
That slab...
Where's this package?
I understand, it was there.
The nanny has put it away?
No, your son is with his mother.
His mother...
Ah yes, true.
Get me the package.
I assure you...
Just go.
Oh, this'll be sweet...
*...this afternoon in Aubervilliers Arsenal...*
*...doing extensive damage.*
* No casualties were reported.*
*An investigation is underway
to determine the causes.*
*...recall the CEO
Nicolas Thibault de Fenouillet...*
*...has been cited in cases of influence peddling...*
*...but he's not been replaced at this time.*
*I defy anyone to make...*
*Rubbish.*

Calm, calm...Breath.
Practice:
The key issues.
Number 12: Who...
...invents jokes?
No. 27: Why is the place we seek on a
map always in the fold?
No. 62: How much erosion is caused by walking?
*The CEO,
Nicolas Thibault de Fenouillet...*
*...has been cited in cases of influence peddling...*
*...and has been fired.*
*Ah! Rubbish!*
*...no tangible evidence!*
*It's a setup.*
*Ongoing information on LCI.*
So you want war?
It will be the blitzkrieg!
Sir, We Have a go?
Go!
Go.
Go.
Go!
Ah! What now!...
That's it then?
You thought we'd rot in prison?
You're impressed by our rresolve?
Exercise # 8: Money...
Dough, cash, money, moola, wonga, lucre, grease...
...dosh, pennies!
Yeah!
No!
Tut tut tut...Hush.
Oh...
Oh! No!
I came to give you a little lesson...
...but these clowns gave me another idea.
Oh no...
How?
You'd never take such a risk.
What risk?
You refused to sell arms to rebels
who were formenting a coup.
They planted a bomb in Arsenals...
...before coming to attack you!
We rushed to your aid...
Isn't that so, Libarski?
We arrived a bit too late.
This is perfect.
Wait, wait...
Ah!
I'll give you the tape with the evidence.
The teeth, fingers, the looting of Baghdad Museum.
You take it and you leave.
It's not enough.
Oh, okay,
stop your bullshit!
Ok,
I would not have sabotaged your plant.
But you stole my shells.
What shells?
Well...
...the shell truck.
You stole a shell truck.
We did what?
No.
It wasn't us.
The truck, wasn't me.
It was probably them.
Yes, it must be them.
Him...it's him!
He was spotted in the video!
He was disguised as a server!
I thought he worked for you.
I thought he worked for you...
...dirty trick number 2.
What madness!
Who do you work for?
Er...I'm on my own.
I have a bachelor flat.
We'll question him there?
My car is outside.
I'm not too early!
You're late.
The problem is over.
That's him.
Oh...
Aeschylus died after...
...a turtle hit his head.
JeanBaptiste Lully,
died of gangrene.
Barbarossa, by forgetting to remove
his armor to cross a river.
And me, I'm dying stupidly too,
feeling like a jerk.

Emergency!
Everyone out!

And you, recognise this?
Shhh! Tut tut tut...
Don't move.

You want a ransom?!
Demand a price  we can afford it.
I'm Friends...
...with the President of the Republic.
Take away this grenade, it's ridiculous!
We'll call,

Articulate, idiot!
What do you want?
Sorry...
...for the kids.
Ah yes...
Sorry.
Apologies to the women...

I sell weapons to people
who stop wars.

Landmines!
I'm for terrorism.
Me too.
The Boeing 300 who died in Ankara...
The explosive were ours!
You were using  I was providing...

And Darfur, where do you think
they get their explosives from?
You encouraged the markets?
Kind of pathetic!

As soon as the 2 merchants of death hit the floor...
...Bazil, proud as Lucifer,
beat his breast and made amends...
There's no need
to be a genius...
...to understand that they would
see with eyes of Chimene.
And it was no secret...
...they get along like a house on fire.
