Ahh!
A-boo! A-boo!
Hey. Hey, you.
Hey, why don't you call Peggy?
That, uh, that show that
you like is on tonight, isn't it? Um...
Hey! Hey, cutie.
What's the name of it?
Um...
Aw, come on, Linda.
You're making me feel
very guilty here.
Look, it's just gonna be
for a couple of hours.
I deserve this. I haven't
been out of the house
for over three months.
Three months.
Gee, that's probably exactly
how long it's been...
since I've been out.
Looks like Mike almost
has his date for tonight.
'Cause I'm so studly.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Linda.
Nobody is taking dates.
It's a bunch of guys going
to a boxing match. That's it.
What?
Wh... Why are you lookin'
at me like that?
'Cause I know your friends.
They have the hormones
of high school kids.
Don't start accusin' me
of runnin' around.
You're the only one
who has a family.
It's time you start hangin' out with
grown-ups.
My friends are grown-ups.
Oh. Sorry.
- What the hell is that?
-
Oh!
- Here's one of your grown-up friends now.
- I gotta go.
Go. Go and have some fun.
Maybe you'll stop walkin' around
with that look on your face.
Say good-bye.
I have no regrets, okay?
Whatever you say.
Bye, gorgeous.
Daddy's gotta go.
I love you.
I love you too.
I'll be home early, okay?
Yeah, Linda.
Say, around, uh, 8:00 a.m.
-
- Oh.
Thanks. I'm on the couch
tonight for sure.
That's simple, Frank;
she hates me.
She does not hate you.
I've been married
to that woman for two years.
Ah, remember your birthday?
She hates you.
Hey!
Hey!
- Let me get rid of these bums,
I'll be back to get on you.
- Promise?
Check it out inside, man.
It's bigger than your house.
Whoo!
Prepare to have your
pleasure glands carpet-bombed.
Watch out for the floors,
'cause they're marble.
Ohh.
You guys.
Wow.
Whoo!
Cool system, man.
Thanks.
Don't, uh, touch anything, okay?
That's not right for you.
And don't put your dirty dogs
on my clean upholstery either.
Ray, where the hell
did you get this thing?
I promoted it.
You what?
I conned the dealer into letting me
take it out for the evening.
Well, how did you do that?
Well, I was driving
past the dealership...
and I was thinking about this
evening, so I go inside and say...
"This baby is perfect for
entertaining clients and I
was thinking about using it...
to buy a few
for my sales force,"
at which time he got
on his hands and knees,
begging me to take it out.
Wait, wait.
Your "sales force," Ray?
Mm-hmm.
I may have some.
And I will.
Tomorrow I'll return it and say,
"Thank you, but under
very careful consideration...
"I would have to say,
it's not big enough.
"I need a driver's side
air bag in the bathroom.
And I'll see ya."
Naaah!
Ray Cochran,
the man, the myth.
Yes, indeed. We're running late.
Where's Eddie?
Eddie canceled at the last minute,
so I invited someone else.
- Who'd you invite?
-
- Hey, no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-
That's your little brother.
Ray, don't start. Linda's
been bustin' my balls
since I got home, okay?
Ray, give him
a break, man.
John's a good guy, bro.
He's a g...
He's a pain in the ass!
Every time you guys
get together, man,
it's like a slugfest.
-
- He's my brother, I invited him.
That's cool.
It's nice.
What the hell is this thing?
Just get in.
Mike, where you been, buddy?
Jesus, look at this thing.
Yo, bro.
My big brother
actually invites me
to go somewhere, huh?
- You sick or somethin', Frank?
- You're late, as usual.
Crack open some libations,
let's get on the road.
- Beers are in the fridge, John.
- Ooh! Beer!
that's
...
Your boy's about to get beat!
What's he doing?
He needs to bob and weave!
Look at that!
Thank God this thing has
a satellite dish, right?
Much better than sitting
ringside, Ray, much better!
Look at him go!
Yeah!
Oh! Oh!
Yeah!
Hit him!
Hit him!
- Hell, yeah, look at him go, man!
-
See his feet?
His legs are bucklin'.
Hernandez
and that Martinez kid
won't last three rounds.
- We're gonna miss the main event.
- We should just settle in and...
Bullshit. We're not
gonna miss anything.
Just shut that TV off.
- Hey, Ray, take it easy.
- Do you want to make it
to the fight on time or not?
...
Oh, shit.
-
-
He's not gonna let me in.
- Hey! How about it, huh? Can we get in?
- How about what?
- Can we get over?
-
- Forget it. Hey, stop!
- You gonna let us over?
-
- Ray, this guy's not stoppin'.
Back off already.
I'm not gonna back off.
What are you doing?
-
- Oh, this guy hit me! He just hit me!
-
-
Fuck you!
What are you doin'?
Fuck you!
You want some, come on!
Fuck you!
-
- Kick this motherfucker's ass.
Yeah? Let's see something,
you little fuckin' weasel!
Let's see what you got!
Get off me, Frank!
Get off me!
Not tonight, man.
I didn't think so.
What?
- Fuck you!
- Come on, John Boy! I'll beat
the shit outta both of you!
Hey, buddy, back off.
Hey, what's this?
What do ya got...
Aaah! Aah!
Don't!
Hey! It hurts, huh?
Huh?
- Leave him alone.
- Yeah, relax...
Aaah! Aah!
And take
the pretty girl home...
- unless you want me to, huh?
-
Huh? I can't hear you.
I'm sorry. What?
Yeah, all right.
Come on, buddy.
You're not worth it.
Nice job, buddy.
Shut up, man!
I can't believe people
in this fuckin' town!
Calm down, honey.
Married life
makin' you soft, Frank?
I remember when your brother
would've dumped that guy
on his ass.
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
You can't get into it...
with every asshole
that looks at you funny.
There's a lot of craziness
goin' on out there.
You never know what maniac
is gonna blow your goddamn
brains out!
It happens every day
in this city!
You listen to me!
What, Frank?
What are you gonna do?
You're not
my father, Frank.
Hey.
What did I say, huh?
You remember what I said?
I know, I'm sorry.
Don't encourage him
with that macho shit.
I'm sorry, Frank.
But he's right, you know.
What are you
talkin' about?
You're not his father, bro.
- That was really smart, baby brother.
- Enough, Ray. All right?
- Stop acting like you're three.
- Why do you always have to
say shit like that?
Hey,
let's knock it off!
I wanna have a good
fuckin' time tonight, all right?
Everybody hold on to somethin'.
We're gettin' outta here.
What the hell
are you doin'?
I tell you something;
I'm not gonna miss this fight.
I hate being late!
Whoo! Come on!
Whoo!
Yes! Yes!
Wha-hoo!
Whoo! Whooooooo!
Oh, my God!
I bet there's some
tremendous real estate
bargains down here.
That's great, but where's
the damn expressway, huh?
Enough of this scenic route.
We hit the next intersection
and cut over.
Don't you worry about it.
...
Ray, I'm just bein' logical.
When you're lost,
you ask for directions.
So let's ask those guys.
They look like they know
their way around.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Mr. Welcome would like to ask
you something!
Give me that!
- You know what? That's not funny.
- Ooh, here they come, Ray!
Ooh, here they come.
They're comin' to party!
There they go!
- How are ya?
- Show 'em, man.
Show 'em what you got.
Check it out.
All right. Watch this.
- Oh, shit!
-
-
- How is that funny? Tell me,
'cause I don't get it!
-
- Get us back on the expressway.
- Jesus!
-
Whoa, wait.
What?
You really know how
to use this thing, Razor?
Beretta 9mm.
Shit happens, man.
You were right, Frank;
you never know what maniac's
gonna pull out a gun.
About the only maniac
I know is you.
Hey, you know what we need?
We need a friggin' map.
Who carries a map?
Thousands of unarmed people
who drive Hyundais
carry maps, Ray.
I think there's a map
in the glove compartment, man.
Right.
Well... Here it is.
You're a little closer
than I am.
- Oh, hey, hey!
-
Who... What was that?
No, we didn't.
Ray, I felt it.
I think we hit someone.
You know where the hell we are?
They're scam artists, okay?
- They make a living doing this.
- Doing what, Ray?
Run out into the street,
pretend to get hit
and blow your head off!
Somebody
might be hurt, Ray.
I'm gonna check it out.
What are you... Frank!
Wh... Hey. Hey!
Nothin' down here.
He's dead.
Think again, asshole.
Shit!
Be careful!
Easy, easy, easy.
Come on, don't move.
It's gonna be all right.
- What's happening?
- We hit somebody! Call 9-1-1!
Ohh! Oh, my God.
I don't believe it.
Aah.
9-1-1 emergency.
How long did they say
it was gonna be?
The phone's dead, man.
There's no service in this
shithole part of town!
Okay, we gotta get him
to an emergency room.
Oh, how do you
work this, Ray?
I didn't see him, man.
He came out of nowhere.
...
Hey! Bring him
into the RV!
Come on.
All right.
Okay. All right.
I got ya.
Is he okay?
Hear me out.
Let's figure this thing out.
Move, Ray!
Move!
Aah!
Easy, easy, easy!
Careful, careful!
All right,
easy, easy, easy.
Easy, easy.
Aah!
Be careful,
be careful.
Ray, get a towel.
-
-
Put this under his head!
Be careful. Easy, easy.
Ohh!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- It's all right.
He's a thief, man.
The cops probably shot him.
They'll be back any minute.
- What happened, kid? Who shot you?
- Hey, leave him alone.
Goddamn it, somebody shot him!
We could all be in danger!
- We're not gonna leave him.
- Look, I've had a lot
to drink tonight, okay?
Hey, man, what's your problem?
The kid is hurt.
You want me to go to prison
because of this punk?
It is not our concern.
Yes, it is, Ray.
They're coming after me.
You gotta help me.
We won't let anybody hurt you.
- You gotta get me outta here!
- Shut up, goddamn it!
I can't hear myself think!
Who the hell are you
tellin' to shut up?
No, wait!
Listen.
- There they go, right there!
-
We gotta catch 'em!
Look, we should get
our stories straight.
If you're not gonna drive,
I will.
Get out of the way!
There they go!
Hey, help, police! Help!
We got somebody shot!
They turned the corner!
Hey!
Frank!
Frank, take it easy
Shit.
Where the hell are they?
Where did they go?
-
- Whoa!
Ohhh!
Ray? Huh?
Yeah, I think so.
Aah!
Ahh!
What the hell hit us?
My guess?
Probably some no-insurance...
Un-fuckin'-believable!
- Ray, calm down.
- Calm down?
This stuff's
gonna cost me a fortune.
I'm now the proud owner of
a nice little fax machine.
Gonna fax myself.
Might be nice for me later.
- This'll be mine. All right. Okay.
- You okay, brother?
Uh.
We're stuck in here.
We're stuck, okay?
We're stuck in this piece of shit
which I now own, okay?
This piece of fuckin' shit!
Ray, Ray!
- Ray! Ray!
- Calm down!
Hey, Ray, why don't you
try and start this thing?
Fuck, get a window open
or somethin'.
It's dead.
We're not goin' anywhere.
- They're out there.
-
You guys don't know
what you're messin' with.
We gotta get outta here!
We gotta get ou...
Shut up! We're doing
the best we can, all right?
All right, quiet!
I'm gonna
take a look around.
No, don't do that.
They'll blow your head off.
Ray, get the gun.
It's gone.
What?
It fell out when we hit.
It's gotta be here.
Try and find it.
Nothing.
Seems okay.
I think we can all
squeeze through there...
What up, Teddy?
Playin' a little hide-and-seek?
Come here, motherfucker!
Back the fuck off!
No!
- Ladies.
- No! Come on, man!
You wanna get tough with me, kid?
You wanna keep 'em, huh?
Back off, kid.
You ain't got no balls.
Now, you children sit tight
and no one'll get hurt, okay?
Crack a window.
You okay?
The thing isn't working?
I thought you said
there was no service.
Look...
Sykes, look, no.
You know...
Shh.
This is crazy.
Sykes, you know me.
It's not like that, man.
I didn't do anything.
All you gotta do is tell Fallon,
that's all I'm askin'!
- Tell Fallon what?
- Well, go ahead, tell him.
Look, it's not
what you think, man.
L-I wasn't running, man.
You got it wrong. Look.
I got all the money right there!
You... You can count it.
How could you steal
from me, Teddy?
L-I wasn't stealin' from you.
It's right there. All the money, man!
Only thing I hate worse than
a thief is a liar, Teddy.
You broke rule number one:
Do not steal from me.
What you thinkin' about,
Teddy?
- Come on, we grew up, man.
- All you had to do was keep
the merchandise movin', Teddy.
What was the problem?
No company car?
Not long enough lunches?
- We're not gonna do anything!
Not one fucking thing!
- Shh! Come on!
What? What do you
want us to do, man?
Did you mention my name
to the guys in the truck?
I didn't say anything!
Why the fuck would I say anything?
I wouldn't rat you out, man!
So what do you want me to do?
You want me to let you go?
- Then I'm supposed to conduct
business on the street.
- Who's gonna know, right?
- He's not gonna tell 'em,
I'm not gonna tell 'em.
- That's right.
- No, man, all you gotta do is...
-
You know,
we got another problem.
How many guys
in the truck?
About four.
North Shore plates too.
Great. Just great.
Well, boys, rule number two:
No witnesses.
Come on!
-
- Come on, John,
or you're gonna be next!
-
- Fuck.
- What the hell are you doing?
-
- Aw, shit!
- What?
-
- Where do these guys
think they're goin'?
-
Come on, Ray!
Come on, buddy!
Shit!
Oh! Sorry, man!
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.
Thanks. That's what
I'll tell the dealer.
You won't be telling
the dealer nothin' unless
we get the fuck outta here!
That's not funny.
Hey, man,  was funny!
Shit looks like the  man.
Let's go!
Let's go, Ray!
Stop!
Where are we headed?
John,
are you all right?
They killed him.
I don't think they're
gonna follow us, man.
They won't do that.
We saw him shoot that kid, Ray.
We were witnesses.
Where the hell are we,
huh?
Why'd you get off
the expressway, Ray?
Are we at
the blaming stage now?
I don't remember
twisting your arm
to get off the expressway.
Go! Go!
Hey!
Forget it, Mike!
Come on!
Come on, Mike!
Ohh!
Did they see us?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
- They do want to kill us.
- I never said they wanted to kill us!
- What are we gonna do?
- Shut up!
Well!
- Look what the cat drug in.
-
What do you think
of the neighborhood?
Call these "condos"
down here.
And by the way,
you fucked up my car...
and I don't have collision.
bodily harm or somethin'.
I'm a college graduate.
He's got the brain
of a chicken.
if he was to hear you
in... here, oop!
Shh! Shh!
They'd... They'd shoot us
and then blow your heads off.
I don't think so.
Might even be grateful.
Might give us a reward.
All right.
All right, goddamn it.
Uh, well, gee,
Mr. Businessman,
What did you have
in mind?
-
-
Don't even breathe.
Don't you hate it...
when you're tryin'
to be quiet...
and every sound...
seems to be amplified...
What's that smell?
You guys wearing cologne,
or is that... fear?
Nice watch.
Go to hell.
Already there, man.
Ray, give it to him.
You got some
'splaining to do!
Don't touch me!
Don't be stupid, John.
All right.
That's all I got.
You guys are really
startin' to piss me off!
This is eatin'
into my drinkin' time.
But I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do; since
I'm such a nice person...
and so in touch
with my inner child...
two Mississippi.
All right!
Opportunity knocked,
and you failed to answer!
Don't say I didn't
give you a chance!
All right!
This one's
locked up too, man.
It's possible they
didn't even stop here,
they just took right off.
It just doesn't
feel right, you know?
I'm a college graduate.
Ain't got my jacket
no more.
That's too bad.
Somebody stole it.
...
I mean,
you shoulda seen me!
"Go up high, Buck!"
Buck!
Take it easy!
Shh! Shh!
What are you doin'?
I'd go out wide, man!
I could've been Walter Payton!
Sure you could.
This guy played too many
games without a helmet.
You think I'm funny
or somethin', man?
Who do you think you are...
wearing that jacket
and callin' me a liar?
Shh!
'Cause I'm a goddamn
college graduate!
What the hell do I gotta do
to shut him up?
Come on, let's get out!
Come on, man, move it!
Take out time, boys!
Let's go!
When's the last time they
ever won anything anyways?
Hmm, plastic.
Hmm. Bums must've
rolled 'em, huh?
Welcome to
the neighborhood, boys.
Come on,
we can outrun them.
Come on, come on,
come on!
Hold it! Shh!
John! John!
Get up! Let's go!
Frank, listen, I can't
fuckin' keep up, okay?
You have to!
Don't leave my ass down here.
This is hell.
You can do this, man.
You take care of me, I'll
give you anything you want.
All I want...
is for you
to move your ass.
We're gonna make it,
all of us.
Okay.
Okay? Now,
I think we lost 'em.
All right.
Yeah,
I'm all right.
Where are the cops?
Someone must've
heard the blasts.
You could dynamite a whole
city block, they wouldn't come.
It's criminal.
Look at this.
Great. Hey, wait,
there's lights on in
that building up there.
Let's go get some help.
Come on.
Come on!
I'd be worryin' about my ass,
not my jacket!
Yeah, well, my ass
doesn't cost 450 bucks!
If anything happens, don't
think, just run. Okay?
Gotta find someone who'll
let us use their phone.
You really think one of
these freaks is gonna
let us use their phone?
"These freaks"
are our neighbors, Ray.
They're not
my neighbors, man.
Oh, yeah?
I bet we haven't been more
than ten miles from your
front door this whole night.
What's up with that noise?
-
- No, no, no.
I got a better idea.
Mike!
There's a way in
over there.
Hi, sir.
I need to use your phone.
No! No, no!
No way!
Just one phone call!
Thanks a lot!
Mike, take it easy, man.
You too, buddy!
Hello, anybody home?
What's wrong
with these people?
They're just like you.
How is that?
They're scared.
They won't even
talk to us.
Hi.
May we use your phone?
Hey, hey!
Get behind the door!
Nobody's gonna help us.
Nobody.
Welcome to
the real world, Ray.
This is it!
If you say that to me again,
I'm gonna kill you, I swear I will.
Hello. Hello?
Anybody in there?
Please open the door
if you're there. Hello.
Come on, please!
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't wanna scare her off.
Excuse me.
I need to use a phone.
Just hold it right there.
Now keep back.
Keep back!
Please, just listen...
'Cause I'll bust all
your goddamned heads,
and don't think I won't!
Clarissa, you all right?
Get out of here, Rita!
Just give us a chance...
is to get your
motherfuckin' asses in gear
before I start swingin'!
- I told you these people
didn't want to help us.
-
We saw a boy murdered tonight.
The men that shot him did it in
cold blood, and if they catch us...
- they're gonna kill us too.
- So they're following you?
- No, no, we lost them.
-
We just
wanna use your phone
to call the police.
That's it. We're not
gonna cause you any trouble.
Please.
Sykes, this is bullshit.
We lost 'em, man!
We're just wastin' our time.
You know something?
You are really beginning
to piss me off!
Where he goes, we go.
Now shut the fuck up!
Yo! Hey, what's up?
Yo, man, these the punks
you saw, man?
No, they ain't the ones.
You punks crazy
or somethin', man?
Chill out, man.
-
- He lookin' for some citizens.
This is our block.
If you got any brains...
- We got business, that's all.
- Oh, you got some business, man?
What kind
of business you got?
Wait a minute, right?
I've had about enough
of this bullshit.
I'm gonna ventilate
your little cranium.
What about that, huh?
-
- I got some too, man.
Just, uh, a little bit
too much meat today.
That's all, man.
What you smilin' at?
I understand, man.
I respect ya.
You're taking care
of your block. That's great.
But these motherfuckers ripped me off.
That can't happen.
Know what I mean?
You know.
I don't know.
If I fuck with you now, you look
like shit in front of your boys.
How much is this gonna cost?
Man, if I want your money,
I'll take it.
No, you can't take my money...
but you  take my money.
- Go ahead.
- Money got blood on it, man.
You ever seen any
that didn't?
Now, go ask Webster
over there...
- which building those people
went into, okay?
-
I don't believe this.
Ray, you're wearin' a hole
in the carpet, bro.
Down here people die of old age
waiting for the cops.
No goddamn way.
This is bullshit.
Watch this.
I'll get their asses over here
in one goddamn second.
What's wrong, Ray?
The phone's dead.
What do you mean,
it's dead?
Give me.
It must be them.
They're here!
Maybe you didn't
pay your phone bill.
- Oh, yeah, right!
- Hey, shut up, Ray!
"Francis...
"Howard...
Wyatt."
Used to have a girlfriend
named Frances.
- How does he know my name?
- Frank, beautiful baby!
Wow! Lucky for you she looks
just like your wife, huh?
What's your wife, Italian?
I always wanted to fuck
an Italian girl, Frank.
I tell you what, Frankie... Francis.
Since you won't meet me man-to-man...
I'm gonna take my case
to the people, all right?
Get the fuck outta my house.
Go on.
Honey, come here.
-
- Get the hell out of my house!
There's nothin'
on three floors.
We got two more to go.
It's okay. Everything's
gonna be all right.
- We can't stay here.
- If we go out there,
they're gonna kill us.
-
- These people put their lives
on the line for us!
-
- Yeah, go!
Let's do it.
No way!
I'm not going out there!
-
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus, Ray.
- I'm not goin' anywhere.
-
- You had that thing the whole time?
- Why the hell didn't you
use it when we needed it?
- Shh! I'm using it now!
On us.
Yeah.
- Whichever one thinks you're
gonna get me through that door.
- What are you doing?
The cops'll be here
any second.
Let's wait
till they get here.
- The cops are not coming!
- Yes, they are.
Stay right back, okay?
I am not gonna die down here.
-
- These people weren't involved,
and they helped us.
If those bastards find us here,
they're gonna kill everybody.
You gotta trust me, man.
You don't want this deal.
Come on, Razor.
Give me the gun!
-
-
Go to the roof; the kids
have a way of getting across
to the next building.
It's the only chance
you have.
Thanks a lot.
Gimme your gun.
Gimme your gun!
Here.
Here, use this.
Knock, knock, faggot.
Open the door.
Hey, take it easy, man.
Fuck.
I found it!
Jesus,
that's the escape route?
Let's do it.
Kids do this.
Let's go, Ray.
- Ray?
- I can't.
The pipe, Ray.
Use the pipe.
What the fuck am I doing?
Just slide down.
Ray, whatever you do,
don't look down.
Thanks, pal.
I wasn't going to.
Funny, Frank. I'm glad
you save your best material
for the rooftop show.
That's good,
that's good.
When I get down, I'm gonna
kick your fuckin' ass.
- John, get your ass
across that ladder now.
- What are you guys doin'?
Let's go, Ray.
All right, John, come on, buddy.
Don't look down, look at me!
Okay, that's it. You know,
like the 40 yard line, man.
That's it. All right. Next.
Go ahead.
I wanna follow you. You go first.
You're full of crap, Ray.
Climbing across this thing
is not gonna kill you.
Those guys are!
Come on,
I swear to God.
I can always tell when you're
full of crap, Ray, and you are
full of crap right now!
Don't make me leave you up here.
Don't do that to me!
Look, I said I would do it!
You want me to put it
in writing?
I will follow you.
All right, let's do it.
Come on.
Watch how simple this is.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Come on, Frank!
- Move it!
- Come on, Frank!
Motherfucker!
-
- There!
I don't believe
these guys got guns.
Yeah, too easy these days.
Go ahead, check it out.
Frank!
Nice move.
Come on, Frank, come on,
buddy, come on.
Give me your hand.
Come on!
Come on, Frank!
I got you. I got you.
Come on, come on. Okay.
Ray!
What are you doin'?
I ain't no acrobat.
I'm gonna negotiate with these guys.
What with, Ray?
I got these guys
right where I want 'em.
- Frank, come on!
- I'm the Razorman, remember?
- Let's go.
- Come on.
Easy, fellas.
Hear me out a second. Just
give me a chance to talk, okay?
What do you wanna talk about?
Something near and dear
to my heart... money.
Money. Money's good.
Yeah.
Money makes
the world go 'round.
And if I don't?
Start talking.
There's no reason for any
of this to be happening.
Whatever happened to that kid,
I'm sure he deserved it.
That's your business.
That's  business.
Nobody's going to the police.
All we want to do is get home.
Home. Home is where
the heart is, right?
Correct me if I'm wrong here,
but, uh... didn't you say
somethin' about money?
Yeah, I did.
How about $100,000 cash?
You can raise
that kind of money? Wow.
Yes, I can.
Let me ask you somethin'.
Those shoes, what are those,
Italian?
-
-
Yeah, they're actually
Italian running shoes.
Actually kinda working well
for me this evening.
Yeah? And your dad's what,
he's a, uh, a stockbroker?
Somethin' like that.
But I'm a self-made guy.
I'm a self-starter.
Just like you.
That's funny. 'Cause these guys
are always sayin' that to me.
That's why we hang
with him.
Self-made man.
Hmm.
This, this is a beautiful ring.
Rhodes, take a look at this.
Oh, that's beautiful, man.
Take this home to your girl.
Tell me something, how much
is a ring like that worth?
Retail, that's 15 K.
But for you guys,
Hmm.
Call it a down payment,
under the table.
You know, I think, uh,
I think we can cut a deal here.
Oh, man,
that's beautiful.
Yeah.
I can't believe this.
He's doin' it.
You're pretty good.
Wh-What's your name?
Ray. Ray, yeah.
You're a good negotiator.
You didn't even lowball me.
I'm gonna come in here
and lowball you?
Forget about that.
Well, the thing is, I gotta trust you.
There's the payment of money...
Now hold on.
We're businessmen, both of us.
We have an understanding.
Oh.
Let me tell you somethin',
uh, Ray.
You don't understand shit.
Okay? Nothing.
You and your friends are
the kind of spoon-fed fuckin'
fruit bait that I fuckin' hate!
I don't think
you understood me.
Shut the fuck up! You speak
when fuckin' spoken to, okay?
This is not fuckin'
high school, motherfucker!
You just sail through life
reading about people like me
in the newspaper. Hey!
Yeah, $100,000 might
buy you out in North Shore.
Down here that means shit!
This is my fuckin' world!
Two hundred thousand.
All right.
Yeah.
This... You had...
You schooled me.
Ray. Ray.
God.
Ray.
I'm gettin' off this roof
in one piece.
- No!
-
- Motherfucker!
- Jesus.
-
- It's all right.
No! Let me go, Frank!
Okay, Frank, wait! Okay!
Come on, John, let's go!
Don't look at him, John.
Come on, he's gone, man!
Come on. Come on.
All right.
Frank.
Shh.
We should've done something.
Makes no sense for Ray
to go out like that.
Nothing about tonight
makes much sense.
I keep hearing him
screaming.
Well, well, well, it's
our little chicken-shits.
Go! Go!
No!
Get off!
- Frank!
- Get down, get down!
Aaah! Go, go, go!
Aaah!
John.
Split up.
Man, this is stupid.
You really think we're
gonna catch these guys?
Yeah.
You comin'?
Watch your ass.
Shit.
I always do, Mom.
Oh, shit!
These guys don't give up.
They're right on our ass.
We gotta get outta here.
It's hard to tell
where they're coming from.
We don't wanna run into them.
What are we gonna do?
We gotta make a stand.
I always wondered how I'd do
in combat. Could I cut it?
You ever wonder
about that, Frank?
- Guess I'm about to find out.
-
- Mike, they got guns.
We have nothing!
- Screw the guns.
If we watch each other's back,
we'll be... we'll be okay.
Right? Huh?
- There you go, Johnny boy.
- Let's do it.
Hey, Frank...
let's show these punks
what we got.
Right.
Okay, let's go! Go!
You guys down there?
I got your back.
Frank! Frank!
- Yaah!
-
Where're you guys at?
- Hey, don't you move. Don't you move.
-
All right, who's
the chicken-shit now, huh?
You gonna shoot me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You ever shoot anybody before?
I don't think so.
Now, if you don't
give me that back...
the same thing that happened
to your friend Ray
is gonna happen to you. Oh!
- Ohh!
-
Man, did you see
the look on his face?
He didn't think
I could do it.
Let's move.
No, screw that! Hey,
I say we stay down here
and we finish 'em.
What is the matter
with you, huh?
This isn't a goddamn game!
John, let's go.
...
Hey! Hey, I thought
you had my back!
Hey, John,
I'm talkin' to you!
We gotta find some cover.
What the hell happened
to you down there?
Um...
Huh?
I'm sorry.
Sorry doesn't cut it.
You almost got me killed!
Hey! Back off, Mike.
Your baby brother fucked up.
He better not do it again!
Oh, yeah? Or what?
See, that's the Frank
I used to know.
You better believe it.
Now let's get off the street.
Yes, sir, boss.
This is great.
You know,
I don't know about you guys,
but I didn't sign on for this.
You mean, you'd let these guys
get away with this, right?
...
You know what I hate?
I hate whiners, you know.
I hate people who just
complain, complain, complain.
Had a guy in the joint one time,
cell next to me, you know.
He used to yap about everything.
Used to yap about the food,
yap about the guards.
And yap about this, and yap about
that, and yap, yap, yap all night long.
Fuckin' yap, yap, yap, like
a fuckin' 747. You know what I mean?
Like an engine stuck right between your
ears and you can't get away from it.
I don't think
he's gettin' up.
It's gone now.
Oh, damn it.
If those assholes were
here right now, I'd, I'd...
I'd...
probably just freeze.
I tried, you know.
John, you gotta
keep it together, man.
Keep it together?
Fuck you, Frank!
I'm scared.
I'm really scared.
And I don't think
I'm gonna make it through
this fuckin' night.
John. Come here, come here.
No, Frank, no.
Everybody gets scared.
No.
Whether they admit it or not.
I'm scared too.
Look at me.
I'm cryin'
like a baby here.
Thanks... for stickin' up
for me back there.
Yeah, well,
Mike's as scared as we are.
Hey.
There's... nobody
out on the street.
So what do you think,
boss?
Why don't you cool it
on that "boss" stuff?
Hey! Hey, yo!
Wait! Wait!
Hey!
Hey, we're here!
Hey, stop!
Look, hey...
What are you doin'?
Hey! Hey!
I don't think so.
Hey, come on!
Come back, you bitch!
Come back. Come back!
Is that what this is about?
Balls? What about using
your goddamn brain?
Watch what you say to me!
What are you tryin'
to prove, Mike?
That you can get us killed?
Because that's exactly
what you're gonna do!
I got a wife and a little girl,
and I will get back to them!
You wanna go out
like a goddamn hero?
Then you do it alone.
Let's go, John.
Frank! Frank!
What, goddamn it?
Just wait up.
No?
Maybe there's
another way in.
It's kinda dark.
I don't see anything.
There's gotta be
a security guard on duty.
Well, let's try and, uh,
wake him up!
Hello?
We're in trouble now.
-
- Hey, concierge, I need a room!
Hell of a security system.
Excellent response time.
Hey!
Yo!
Anyone home?
Hello? Anybody here?
We're here to rob the place.
Anybody got a problem
with that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I said freeze!
Now, put your hands on top
of the counter and spread 'em!
Do it!
Well, anything you say.
All right,
we're freezin'.
Yeah, we're freezin' and we're
spreadin'. Anything else
you want us to do?
You frisk 'em.
I'll call 5-O.
Uh-oh, they're callin' the cops.
Hey, that's 9-1-1, buddy.
Tell 'em to haul their ass.
These kids are loaded.
Let's get to work.
Listen, man, the reason...
These guys
have been after us...
Look!
You tell it to the cops.
They get paid to listen
to your bullshit stories.
Hey, watch it.
Careful, I'm ticklish.
Uh, uh, mister,
there's one thing l...
No!
Put your hands back up
on the cooler!
Put 'em up on the cooler!
You understand me?
- Don't make a move!
- Okay.
in the frozen foods
department tonight: Dead meat.
Plump, juicy and fresh
from our North Shore farm.
Shop 'til you drop,
right, Frank?
Get back on that cooler!
Get on there! Hey, get on there!
This guy's not our friend.
Motherfucker!
Hey, Mike. Mike!
Come on.
You go on.
Damn.
- Mike?
- You go on.
No way.
I'm gonna deal with these guys.
I'm gonna handle this.
Would you cut
this heroics crap? And let's go!
Frank!
You got a family.
Me, all I got is you.
Stay there.
Mike?
Hey, Frank!
-
-
- Why don't you come out
and get your friend?
-
Shh!
Oh, man.
Through good or bad
or happy or sad
Oh, it's all right
with me
Jesus.
Jesus, Mike!
John. Oh!
You guys are unbelievable.
Get up. Get up!
I was there
and I don't even believe it.
Come on, let's go.
Let's move. Let's go!
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, this way.
I'm okay, I'm okay. Uhh!
Come on.
All right.
Mike, you're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna go get help.
John's gonna stay
here with you.
Yes, sir, boss.
Come on.
Easy, easy.
Put your hand here
and keep it there, all right?
You all right?
Yeah.
Right.
Come on, Frank!
Scumbag!
Come on, Frank!
I'm gonna kill your two fuckin'
pussy friends and then
I'm gonna kill you, all right?
You look fucked up.
At least I can walk.
-
-
Hey, you fuckin' scumbag!
I'm out here!
I said I'm out here,
you piece of shit!
You know, Frank,
after I kill you...
I think I'm gonna pay a little
visit on that wife of yours.
What did you say you were
gonna do to my wife?
What's the matter, asshole?
Why so quiet all of a sudden?
Aaah!
You fuckin' dog!
Ow! Ohh!
Uhh! Oh!
Look at me
when I'm talkin' to you.
Hey!
You think you hurt me tonight,
is that it, huh?
Is that what you think,
Francis? Answer me!
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
Fuckin' prick!
Get up!
This how you're
gonna go out?
Francis.
Ohh!
You're not gettin' away...
'cause I know
where you're goin'.
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
I don't think so, pal.
"1922 Deadwood Drive."
That's a fuckin' riot.
Deadwood Drive.
Bet you got a nice house
up there, huh, Frank?
Hmm? Can't wait to meet
your daughter. What's her name again?
Ah, it doesn't matter.
You'll never see her grow up anyways.
No more!
I knew you'd do
the right thing.
Come on, Francis.
You're comin' with me.
No!
Nooo!
Come on, Francis.
You're on your own, pal.
And don't call me Francis.
Stay where you are!
Everything's all right!
It's over.
Hello?
This is an emergency.
I need help. I need...
Sir? Are you still there?
Sir?
Look, my brother and my friend
are bleedin' to death upstairs.
Get down on the floor.
You're not listening to me!
Down!
I don't fuckin'
believe this.
Hey, Al, he's tellin'
the truth. It's like
a battleground out here.
Come on.
Don't worry,
you're gonna be fine.
Excuse me. How is he?
He's lost a lot of blood,
but his vital signs are good.
Take it easy.
Take it easy, man.
Take it easy.
Hey, buddy, they say
you're gonna be okay.
I better... I better be.
I got tickets to
the Bears game next week.
Well, you have a good time.
Wait. I got seats
on the 50 yard line.
Listen, I'm gonna be home
with Linda and the baby
watchin' the game on TV.
You... You're a wimp.
Hey, John.
Yeah?
Mike got you tickets
to the Bears game.
No, thanks, Frank.
I'm too young
for this shit.
I'll see you
at the hospital, bro.
You must've dropped it.
Hey, Makowski, on the double!
All right, here we go.
