Yo, dawg.
Konichiwa.
- What?
- Konichiwa.
Konichiwa means:
"What's up?"
- So what the fuck's up?
- We know what it means.
You wanna smoke?
Read the paper??? yourself clean.
Couple of these and you'll be
fucking like beasts.
- Boys like pussy, right?
- Hey!
Yo, do we look like fucking
tweakers  to you?
- So you got the shit or not?
Yeah. You?
What the fuck is this?
We said a machine gun.
It is a machine gun.
- The kind you can carry.
- Couldn't get none of those.
This baby's got character,
Korean war vintage.
Maybe we mowed down
one of your grand-papa sans,
when he was charging the wire
in China.???
Shit, it's fuckin' stuck.
Fuck it! Take it right. 3 large,
.
Nigger, I drive a $100,000 car.
We want your fagotty ass right
or we'll jack  it from you.
Cool. Down to insult right now.
Konichiwa is Japanese.
It's insulting to Koreans.
How am I supposed to tell
if you can't?
'fuck's that supposed
to mean, white boy?
Means you got eyes like apostrophes,
you dress white, you talk black,
and drive dukes?? .
So how am I supposed to know
what kind of zipperhead
dog-munching thing you are,
if you don't
Yo.
You know what the fuck we are?
Yes, you're a couple of
panheads ...
buyin' a machine gun out of a trunk.
What's up?
- Take him up.
- Get your ass up!
Shit.
What do you mean, shit?!
- Konichiwa, bitch.
- Let's go.
Where?
* Missing
Call Missing Children Hotline
It' okay.
I'm a cop.
Captain Wander, congratulations on
breaking the case.
Can you tell me how
you've found the twins?
Truly, my people turned this city
upside down, looking for these girls.
I could not be prouder of my men.
Ma'am, excuse me.
How can you shoot a guy
taking a dump?
I mean, seriously, that's sacred.
That's like shooting
the man in a church.
Or a Dodger game.
Whatever it takes to be a hero,
any time, any place, right, Lud?
I guess so...
I hate these slit-eyed
kiddy-raping bastards.
At least kidnap some full-grown
ladies with shapes.
Wow. Maybe we should check his
closet next, eh, Lud?
The girls are being examined by
a physician right now.
Both twins are in good health
and will be reunited
with their family shortly.
L.A. Times front page tomorrow
is gonna say:
"Vice detective rescues missing twins."
Detective.
Singular.
Yeah, maybe we've been sittin'
around on our asses and doin' jack shit
- and all during the last month.
- Hey!
You two cut the shit.
The boss is on his way right now.
I mean, you could've
just saved some for us.
, Santos?
You wanna see their faces every night?
You wanna be a killer?
You know what? Shut the fuck up!
Hey, what the hell is going on?
Hey!
This is real professional.
What if I walk in here
with the chief? Huh?
Santos, go get your ass outside.
Find Ted Berman and make sure
that that crime scene lot
is in order.
- Yes, sir.
- Ride along, boy.
- Shut the fuck up.
- Hey, secure that bullshit, right?
Both of you.
Clady, you take DeMille back
to the ward and start writing.
I want something to red-pin by midnight.
- Tell your buddy he's
gonna do his writing.
Got it captain. Let's go.
This is crazy.
You fucked 'em up.
This is beautiful.
And that machine gun shit,
that was perfect.
I know you hate to wait,
but it's better this way.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- I got shot.
- Yeah, but you're okay?
Yeah. I'm okay, Jack.
Because I know you're not tripping
about these...these assholes, right?
Fuck, it's cool.
You were toe to toe with evil,
and you won.
You saved those girls.
This is lovely, Tommy.
Come here, man.
Give me a hug.
Come on.
Not so tight.
What are you hiding from?
You've been drinking.
You know, that thing
they say about vodka?
That you can't smell it?
It's bullshit.
The D.A. ...
shooting team is in rut
right now .
And your're not ready
for public consumption.
So...come on, I wanna
get you to a hospital.
Get you away from all of this.
Thanks, Jack.
If that aint L.A.'s deadliest white boy.
Aren't you on the wrong side
of the yellow tape?
Congrats on four more notches
for your gun butt.
I'll be praying for
the families of your victims.
They're called "suspects."
The victims are the
the suspects kept in a cage
and sold to chicken hawks
to poke prod
put on the Internet.
"Suspects," Washington.
"Suspects."
As evil as those men were,
they had a right to trial.
There is gonna be some
blowback ...
from the Korean community on this one.
Now that you're off limits,
why don't you just say it?
You think I'm a racist.
- Do you have another explanation?
- No, I don't,
because if I rule and
determine a suspect...
is black, yellow or brown
I blow them out of their socks.
But if they are white,
I give them a ride home.
You know why?
Because I am a racist. Fuck you.
Man, I would give you my right arm
to have that shit on tape.
What happened to you, Terrence?
We used to be brothers.
Hey, hey!
Stay on point, Washington.
You stay on point .
Always, Captain Wander.
Always.
Tom. Come on,
let's get you out of here.
Don't go near that piece of shit.
He's got it coming, Jack.
Do not go near him.
Stay away, far away.
- Fuck him.
- That's an order.
I'm waiting for Nurse Garcia.
I did the same thing
with this girl once.
She was a waitress at a jazz bar.
I'd sit in her section and
won't let anybody else serve me.
If they changed sections,
I'd change tables.
Persistence, that's the key.
Wait a second.
You're that cop. You're that--
I've just seen your face on tv.
You rescued those
Korean twins, right?
Are you okay?
Did you get shot?
No.
Yeah.
How about you?
Me? I sell insurance.
Life, auto, casualty.
That was some heavy shit, man.
So those guys, they shot first, right?
Excuse me?
The whole city was looking
for those kids.
- How'd you find them?
- That's my job.
Excuse me, Captain.
Sorry to interrupt.
Deputy Chief??? is trying to raise you
on the simplex .
Insurance, Tom.
I sell insurance.
If you ever need any,
and you will,
why don't you give me a call?
No one has to know but us.
Not Clady, not Wander, no one.
CAPTAIN JAMES BIGGS.
Listen, for your own good...
Don't get yourself so far out there
that I can't reel you back.
See you sometime.
Who was that?
Copper??? cops.
Jesus.
- Who?
- Nobody, Grace.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hold this.
You know, you can just
stop by sometime.
You don't have to get shot
when you want to see me.
Why? I like it like this.
Don't you?
No, I don't.
I don't.
No.????
I work here. I'm not losing
my license for you.
- I am a cop.
- No.
I keep the door open after
identifying myself as a police officer.
Upon entry, I was fired upon
by a suspect in the living room
with a silver automatic.
I returned fire,
he goes down.
Then I'm hit in the torso by shotgun
fire from the second suspect.
Point of entry?
Front door in the
west side of the structure.
Why didn't you call
for backup?
Exigent  circumstances.
I heard screams
emanating from the house,
and assertained a crime was in progress.
Great work you did there.
Thanks a lot.
Now it's a party.
Oh my goodness, now it's
a bandage???, captain.
How you doin'?
Steady, steady.
Yeah, he's in.
What's with you?
Clady give you a 'happy ending'?
Is that any way to address a commander?
Got the call from the
chief this morning.
is next week.
Congratulations, boss.
We're gonna have the keys to the city.
Do you believe that shit?
They're crowning him king.
Let's get a toast to that.
Toast to the king.
King Wander.
Yo boss, gotta be your driver
when you make chief?
- You got it, you got it if you want.
- All right.
You know, I owe you one, Tom.
That pot twins caper,
that gave me the edge.
You know, the chief,
he's breaking tradition.
????
The first commander's slot?? always goes
to the head of Internal Affairs,
that's the way it is.
That's because they got
so much dirt on everyone.
That's right,
and they're always
looking for more, huh?
Yeah.
You know this prick?
Came at me like "Joe Concerned Citizen"
asking procedural questions.
Yeah, we got a history, this--
See, if they'd show up
during the daytime,
you would know who your enemies are.
What did you tell him?
I couldn't help myself clearly,
I told him everything.
Attaboy.
You know, this is a typical
Biggs bullshit move,
???
Backdoor is all they fuckin' got.
Why is Internal Affairs
after my ass all of a sudden?
It's Washington, brother.
Your ex-partner is a snitch.
Holy shit.
Jack, talk to me.
Washington has had several meetings...
with Captain Biggs over
the last few weeks.
They're no secrets in the department,
so when I became cognizant
of the problem, we threw a tail on him,
I followed this guy,
Eastside, Westside, Southside.
Next thing I know, he's ringing Biggs'
doorbell in??? land.
Who's Washington given up?
You, Tom.
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Why now?
- Because I shitcanned
him from this unit
and he is a vindictive bastard.
And now he is on a mission
to pull the??? from under my best guys.
All my best guys,
that's what this shit's about.
Tommy, Tommy.
- That's your life right there.
- I'm just gonna talk to my friend.
- No, you 're not. You're not.
- You wanna talk?
Let's talk about my foot up your ass
if you don't sit the fuck down
here on your chair right now.
Have a seat.
Come on.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Do not, and I repeat, do not
hand Washington your badge.
I know you two have done some
???  together,
But we gotta hold the line,
you and me.
We've been here before, haven't we?
When the gates of hell
opened up on you, Tom.
I took care of you then,
I'm gonna take care of you now.
- All right?
- Okay.
Washington.
Drop it.
- What are you doing?
Do you want to kill me, partner?
Are you crazy, we've
got a 211 in park rest???.
I got you.
I got you and Wander.
Listen to me, you idiot. We've got two
gang bangers rolling in hot.
Shit.
Washington.
Stay with me, partner.
- Don't move! Let me see your hands!
- I'm a cop...
I'm a cop,
I'm a fucking cop!
Fuck.
- It's Ludlow.
- Give me an ambulance now.
Holy shit.
He's a cop too?
Yeah.
Where's the video?
- Who else has seen this?
- Just us, boss.
It was a straight 211 that went south.
That's not what it was,
that's what it looks like.
But it's not what it looks like.
It's not.
That's all there is, Tom.
What it looks like.
What everybody sees.
You knew that.
Right, if anybody in the
department sees this video,
you're no longer a cop,
do you understand that?
The department?
If the D.A. sees this...
- he's going to prison.
- Why?
Because Washington was
in the wrong place at the wrong time?
No, because you were.
Washington's problems are over.
Yours are just beginning.
Try to think
two moves ahead, for once.
Captain Biggs will say that you got
two thugs  off the street
went after a cop who
was diming  you out
to Internal Affairs.
It writes itself.
I was just gonna break his jaw.
- That's a good answer.
I gave you a direct order:
Stay away from him.
Give me your goddamn gun.
Now.
Give me your goddamn gun.
You don't give a shit about yourself,
that's pretty obvious,
but you gotta think about the unit.
You really fucked us on this one.
Clady, give me a minute, please.
Yes, sir.
I can't afford to lose you.
Who would do what you do?
You are the tip of the fucking spear.
Who's gonna hold back the animals?
Maybe...
the clerk...
forget to put a disk
in the recorder today.
Maybe you were first on the scene, Tom.
And you ran to the aid to Washington.
Who wanna say...
Make some calls.
And me...
this shit won't be here
when I get back.
He was my partner, back in the day.
We were black and white...
when black and white
was still a big deal.
White cops wouldn't back us
'cause of him,
black cops because of me.
Fuck 'em.
We made it.
Sorry. You tried to save him,
you did your best.
My best? I was curled up
in a ball  while he got shot.
We should have dumped those guys.
They just wave a pen and
change what happened.
Just like that.
We're the police,
we can do whatever the hell we want.
It doesn't matter what happens.
It's how we write it up.
What about the truth?
What about it?
You have to honor him,
your friend.
Honor him?
I was gonna knock him out
and he thought I was gonna kill him.
- Prick.
- Don't turn your back on him.
Good can come from bad.
In my world, the real world...
bad breeds more bad, Grace.
You see this? It's done. It's over.
It's????
All right?
I don't want to give you
another dose here, but
Got a set of blues
still in your locker?
- No...
- Here's the thing.
- I gotta bury you.
- Not that.
In a nice politically correct spot.
Until this Washington
thing's cooled off a bit.
No, Jack.
You work is to conduct preliminary
interviews of the
If there is a specific allegation
against an officer
you write it up and forward
it over to Internal Affairs.
Now, temptation is to be a good
brother cop.
Don't be. Noe of this shit's
going anywhere anyway.
There is your desk.
Suppose I get a complaint
against myself?
Write it up and forward it.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Do you have a complaint?
Motherfucker beat my ass
like I was Rodney King, man.
Except there wasn't no video.
Dude looked just like you,
but black.
This ass been working longer than
all the y'all cops disrespecting me.
He pulled me out of my
ride, disrespected...
me in front of my old lady.
Tried to get her number and shit.
Do you have his badge number?
Did you see his name tag?
No, with his boot on my throat and
his partner kickin' me...
No, it's a little bit difficult.
Everyone comes here,
they have a complaint.
They sit down, I've been waiting
here for motherfuckin' 5 hours,
and now you do ask me:
do I have a complaint.
Obviously I have a complaint.
You know what, this is some bullshit.
That's why I hate all
these motherfuckers.
Fuck all ya!
Wander has got sense of humor,
I give him that.
Do you have a complaint?
Where to begin?
The black band.
Man down.
Hurts, right?
Losing a colleague,
a brother in blue.
I am sorry he's gone, sir.
You two worked Vice Special together,
pushed the black and
white in the Southend.
"Phonebook Tom."
The last of the ghetto gunfighters.
Heard you got your best
confession with a '91 directory.
You know Washington was holding
me assholed down.
Is this an interview?
Just a little back and forth.
Look, Captain, I'm not much a dancer.
So if there's something
you'd like to ask...
Why don't we go get some lunch, Tom?
This is the interview.
Regarding yesterday's incident.
You were the first on scene, correct?
Yes, sir.
Three shooters, right?
Two. Read the report.
What would you say if I told you that
the pathologists recovered
three different calibres
from Terrence Washington's body?
That sounds like three shooters to me.
What are you doing here, Tom?
Come on, man to man.
Tape's off.
Damn it!
It doesn't bother you that
there are two cop killers out there
living, laughing, fucking?
It doesn't bother you, Tom?
Yes, it bothers me.
So why'd you let them
get away, gunfighter?
Hey, let's get something
straight Captain.
Nobody's getting away.
What happened to the
video from the store?
What video?
Listen to me.
Every time you shit in the bed,
Wander's there to change the sheets.
Well, not anymore, son.
I'm gonna pour gas on you,
and I'm gonna pour gas on Wander
and everyone in Vice Special.
Then I'm lighting a match
and I'm gonna burn all of you.
I tried to save you,
Detective Ludlow.
Your window's closed.
And that third shooter?
He's mine, so help me God.
Get back into your office!
I'll call you back.
What the fuck are you
doing in my office?
What the fuck are you doing,
jamming my people at lunch?
If you got a problem with Ludlow,
you come to me.
You keep your dog on a leash.
Everybody knows he can't
make a move without you.
- You go cry to daddy?
- Stop, right there.
Stop.
Tom is a damn fine cop.
He bleeds cool.
You got an open case on him?
Vice Special?
You got one on me?
You formally inverstigating us?
This is a fishing expedition.
'Cause you know
if you went to the chief,
and you asked him
to open a case on me or
anybody on my unit.
he would laugh you out of his office.
Listen to me, you piece of shit.
I watched you intimidate,
bully and blackmail
your way up through the
pay grades for 20-plus years.
I know exactly what you are.
You got no business being a commander.
You like Tom, don't you?
I saw the way you watched
him when we came in.
That's why you're following him around.
You want him to give you a blowjob,
Like that hooker I caught...
you with when we were
sergeants, remember?
Shut up, Jack.
Does your wife know that
you use prostitutes, Jimmy?
That was the best
head  I ever had.
What about you, Jack?
You always found it hard to keep
your prick out of the ghetto.
It's a two-way street, buddy.
You can't ride the tiger forever.
Now get the hell out of my office.
Do the department a favor
and wash your mouth out with buckshot.
Come on, Tom.
Let's get out of here.
In his time on the street,
and through his time in
your schools and homes,
Detective Washington was tireless
in his devotion to his church,
his love for his family...
and his dedication to this department.
Uniform detail,
atten-hut!
Fire guard,
port arms.
Half right, face.
Ready.
Aim! Fire!
Aim!
Fire!
Aim!
Fire!
Uniform detail,
present arms!
- Go back to work.
- Yes sir.
Let's go get 'em.
Sir.
Mrs. Washington?
- I was the first scene.
- Yeah, of course you were.
Excuse me.
Are you Diskant?
Yeah.
You're working on Washington?
Yeah.
You know who I am?
Yes.
Are you not interviewing me?
You are on my list.
Let's get rolling.
Where do I start?
Gang books, mug shots ?
If you want.
Come on, Diskant.
You've worked for homicide before.
I'm 242 .
Okay, 242.
You got the ballistics report?
No.
The bullets are still at the coroner's.
Yeah, but they've given
you updates, right?
Did they tell you how many different
calibres they dug out of Washington?
- What do you want?
- How many?
Goodbye, detective.
Harry, I thought you were dead.
I'm from Vice Special.
Tom Ludlow.
I know who you are.
I handled your wife's autopsy.
That was you?
The asshole, remember?
Right.
The guy who washed away all the
hair and fibre evidence.
The guy who wouldn't do a vaginal swab.
The guy who left me
with nothing to go on.
It's not my job to investigate adultery.
How can I help you?
Pulled these out of Washington?
Yep. 18 rounds. Ten .45 calibre...
full metal jackets,
seven 9 millimeter FMJs
and a single .38 hollow point...
mushroomed against the
scapula .
Serious overkill.
Must've really pissed off the shooters.
Did you get what you were looking for?
I am Detective Diskant, we spoke
on the phone earlier.
- I'm here for the ballistics evidence.
- How're you doing?
- When can I expect the report?
- In about an hour, sir.
- Can you fax this to my office?
- Okay.
Thank you, Doc.
Diskant, talk to me.
You got three different calibres,
that means three weapons.
What's your take went
on down in that market?
Two bad guys come through the front door...
to rob the place, one
of them sees the clerk,
cut's him in half, the other one sees
Washington, whose weapon
is already drawn,
empties his clip into him.
His buddy joins the party,
till he runs dry,
then one of them pulls a .38,
pumps a final "fuck you"-round
into Washington's back.
They leave, you show up
after they're gone.
Got it all figured out.
I got your back here,
but you got to keep your distance
and let me work this case.
No one's gonna find these assholes.
Is that what you need to hear from me?
Are you fucking kidding me?
They get a pass and you get a pass.
That's the deal, right?
What are you talking about,
"the shooters get a pass"?
I don't understand.
Clady said you were on board.
Not with this.
What is the deal?
You throw in this case for a promotion?
If I were you I'd be
more morried about yourself.
Hey, you piece of shit! You got a
and you're fucking
lettin' the suspects walk?
- You want these guys found?
- That doesn't piss you off?
- So they can put you out in the????
- Fuck off!
Place you in the store
before the shooting?
Do you want to catch
a felony for obstruction?
If I say you weren't there,
you weren't there.
This is your mess,
and I'm cleaning it up.
Yeah, it pisses me off.
Diskant.
Yeah.
Yes, hang on one second.
All right, go ahead.
All right, thank you.
Bye bye.
You write in codes.
The lab found saliva on a cigarette butt
and a bandana outside the store.
The DNA corresponds to those two names.
Congratulations, you
I.D. ed the shooters.
Yeah, normally I would be pretty happy.
Pull the rep sheets. Give me copies.
I'll see you around.
The computer says you
arrested these guys.
Fremont and Coates.
Good guys.
Say hi from me.
Do you remember them?
Who can forget?
Heroin dealers with a
taste for blood.
Came up from Belize to make a sale
and they liked the Southland so much.
They never left.
Yeah, we hooked these fine gentlemen
on a rape/mutilation caper.
It seems they had a
three day hostage fest
with this cute little Guatemalan chick.
They snatched her up
when she was walking over from school.
Hurt her bad.
- Then why are they on the streets?
- They walked from the????.
One of our own felt we violated
Mr. Coates' and Mr.
Fremont's civil rights
and told the city attorney.
- Washington dimed you out.
- Yeah.
Why do you think they put that dude
community relations?
Are you shittin' me?
Washington kicked loose
the very guys who whacked him?
Damn ironic, isn't it?
Hello, guys.
What is this, a garage sale?
Hello, Lud?
What's this?
Why...uh...
Why do you have this?
Those are the shitbags
who popped Washington.
Sarge, we can get these guys.
No, no.
Not if you want to keep your badge.
Besides, these two animals?
These guys,
they'll take care of each other.
They'll be dead by the end of the week.
Probably shoot
each other's fucking faces off.
no one needs to.
You know how this shit it works.
This week's suspect,
next week's victims.
Right?
Yeah, right.
- What are you doing here, Tom?
- Let's talk.
I'm sick of this shit, man.
It's the same damn song for three years.
Crying about your wife.
She's gone, Tom.
What's it going to take
to bring you back from Mars?
Have I ever asked you for anything?
You know what,
you ask me for shit all the time.
Big things, Jack?
Important things.
What's up, Tom?
Give me a green light to...
take out the assholes
who did Washington.
Come on, Jack.
King's X.
What the hell is this?
I can lay them out like
I did those Koreans, but off the books.
I'm talking shovels and trash bags.
Who's going to know?
Who's going to care?
The Koreans...
that was business.
This is some crazy bullshit...
wrapped around in that
drunk ass mind of yours.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself Tom, you're a mess!
When did you start drinking today?
You're little airplane bottles of vodka.
And you drove over here intoxicated.
You want a second DUI?
No one's going to fuck with me, Jack!
You're not listening to me!
You're not listening to me!
No, you listen to me.
This is much bigger than that.
Do you think Biggs is stupid?
He has a PhD in catching cops slipping.
You know this.
You know all this.
You gotta hold your mud .
Can you do that?
It's time to turn the page
and close the book.
They took $200.
I had forgotten about this
until I saw this.
That's the man.
That's him.
They took all my pay.
Said it was for the cookie jar.
The cookie jar.
That's what he said.
I'll be right back.
What do you want, Disco?
Washington was dirty.
He was a piece of shit.
Why are you telling me this?
I think you know why.
I know why.
- Got it in this? Huh?
- That's a new phone.
You're working for Internal Affairs.
You made one deal,
maybe you made two?
Did Captain Biggs
flip you to the dark side, punk?
You know what?
They're right about you.
You are fucking out there .
From now on you stay away from me.
We don't talk.
Hold on, Disco.
Hold on.
I gotta watch my own back
these days, you know?
Come on.
Don't be mad.
Washington was dirty.
Hit me, princess.
Come on.
Couple of things.
You know, we found $50,000 in cash
??? at the store?
No, I didn't. That's a lot of cash
but not in itself damning.
Oh, but this is.
Looks like an evidence tag.
I found it in Washington's truck.
I had SID
...
scan it, corresponds
to a kilo of heroin.
Guess who comes along
and signs up the dope?
Washington.
Washington signed out heroin
and returned brown sugar.
Guys who worked  him moved dope.
You know, Washington sprung them from
a rape  on a technicality.
No, I did not know that.
Maybe they had a business arrangement.
Maybe it was a hit?
That would explain
the heavy artillery.
Washington deserved it, right?
He was dirty, so fuck him.
I feel much better
about the suspects walking,
And you must feel better, too, right?
We're doing the right thing.
No shame if you want to take your pass.
This has to be you and me.
Why do you think we're
in the goddamn bathroom?
This is it. The last known address.
We are cops.
Do you live here?
How long have you been living here?
Three months.
Who's living with you?
My mum, my dad, my sisters and brothers
and my cousin Grisella.
No one else?
Okay.
Family or not.
Our boys are long gone.
All right, Disco.
See those yahoos ?
I'm gonna jam 'em.
And when I do,
one of them is gonna bolt .
That's the one that has to do it.
Are you bored or something?
This is their hood.
If anyone knows Fremont
and Coates, they do.
- Fuck it.
- Look at those guys.
Get him.
Suck on my balls!
Go home.
You're in the wrong neighborhood.
Watch out!
Run, amigo.
Spencer.
I had him.
Why are you running, man?
