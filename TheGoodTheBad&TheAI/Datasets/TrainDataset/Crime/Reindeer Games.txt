I figured you walked outta there
and saw my clothes or something,
and youjust walked
right the otherway.
- You know, maybeyou saw
my coat or my hair--
- Hey, I likeyour coat !
Maybeyou, um--
Maybeyou saw me
and I didn't--
Ashley, no.
That was me.
I thoughtyou said
you, uh, had curly hair.
I do. It's very curly.
When it gets long, it's really curly.
But I cut it short.
I can grow it out again, ifyou want.
I can get it pretty bushy.
No ! No, no, no.
I wantyou to be
whoyou wanna be.
Do that again.
What ?
Smile like that.
Come on.

Is this the first time
you ever done somethin' like this ?
You, look atyou.
So pretty, sweet.
Whywereyou writing to a guy,
some con, you don't even know ?
- I told you, Nick. Remember ?
- Tell me again.
All the guys
I've ever been with,
they neverwanted
to get to know me.
Who I am... inside.
Theyjust wanted to...
get inside.
A guy likeyou, Nick.
God, I mean, six months
beforeyou could even touch my face.
I figure
a guy like that...
is gonna have to work
to get to know me some otherway.
But when I read
whatyou wrote to me,
I said:
'' Here's a guy they say is a criminal,
but he's not.
''Just protected his girl.
''Somebody got killed,
but he's not a killer...
'''cause he did what he had to do
to save somebody.
And the worldjust
didn't see it that way.''
State of Michigan, anyway.
You wrote me
some wonderful things.
It wasn't all me, you know.
It was all you.
The guy I was in with, you know,
he helped me with some
ofthe romantic stuff.
He's a good guy, actually.
You'd like him.
I'm talkin' about the heart,
not the words.
Yeah, well,
some ofthe heart
might've been his too.
Yeah ?
You should've signed his name,
then he'd be here right now.

what he's capable of. He will kill you.
Ifyou keep telling him
thatyou're notyou, he will kill you.
Says here the retail industry
does fifty percent ofits business...
between December 1
and December 25.
That's halfa year's business
in one month's time.
It seems to me an intelligent
countrywould legislate a second
such gift-giving holiday.
Create, say, a Christmas Two,
late May or earlyJune,
to further stimulate growth.
Ever sinceyou been goin'
to night school, you been
giving me headaches,Jumpy.
Christmas Two.
just--
'' My sweet, sexy
Ashy-lashy.
''I have been dreaming ofyou
constantly,
''and knowing you are out there

''SomedayI'mgonna takeyou

He'snot theguy. Iunderstand

but why wouldhe tellher
thathe'snot theguy ?
Maybe--
Maybe he's not the guy.
Look, ifI went in thejoint

The man who wrote those letters

He lived for her.
Where's she work ?
What ?
Wroteyou a hundred letters,

Bam-Bam.
- What'd they call her in college ?
- What college ?
- What's her greatest fear ?
- Brother.
Ooh, oh, wrong.
It's drowning.
Wrong, it's her brother.
That's love.
It's time
to start talking,
Nick.
Time to start
tellin' tales.
- Get him up here.
- No, no, no ! Fuck that !
Nick doesn't do anything
till Nick gets something for Nick.
Ya got it ?
I want some hot chocolate.
You wanna hear

Mmm, sure nice pie.
So, when you worked there--
You knew the place--
Okay.
You know what ? I could really go
for some onion rings.
You said talk. That's all you s--
Gabriel, yousaid
you wantedto talk.
- How much money is in that casino ?
- Hard to say.
Well, take a guess.
Five million ?
-Jesus. Come here.
- You, uh, you wrote Ash
a letterwith a story...
about working Christmas Eve.
About how they send halfthe security
guys home. Nobody's comin' in and out.
And the rest ofya
are gettin' shit-faced.
Thata truestoryornot ?
Uh, Christmas Eve.
We're takin' down that casino,
convict.
And you're the guy
that's gonna tell us how.
That's what we can see.
Now, you tell us what we can't see.
Where the private doors go,
where thealarmsare,
what the upstairs looks like, allofit.
- That's not the Tomahawk.
- What the hell areyou talkin' about ?
What's this, the cage ?
I mean, the cage is over here.
Ya got--
This whole thing's mixed up.
- That's what it looks like, Romeo.
- Since when ?
Imean, what's this ?
- That's the prime rib buffet. $5.99.
- Buffet ?
Buffetis overhere
by thebar.
They must've remodeled
the place.
- What ?
- Bigguy, theboss.
- The guy that ran the place,
was in charge.
-Jack Bangs.
jack Bangs ! Was always talkin'
about giving the place a makeover.
Must've gone ahead and done that
while I was in the Mountain.
Imean, this thing's
all changedaround.
Ican'thelpyou with this. Idon't

- Ihavenoidea.
- Look I don't care about
the pancake breakfast. I--
You wanna know about money,
right ?
Okay. Whereyou got the buffet down
here ? That used to be Bang's office.
And he kept a safe in there.
And that safe had all the money
that he was skimming in there.
- And it was called the pow-wow safe.
- Pow-wow safe ?
Yes, pow-wowsafe.
'Cause he was stealing money
from the tribe.
The guy had thousands in there.
Millions probably.
Millions ?
In the pow-wow safe ?
Millions.
But, I mean, you know,

God knows what else is different.
You know ?
The security, the--
You wantme toshowyou

Because, ifyou get me inside,

I know the security routines.
I know their signals to each other.
Iknowhowthey operate.
Yougetmein there,

I thought he meant after
New Years, back in Detroit.
- Butyou knew what he wanted. Right ?
- I thought we had more days.
Forwhat ? What areyou gonna do ?
Talk me into helping ?
You know how I feel about my brother !
You know how I hate him.
What did you think's gonna happen ?
This thing's gonna be over
and he's gonna let me go ?
He's gonna shoot me
in the back ofthe head like this !
Or I'm back in prison for the rest
ofmy life, and that's it for me !
This is my life too, you know.
You think he'sjust gonna let me walk ?
You think he's not gonna
take this out on me ?
I'm in this too,
and I'm really scared.
Please !
Nick. Nick.
Doyou remember all
those letters you wrote me ?
About me and you

God !
You know,
it'sjust my luck.
I finally meet a boy that
I'm crazy about, and my brother
wants him worse than I do.
Why didn'tyou tell me

Gabriel knows some guys
in Miami and New York.
Guys that he helps
get guns to Detroit.
- That'sit. That'sallIknow.
- And that's who he's
working for on this one ?
No. He doesn't
wanna work for anyone.
- What's the last place they took down ?
- What ?
Monster and his merry men.
What's the last place they robbed ?
Who they ripped off ?
What did they do ?
I don't think they've robbed anywhere
before. Theyjust-- They drive guns !
They've never done a robbery ?
Really ?
They really do need me.
They actually need me.
Oh, yeah, candlesburin'low

- Thought this through entirely ?
- It was that or a ballerina.
Well, I mean, I'm gonna need
some money. It is a casino.
- Ten bucks ? What am I
gonna do with ten bucks ?
- Don't tip.
Look, ifwe're
gonna be workin' together,
you shouldn't send me in there
like the Lone Ranger
with ten bucks to throw down.
You want me to not get noticed.
Not gettin' noticed costs
at least a couple hundred.

Four, fivemillionmiles
ofroad. Hardroad.
Tell 'em I was tired,
shit, they'djust hire someone else.
A thousandmiles bysundown
orthegang don'teatcomesunrise.
Sh-Shit.
And every road,
every mile,
it's nothin' but moms and pops and
car-seat kiddies giving me that look...
- to go to hell and get off
their happy goddamn highway.
-
So-- So I have worked...
and I have slaved,
and I have waited...
for the highways to split open...
and for the rivers to roil
and for God in the heavens...
to reach down and show me
some sign ofmy reward,
to grant me with my gift
and say to me,
''Gabriel, my son,
you are done with the road.''
Well, convict,
that gift was granted.
Look, man, I swear to God,
hejust wanted to know how I heard
about the place, that's all.
He didn't know it was me, Gabriel.
He didn't know it was me ! Please !
Man, Monster,just don't
start trying to hit me.
Nick, I've been trying
to hityou.
-
-
Because I do not deserve
to be in some shit-bag motel...
in the middle
ofbum-fuck Michigan,
throwing darts
at a worthless...
-
- convict!
You know-- You know somethin' ?
- My little sister--
-
she deserves
a worldbetterthanyou.
Tonight we're gonna take
one more look at that map,

What the fuck
did you do to him ?
Bastard.
Get out ! Get out !

- Okay. Come here.

-
-Jesus.
Thereyou go. Okay.
All I wanted to do was to
make it back to Sidnaw...
and have some of
Mom's gravy, you know,
and some ofAunt Elizabeth's
cranberry cakes.
She makes 'em with, uh,
real cranberries.
It's... really good.

You saved my life, Nick.
You could've run,
butyou didn't.
- You saved me.

I saved you because
I loveyou, Nick.
Why did you save me ?
The guy I was in with--
Rudy, the car thief--
sometimes I read him
your letters.
I mean, I know
theywere private, but,
you know,
I'd read 'em to him,
and he'd get this look on his face.
I swear, I think he imagined
you were writing to him.
And I know sometimes,
I think,
he fell in love with you too.
You gave a couple ofguys hope,
Ashley.
Hope is a good thing.
We're gonna get out
ofthis... together.
I promiseyou.
I promiseyou.
Start singing, Nick.

You wanna get to the security,
and then from the security
you get down to the cashier cage,

Take a look !
By the timeyou hit the bottom
down there, the whole car
was burning like a comet.
Must have burned up
all that money too.
Was ityour idea, Monster ?
Orwas it hers ?
Well, she told me about
the convict magazines.
Had to figure there'd be some guys
in the pen with some useful knowledge...
with nobody to talk to
and nobody to listen.
So, wejust stocked up
on stationery.
It'sahardlife
beinga trucker's girl.

He really loved you,

Nick. He reallylovedyou.
Who wouldn't ?
Maybe this is where
you wantedhim, Ashley.
Some stranger at the bottom
ofa ravine with a burned-up heart.
Maybe.
But it didn't happen.

- Shut up.
Get up. Come on.

- What ? What did you say ?
I said, '' Don't talk to me
about greed !''
No, not about that. About--
You said, ''A guy takes a shiv foryou.''
I never said anything about a shiv.
How'd you know there was a shiv ?
You said it. You said
the real Nick died saving you.
No, I didn't.
I said he died.

Twoyears in the Mountain, man.
What the hell ?
Why not let her get friendly
with them ?
Tell them her real name

Paid a guard to spread
the word I'd bought it.
And once the wound healed up,
got out ofthe Mountain this morning.
Tonight, I'm arichman.
Get in the car.
Keepyour gun on him, honey.
How'd you know I'd do it ?
Because every time
I read her letters, Rudy,
you listened.
Besides, man,
ifyouhadn't taken thebait,
we'd have still had a shot.
She'd havejust had to convince 'em
they could do it alone.
But what doyou know ?
Good ol' Rudy came through.
Good old predictable Rudy.
Goes forthe easymoney...
every time.
Five Santas walked into
that Tomahawk, Rudy.
That's what the witnesses will say.
So we gotta have
five Santas not walk out.
Gotta have five.
How many things could have gone wrong ?
Huh ? A thousand.
You thinkwe don't know
what a long shot is ? Huh ?
My girl Millie

You're right. I do love her.
