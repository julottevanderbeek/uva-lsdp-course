"My Reminiscence."
I always thought that
for such a lovely river,
the name was mystifying:
"Cape Fear."
When the only thing to fear on
those enchanted summer nights...
was that
the magic would end,
and real life
would come crashing in.
Already read 'em.
Hi. How are you?
No, no.
That means clean.
These are dirty.
Not the most mind-blowing
concept for a travel agency,
but what the hey?
Like an arrow,
maybe?
Yeah, like an arrow.
a company that
you can trust.
If you can balance those
ideas in a way that's
pleasing to the eye,
then you got a logo.
and an arrow.
Okay,
I'll think of something
for that one.
They switched babies on me
at the hospital, didn't they?
How'd you do
in there?
I got the judge to
postpone the alimony
hearing for 21 days.
Oh, great.
I've got till Monday
to find out which S&L,
in which municipality...
my son-in-law stashed
all that money.
Right, right.
But I thank you and
my daughter thanks you.
You're welcome, Tom.
Here's... Daddy!
Good-bye,
junior!
Sayonara!
What is this?
This smoke?
Excuse me...
Excuse me.
Let's move
our seats.
Do you believe that
annoying, loser guy?
Dad, you should've
punched him out.
Punched him out?
What do you mean?
You box.
You could've shoved him,
shut him up.
Yeah, yeah.
I could take you.
That's who I could take.
You could've kicked
him in the face.
Kicked him?
Yeah, you know how
to fight dirty.
Real cute, Leigh.
How much do I
owe you?
It's taken care of.
Taken care of?
Who?
There.
Girls, girls.
Come on,
let's sit inside.
Whoa!
Mr. Perfect form!
No, no, I don't.
Look, you gotta snap
your wrist on the backhand.
Usually I like a little
music at this point.
All right,
all right.
You gotta
snap your wrist.
Tag.
You know, we should stop
doing this for awhile.
Doing what?
We're not doing anything.
I know that.
Yet.
Okay, fine.
Maybe you're right.
Does your wife mind?
My wife doesn't even
know you exist,
which most certainly
is for the best.
Why's that?
Lori, you know why you have
to ask that question?
'Cause you've
never been married.
Is marriage synonymous
with deception?
No, no, no.
It's just that
when two people...
When two people
get married...
and they live together
for a long time, it's uh...
I like hanging out
with you, so sue me.
You're funny
and you're cute,
and we talk
about the courts...
and which judge
is senile...
and which one wears
a gun under his robe.
You know, Lori,
another time, another place.
Who knows, you know?
Tomorrow?
Yeah, it's
a light docket.
No, no. I've won
two out of three.
Let's make it the
best out of five.
That's good, actually,
because today I let you win.
- Sure you did.
- See ya.
Hey!
Free as a bird, apparently.
You go everywhere you want
with whomever.
That much freedom could
get a fella into trouble.
I'd like my keys.
Could it be you
don't remember me?
Sure, I remember you.
You were at the movie house.
Oh, I'm disappointed.
I'm hurt.
I would like my keys.
Max Cady.
You look the same.
Maybe 15 pounds heavier.
But they say the average man
gains a pound a year...
Oh, come on.
Gains a pound a year
till he's about 60.
Me, I dropped a pound
every year of my sentence.
Atlanta, '77.
You got it.
July.
Fourteen years since
I held a set of keys.
You look good,
healthy.
Thank you,
'cause it's a struggle to
stay healthy in the joint.
But you wouldn't know
about that, would ya?
If you were me, they'd stick
you with the white trash.
They don't strike
a lick of work all day.
This little ol' cigar
is my only vice.
I needed a vice in the joint
to remind me I was human.
What brings you
to New Essex?
Oh, the climate.
Boy, the south.
I'm thinkin' of
settlin' here in
New Essex, Counselor.
Have you been following me?
It's a small town.
Everywhere you turn,
we're gonna run into each other.
Take care,
Mr. Cady.
You too.
You're gonna learn
about loss.
What?
##
Dad, could you...
hmm?
Sorry, Danny.
What're you
working on?
It's English.
We're supposed to read
which is a kind
of reminiscence,
and we have to attempt
something in the same style.
What's it about,
your reminiscence?
The houseboat.
We ought to take two weeks off
and go up to Wilmington...
like the old times,
down to the houseboat.
I probably don't.
Now I don't, either.
Danny's got summer
school till labor day.
She can't miss
two damn weeks?
You know, the alternative
was to expel her.
Maybe this drama teacher
from the college...
will get her excited
about something.
About him, probably.
Why'd they have to make
such a stink,
like she was on
heroin or something?
I mean,
what's marijuana?
You and I smoked
dope in our time.
In some cultures,
it's considered
almost a sacrament.
I realize in ours
it's forbidden.
Right up there with
incest and necrophilia
and bestiality...
Honey, honey,
honey.
Worship of idols,
cannibalism.
Do that again.
What?
Do that again.
What?
I saw him when the
fireworks went off.
What?
I think I talked to him
this afternoon.
You know him?
I want you the hell
off my property!
He's gone.
or "I'm gonna make you
learn about loss."
Something like that.
That's very poetic.
Who is he, and where
did he come from?
Leigh, get the dog off.
Ben, get down.
He shouldn't be up
on the table.
Get down.
He's from the hills,
Pentecostal crackers.
What was he
in prison for?
I think it was battery.
Did he batter a man?
Did he batter a woman?
It was 14 years ago.
You know, it's kinda...
What does he
want with you?
He's an ex-con,
so he's just...
You know, he's probably
upset at the lawyer.
Yeah, your clientele.
Bye, Danny.
Thanks.
I needed that.
I don't want
to alarm her,
but I'd rather Danny
didn't wander alone...
on her soul-searching
walks in the woods,
at least till I've
started a few things.
What if she takes
Benjamin with her?
Ben, our guard dog?
What's he gonna do,
lick him to death?
I don't mean his biography,
just there's some creep around.
If you see him again,
call the cops and
then call me.
What about a weapon?
In case things get
exciting around here.
Would you feel more secure with
a loaded gun in the house?
We'd end up using it
on each other.
Or Danny would.
He's not gonna do anything.
He just got out of prison.
Call Lee Heller.
Lee's a colorful character,
but he's still the best
criminal lawyer in the state.
Good.
You defended this guy,
right?
So what makes you think
he wants to harm you?
Yesterday I was
getting in my car.
The guy comes up.
We have a conversation.
He says to me,
"You're gonna learn about loss."
That'd hardly qualify under
the terrorist threat statutes.
Come on, Tom!
The guy's an ex-con!
You know as well as I do
what that means.
Last night, there he was
behind our house.
- Attempted b and E.
- No, not exactly.
He was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property.
What can I say?
Get a restraining order.
I filed one this morning.
The hearing's in ten days.
Tom, 14 years ago...
in this case,
I had a report
on a victim.
That's right, rape and
aggravated sexual battery.
I had a report
on this victim,
and it came back that
she was promiscuous.
And, uh...
I buried it.
Whew.
No, I buried it.
I didn't show it to the client,
to the prosecution.
But if you had seen
what this guy had
done to this girl...
"In every criminal prosecution,
the accused shall have...
the assistance of counsel
for his defense."
but I believe in
the 6th Amendment.
That's why I left
the public defender's office.
Some folks just don't have
the right to the best defense?
But if you had seen what
he did to this girl...
If it was your
own daughter, Tom...
Buried the report.
Jesus, Sam.
Oh, God.
But I don't see
how he could know that.
He was illiterate.
I had to read everything to him:
The probable cause affidavit,
the arrest reports,
everything.
There's no way
he could know that.
Danny, it's so quiet out here
and the light's so perfect.
Why don't you get your book
and come out here and read?
I told you why.
Well, is it because
he's like a flasher
or just a peeper?
What do you know about that?
A flasher?
You don't think I've
been flashed before?
I didn't mean to insult you.
I'm sure you've been flashed.
If you want to come out,
come on out.
Do whatever you want.
Oh, but don't
go outside.
What do you want,
Mr. Cady?
They're great at that age,
ain't they?
All those discoveries
ahead of them.
You're lucky,
Counselor.
My own daughter,
she don't even know me.
After I went inside,
her mama told her I was dead.
Which,
in a way, I was.
Look, Mr. Cady,
I realize that you suffered.
I understand your problem,
but I mean, why me?
I was your lawyer.
I defended you.
Why not badger the D.A.
Or the judge?
"Badger"?
Why not them?
Badger.
Why not?
Best I remember, they was just
doin' right by their jobs.
I didn't do my job?
Is that right?
I pleaded you out to
a lesser included offense.
You could've gotten rape
instead of battery.
I'd have been up for parole
either way in seven years.
You could've gotten life.
You could've done death.
You could be sittin' on
death row right now.
I learned to read
durin' my stretch.
First,
then
then law books, mostly.
Did you know that after
I discharged you,
I acted as my
own attorney?
Applied several times
for an appeal.
No, I didn't
know that.
Mm-hmm.
So, here we are...
two lawyers,
for all practical purposes,
talkin' shop.
How much do you want,
Mr. Cady?
How much do I want what?
How much money
do you want?
Money? Counselor,
do I look destitute to you?
I'm open to discussion,
within reasonable limits.
You ever been a woman?
A what?
A woman.
Some fat, hairy,
ugly hillbilly's wet dream.
I realize that you suffered.
There's no question about that.
You don't know what
sufferin' is, Counselor.
Like it says
in Galatians 3:
"Have ye suffered
so many things in vain?"
I learned from the get-go
in the joint...
to get in touch with the
soft side of myself,
the feminine side.
Well, I'm open to some
sort of discussion...
on compensation.
What shall be my
compensation, sir,
for being held down and
sodomized by four white guys?
Or four black guys?
Shall my compensation
be the same?
What is the formula
for compensation, sir?
How about
$ 10,000 in cash?
Do l...
Let's just
break that down.
That figure just came
to the top of my head.
Let's break it down.
For argument's sake,
let's say $20,000, $30,000.
I'll tell you what,
let's say $50,000.
$50,000 into 14 years.
Fourteen years
times 365 days...
I'd say is about
You divide that by $50,000,
and that's like $ 10 a day.
That's not even
minimum wage!
To say nothing about the family
that I lost, the respect.
I don't think you really,
really understand...
what we're talkin'
about here.
Fourteen years.
Whoops!
Uh-oh!
Gotta git. I'm late
for another appointment.
Sam, my man,
I got some good news.
I got the bank,
the account number.
I'll call your
son-in-law's lawyer.
Ask her to hold.
I gotta make a call.
I wouldn't make that call.
The way I'd handle...
Yeah?
They sounded like
he was screaming.
And then Danny came
running in, and...
I called the vet.
And then it was
so weird, because...
it was like he was
winding down,
just winding down
like an old clock.
And then all of a sudden
he just stopped.
He had this kind of...
his eyes just wide open,
and this kind of...
surprised look.
And then he died.
He just died, before
the vet even got here.
What'd the vet say?
That he was poisoned.
What kind of a poison?
I don't know
what kind of poison.
I told you not
to let him out!
- I didn't let him out!
- Then how?
I've got an English Setter,
so I don't cotton
to dog killers.
Trouble is, poisoning
a dog is just a fine.
But if he's unemployed,
he's gotta have money
or we'll bust him for vagrancy.
We'll give him
a full-body strip search.
Jerk a knot
in his tail.
All right.
That him?
One-way mirror.
He doesn't know
you're here.
Yeah, that's him.
Get the shirt off.
Sheesh.
I don't know whether
to look at him or read him.
We searched his apartment.
His car registration,
everything's in order.
His mother died,
the farm got sold.
He got the proceeds.
Well, he's got money.
Where does that leave us?
You let the dog out.
Cady abducted him.
No, uh...
we didn't let the dog out.
Cady came
into your house?
That's illegal entry
with intent!
No, no, no.
But he didn't come
into the house.
I don't know exactly
how he did it,
I just know
that he did it.
That's not good enough,
Mr. Bowden.
You're a lawyer.
You damn-well know that.
He's gonna screw up.
The Sheriff assured me
that they always do.
He's gonna get
the message in
no uncertain terms.
I'd still like
to kill him.
##
You can tap.
You can do that.
You can tap.
Dance.
I wanted to once,
but I don't know.
Son-of-a-bitch!
What?
He's staring at you.
What the hell
are you doin'?
Mmm, hot as a firecracker
on the 4th of July.
Son-of-a-bitch!
- Where the hell did he go?
- Son-of-a-bitch!
Watch my arm.
It might be broke.
What's with you, buddy?
You have no right to be
pushin' me around.
I was just watchin'
the parade.
Son-of-a-bitch!
You're lucky
I don't sue you.
All right,
all right!
Sam, what are
you doing?
It's nothing.
Who was that?
Let's go.
Mom.
Just put a goldfish in it
and you'll be fine.
You seem to be having
a good time.
I've been
practicing.
A life of debauchery.
Debauch...
Debauchery.
It's a three-syllable word.
Making fun of me?
That's okay, no problem.
I made you blush.
Blush?
You're now the color
of your shirt: Scarlet.
I had no business
getting stuck on a
guy who was married.
You certainly did not.
I don't know
what I was thinking.
God only knows.
Aren't I the bozo
on this bus?
Lest you think that I slept
with this particular...
That's your business.
That's not mine.
I don't want it to sound
like I've been through...
That's the way
it sounded to me.
He was the first.
He was, I swear.
Tell it to
the judge.
Actually, the rat
stood me up today.
What a shame.
I know.
Now it's my turn.
Where are you from?
Where am I from?
You're gonna love this.
I'm from, uh... Georgia State
Correctional Facility.
Oh, my God.
This is the way my day's
been turning out.
Do you want
to hear it?
Liven up the night.
An unmarried woman, uh...
wait, that's not it.
Get the joke straight,
darlin'.
Shut up!
An unmarried woman,
she meets a guy,
and he tells her he just
got out of prison.
"What'd you do?"
She asks.
"I hacked my wife into 52
pieces with a chain saw."
She says... She says,
"So, you're single?"
That's even
funnier!
Thank you.
Could I ask you something?
What did you do?
I hacked my wife
into 52 pieces.
I was afraid you were
gonna say that.
I'm a very small person,
so maybe...
Well, maybe I can hack you
into 40 pieces.
What did you do,
really?
No, really,
but what did you do?
There was this protest march
on this nuclear power plant.
And so when they came
to arrest us,
this macho sheriff got rough
with the lady behind me,
so I popped the bastard.
So they gave me
a little time for it.
I'm drinking
a Sea Breeze.
I hope you can
afford them.
You gotta stay sober.
If you ain't sober,
you're takin' your chances.
'Cause I'm just
one hell of an animal.
Yeah?
Do tell.
Get you on this side, doll.
Let's do this.
Who is Loretta?
That's the love of my life.
She's no longer with us.
I thought I was the
love of your life.
Chopped her into 52 pieces.
He hurt you like this,
that married guy?
He hurt you like this?
Like this?
Oh, scandal!
He's a rough one.
How's this feel?
Oh, my God.
Am I under arrest?
Not quite, darlin'.
Officer, I swear,
it's all a mistake.
That married guy
hurt you like this?
'Cause what he did to me
hurt a lot worse than this!
No!
Ahhh!
I've got you now,
bitch!
Danny, when did this key
stop working?
What? Oh.
I don't know.
No wonder.
A wire's missing.
Was somebody fooling
around with the piano?
What?
Yeah?
Mr. Bowden,
I think we might could have
a little break here.
Good, good.
I can be there in a half-hour.
All right, fine.
Cady raped
another girl.
Rape?
You said it was battery.
The case was a wobbler.
I got it reduced.
I remember those days,
"old slippery Sam."
I just didn't want to
alarm you or Danny.
How old was
that girl?
Sixteen.
Sixteen?
What?
Well, my birthday
is coming up.
Neighbors heard screams
and called us.
When the perp drove off,
somebody made his plate.
Max Cady.
Great.
We got one bitty problem.
Girl's scared.
She's claiming
she fell down some stairs.
Sam...
don't...
don't look at me.
Oh, my God.
You two
know each other?
Um...
Yeah,
we work together.
I'll be outside.
Oh, Lori, don't.
You stood me up
at the club the other day,
and then you didn't call.
And by last night
I was feeling...
pretty reckless.
I thought about what
you said, you know,
that your wife...
That she didn't know
I existed.
And I felt like...
I was gonna show you.
I guess I showed you,
all right, didn't I?
I guess I really
showed you!
Lori.
Lori, listen to me,
okay?
Now look.
This guy, Cady,
he's done this kind
of thing before.
Now, he's gonna do this
over and over again...
unless you testify...
and we take him
to court...
No.
No, no.
Sam, I know how it works.
I see it every day.
Only this time
I'm on the other side.
I don't want to explain
why I was in a bar,
and how much I had to drink,
and what I was wearing;
not by the people
I work with.
Not by the guys that
I see cross-examine...
other people on the stand.
Just crucify 'em.
They just laugh
about it later.
They'll even
ask about you.
Lori, listen to me.
I don't care about that.
Well,
I care about that.
I'm sure you do, too.
I'm... I'm...
I'm terribly sorry, Lori.
I'm just terribly sorry.
If this is something
personal between you
and the girl and Cady...
Come on,
lieutenant.
All right,
what are you implying?
Only that there are some things
that are better handled quietly,
not by the police.
Cady is planning
to rape my wife,
but it's not your problem.
I can't bust someone for
planning to rape your wife.
You know that damn-well!
Thanks all the same.
File a restraining order?
Get him out of the brush.
How do we do that?
Stake out a couple of your
goats and hide in a tree.
That I use my family as bait?
And then what?
And then blow
his head off?
It would be unethical of me
to advise a citizen...
to take the law
into his own hands.
So, I suppose you
must've misunderstood me.
I guess I must've.
Well, pardon me
all over the place.
He's clever, cleverly so
that the law can't touch him.
I believe he's able to
slip into the house undetected.
Although, is he out?
I can't tell.
He's either out or in.
I'm not sure.
I can't see
through walls.
I'm not askin' you
to see through walls.
Why can't anybody
do anything for me?
What good are cops
and laws...
Sam, Sam, calm down.
Let me explain something.
The system is set up to handle
generalized problems...
like burglary
and robbery.
But if some lone creep targets
you for some obscure reason,
the system's slow
and skeptical.
It's pathetic, even.
I was his lawyer,
his public defender.
But you shafted him
somehow.
Well, at least that's
the way he perceives it.
I don't care what you did.
What did he do?
He raped
a 16-year-old girl.
Do you have a daughter
around 16?
She's 15.
and write you up
a risk assessment.
Great, great.
Now the cops...
I can find him.
Just take it easy,
stay calm.
Danny, you can just
relax because...
your daddy has a private
investigator on the payroll.
Mickey Spillane?
Peter Gunn?
Dirty Harry?
No, Perry Mason
was for lawyers.
The minute I walked in
this guy's office,
I felt relaxed.
This guy's
totally in charge.
Kersek deals with
these types for a living.
He looked like
he was gonna enjoy...
- Yes?
- It's me.
After you left,
I had this conversation with
a C.O. At Statesboro Prison.
Right.
Right.
Hated Cady's cigar smoke,
and was always moanin' about it.
They found him with his neck
broke and his tongue bit off.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah.
Our private eye.
I thought we were
relaxed now.
All right.
Hi, Lori.
It's me, Sam.
Lori, I just feel god-awful
you got dragged into this.
If I had any idea that Cady
would hurt you to get at me,
I would've warned you.
Yep, yep.
I feel the same way.
Excuse me, Lori.
That sounds
real good.
That's gonna work out fine.
I'll get back to ya.
All right, bye.
Well, I just don't know
what I hate more,
that insipid tone
or your stupid,
sophomoric
infidelities.
Who was that, huh?
The girl that got beat up?
Yes, Lori Davis.
I already told you.
She works at
the County Courthouse.
And what?
You're fucking her?
Oh, no.
Interesting choice, Sam.
Calling from our bedroom phone.
I have a private
phone conversation,
you assume that I'm
fucking someone?
That's why that psychopath
chose her, right?
But I'm not fucking
her in any way.
Uh-huh.
You sleazy
son-of-a-bitch!
You son-of-a-bitch!
Damn it!
You son-of-a-bitch!
Stop it!
Leigh!
Oh, honey,
there's nothing the matter.
Yeah, I can see, Dad.
##
The humiliation we went through
confessing our dirty secrets...
in those horrible sessions
with Dr. Hackett.
We talked that one damn
incident to death.
I mean, why did you bother?
Why did you bother!
Why did you bother
with you and me?
With the marriage?
Uprooting me and Danny,
moving?
That's what we decided to do!
You said you wanted to get out!
You don't get it.
What is it
I don't get?
Nadine?
It's Danny.
Nothing.
I'm just losing
my mind here.
You don't have the balls
to walk out,
if that's what
you wanted.
Like I was gonna split
with you acting the way you act.
Acting?
You did some acting.
I don't remember
doing any acting.
You don't remember?
Let me refresh your memory.
Do you remember not
taking any work?
Not fixing any meals?
I'm not on
fucking trial here!
Do you remember crying
every morning and evening?
Do you remember that?
I scared you, huh?
What did
you think, Sam?
You thought maybe
I was gonna kill myself?
Well, who else?
You pompous ass!
You wouldn't leave
the bedroom!
I wish you could
say the same.
Diggin' up the past.
The relevant issue is whether
I've been messin' around,
and I have not been.
That shouldn't
stop you.
She's a baby!
You gravitate to people
in the same profession.
You gravitate to women.
I'm a lawyer, she's a clerk.
She looks up to me!
She's just infatuated.
I can't help that!
Look, Leigh.
I'm scared.
This whole
thing has...
I keep feeling that there's some
animal out there, stalking us.
I think he wants to
hurt us in the worst way.
And that's got me
frightened to death.
You really are scared,
aren't you?
Oh, yeah.
Somebody finally
got to you.
Look, Leigh,
I think that this guy
beat and raped her...
because he knew that
she wouldn't testify,
that she wouldn't
press charges.
Because she knows
the system.
I mean,
she works in it.
She knows
that she'd be on trial.
And then, because she
wouldn't testify,
you would assume that there was
something going on between us...
and it would
cause a rift.
And that we'd be much more
vulnerable to him.
I'm glad we talked about this,
because we can work together.
We can beat that
son-of-a-bitch,
the two of us, together,
working as a team.
Oh, boy!
Jesus.
Oh, yeah,
this is great.
This is somethin' else.
Oh... shit!
I'm sorry.
I haven't ordered yet.
That fellow over there
sent this over, paid for.
Which one?
Excuse me.
Hey, Cady!
Come here.
I've been in a real
bad mood lately.
You know what you can do
to brighten my mood?
- No.
- Get the hell outta here.
Are you my friend?
No, I'm not
your friend.
I thought maybe
you were my friend,
because I like to plan my
comin's and goin's with friends.
But if you're not my friend,
I'd call that presumptuous.
I'd call it downright rude,
'cause I ain't your porch-baby.
Well, gee-golly-gosh.
I sure am sorry I offended you,
you white-trash piece of shit.
Ooh, I got the all-over
fidgets on that one!
You've really shaken me up.
I'm shiverin' all over.
I could get upset.
Things could get outta hand.
And then
in self-defense,
I could do somethin' to you
that you would not like.
You feel squirrelly.
You just jump.
You threatenin' me?
- You threatenin' me?
- You catch on fast.
'Cause I'm well within
my rights to be here.
And if I stay here,
what you gonna do?
I don't give a rat's ass
about your rights.
You watch your step.
What you gonna do,
arrest me?
You a cop, or were
you not good enough
to remain on the force?
That's the feelin'
I'm gettin' here.
Hope you enjoyed
your breakfast.
Ma'am,
this belong to you?
If a dogcatcher comes across
a dog without a license,
he's liable to think
it's a stray...
You know, um...
Our dog is...
He passed away.
Yeah.
A man's best friend.
A woman's, too.
Big, friendly, shaggy,
asleep at your feet.
Keepin' you company while
you're tryin' to finish up...
those pesky,
little sketches.
Oh, you're Max Cady,
aren't you?
I'm just givin' you back
your dog collar.
You want to
look around?
Go ahead, Mr. Cady,
take a good look.
Nice house.
Yeah, it is a nice house.
You satisfied now?
There is gonna be more,
isn't there?
You won't stop
until you're happy.
How can I be happy, Leigh,
when you're not happy?
You don't know
anything about me.
I know what I see,
ma'am.
Mm-hmm.
I wanted to know
what you looked like.
I've been waitin'
to see your face,
but now that I see you,
you are just repulsive.
No.
Guess I'm covered in
too many tattoos.
There's not a whole
lot to do in prison...
but desecrate your flesh.
Who knows? We might've
been different people.
We might've been happy,
Leigh.
- Mom, someone's on the phone!
- Danny, don't come out here!
I thought I'd
catch you here.
Well, that little
smart aleck made me.
He what?
It wasn't my fault.
He was lookin' to be covered.
There is a lot of cutsie-cutsie
in that little prick.
I told ya.
You know where he was?
At the public library reading
Thus Spake Zarathustra,
by Friedrich Nietzsche.
He's this German philosopher.
Said that God is dead.
We can keep goin' this way,
but it's gonna get expensive.
I'm not so concerned about days.
Stay on him a few more nights.
Do you really want
to resolve this situation?
I'd love to resolve it.
There's men that can
be hired, by me,
to do a little
hospital job on Cady.
What are we talkin'
about here?
Two pieces of pipe,
a bicycle chain.
Sam, he won't be
so scary after that.
Are we agreed that
I'm a lawyer?
In here.
Evenin', ladies.
Oh, chicken.
How is everything?
Is everything okay?
Good, good.
He was here today.
Hello?
Yeah.
From English
or drama?
Fine.
No...
Um, there's just been stuff
going on around here.
I doubt it.
Shit happens, you know,
like the T-shirt says.
What do you mean?
Don't suppress
or deny it.
Use it in your life
and your work.
Okay.
I mean, uh...
So, class is tomorrow
in room 110, right?
No, it's been changed
to the theater.
What better place
for drama, right?
And remember, Danielle,
you can use all those fears
to draw upon and learn.
You know this
little tune?
You can trust in me,
'cause I'm the do-right man.
Okay?
'Night now.
Okay.
Good night.
Honey, I think maybe
I should walk you in.
No, it's okay, Mom.
There's a lot of people here.
I'll be right here at
Okay.
Bye...
Hi!
They're just having
a meeting about next
fall's chorus program.
I have to go downstairs
for drama.
Okay.
Bye.
Hello?
Nadine?
I'm here for
the drama class.
Hi.
Oops.
Am I busted?
No.
I hope not.
You can't smoke grass
in school.
Privilege of
the professional.
Eases inhibitions.
You down here for drama?
Yeah. Are you
the drama teacher?
And you're...
let me guess.
Cecile James?
No. I'm, uh...
Danielle Bowden.
Danielle? Oh,
we spoke last night.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How rude.
It's okay.
Um...
# I think we're
alone now #
Okay.
Hmm.
Thanks.
I'm gonna
give this to you.
Ow.
Little trick I learned.
Take it.
You know, when we spoke
on the phone last night?
Um... you really made sense
to me and...
I thought a lot.
Those are human truths, darlin'.
That's what it's all about.
That's what
we deal with here.
It's all about self-discovery,
the inner voyage.
I like the end where, um...
Eugene's journey...
It was really, uh,
mystical, you know.
And it was almost like
a pilgrimage?
Almost like a cop-out,
if you ask me.
Those were the facts
of Wolfe's life.
The novel is what you would call
a "roman a clef."
I'm not sure.
you can't escape your demons
just by leaving home.
Although writers do find
new freedom when they
relocate abroad.
Take Henry Miller.
Have you read his trilogy?
"
No.
You're missin'
something.
Well, you know what?
I did read
Just parts of it though,
'cause, uh...
I had to sneak it off
my parents' shelf, you know?
But, his descriptions are
pretty vivid, I would say.
In one of the novels,
I don't recall which,
he describes an erection
as a piece of lead
with wings on it.
I didn't read
that part.
Your parents don't want
you to achieve adulthood.
That's natural.
They know the pitfalls
of adulthood, all that freedom.
They know it
only too well.
for a crime that's
not even a crime...
for smokin' grass.
Wh...
Wait a second.
Um... where are you from?
Where am I from?
Where do you think
I'm from?
I don't know, but...
If I told you,
you gonna get mad at me?
No.
I'm from a black forest.
That's funny.
You're not the
drama teacher, are you?
Maybe I'm the
big, bad wolf.
Um...
So, you're that guy that's
been hanging around the house?
You're the one that
killed my mom's dog?
Your mom's dog was killed?
Yeah.
I didn't even know
anything about that.
That's a shame.
That's a damn shame.
Yes, it was.
Um...
I don't know.
He was just...
He was fluffy and...
Fluffy?
Mm-hmm.
So you didn't do that?
Of course
I didn't do that.
