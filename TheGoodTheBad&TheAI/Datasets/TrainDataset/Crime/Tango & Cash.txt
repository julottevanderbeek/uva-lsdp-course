Okay, let's do it.
You are eastbound,
pursuing tanker truck.
Backup is available.
Air Unit 3 is in the area.
I can handle this myself.
This is Air Unit 3.
Forget it, Tango.
we'll take over.
Drop back.
Drop dead. I've been
on this case for 3 months.
we're out of our jurisdiction.
Sheriff and CHP are on the Way.
Do Whatever you're going to do.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Jesus!
He's crazy!
Shit!
Glad you could drop In.
Like jewelry?
Fuck you!
I prefer blondes.
Do the honors.
-Captain.
-What's going on?
Letting the locals do their thing.
You blew out the truck window.
-Two guys are in the road.
-I noticed.
-We're out of our jurisdiction here.
-True.
-What's going on?
-I heard a rumor about this truck.
-What about it?
-It's not a truck.
It's a gas truck.
It's a major moving violation.
Check the first panel?
Full of gas.
We checked the whole truck!
There's nothing in it!
You're out of your neighborhood,
city boy!
I want your badge and weapon!
I want your ass!
Who do you think you are?!
He thinks he's Rambo.
Rambo. . .
. . .Is a pussy.
What do you know, It's snowing!
Anybody want to get high?
I'll be damned!
Not bad for a city guy.
Ray Tango.
He's done it to us again.
If it isn't Tango, it's Cash.
Tango and Cash!
Cash and Tango!
These two cops are driving me crazy.
We must do something about this.
I agree. I would like
to handle this myself, Mr. Perret.
No, we will handle it.
No.
Not that way.
I have something else in mind.
Hey, Cash!
Armani with a badge!
Look out!
Police business!
This is my car!
Move!
What are you doing to my car?!
Son of a bitch!
What's wrong?
Got a headache?
You crazy!
What did you do with my car?!
I believe in perestroika !
Welcome to America!
Tango, I saw your picture in the paper.
Ray, Look at this.
Blind luck!
-Catherine's in your office.
-That's great!
You just don't take off. . .
. . .on the spur of the moment. It's--
What?
Illogical?
-Very!
-It's not that big a deal.
I'll be gone a month or two.
It takes that Long to build a house,
not take a vacation.
A dance tour is not a vacation!
I just want to get away.
You have all you need in this town.
Grime, crime and slime.
No, thanks. I 'd rather go.
Okay, but give me the phone numbers
so I can reach you.
Why don't I call you?
Why don't you call me?
Catherine, If you feel stressed,
don't run away.
Stay and we'll deal with this together.
Don't make me feel guilty.
I just need some time alone, okay?
I promise, Lieutenant,
to be a good girl.
There It Is!
The key word.
''Good. ''
You're telling me you'll be good
because you know. . .
. . .automatically, I think you'll be bad.
What's a margin call?
Why?
Your stockbroker's on Line 3.
Don't Leave.
Hold on.
I have a plane to catch.
Catherine, don't go.
Think positive.
Shit!
Harvey, It's me.
-It's good you wore a vest.
-Hardly needed It with these.
Half-Load soft Lead slugs.
This guy was reality sloppy.
Look at this.
This shirt cost $9.
Get me a new vest, okay?
Whoa, pizza!
Who was fucking with my gun?
The sight's shifted.
-Maybe you dropped It.
-I didn't drop It.
Captain!
Get anything out of him?
No, he doesn't speak English.
Our Interpreter says he wants a Lawyer.
Let me question him.
The guy who just tried
to bow you away? Forget It!
Stay away from him, Gabe.
So, you don't know any English?
I don't know Chinese, so we'll have to
give you a crash course.
But I got a feeling
you'll be a quick Learner.
Come here. Sit down.
This Is Lesson number one.
The next Lessons get harder.
Who hired you?
I think he's one of Quan's men.
I don't know his name.
I swear!
Look at that, Flattop.
You're speaking Like a native already.
-What Is this?
-English 1 01 .
Your scumbag Lawyer
won't be here for a whine.
Is there anything you want to share?
A deal. Tonight.
. . .Front Street. 9:00.
Very good.
My compliments.
Pretty good for your first Lesson.
Don't forget to wash your hands.
There's a big bust going down,
-Is that reliable?
-Yes. A phone tap.
-Fantastic.
-What Is this?
Downtown crown
versus Beverly Hills wop.
-All the news that's fit to print.
-I don't get you.
You make a shipload of money.
Why do you do this?
Action.
Good old American action.
If you want to stare death In the eye,
get married.
Is that a proposal?
Gabriel Cash.
How many millions?
How many?
How many this time?
Oh, God!
Ray Tango!
He Loves to dance.
He waltzes In and takes all my drugs. . .
. . .and then Tangos out again.
I've had enough.
Too much television. . .
. . .can hurt your eyes.
Now do you see why we can't kill them?
No.
I do not see.
It would be much quicker.
And easier.
Quicker. . .
. . .and easier.
That's how you make a cake.
Or clean a toilet bowl, or shop. . .
. . .by mail.
But It's not how to run a
multi-million-dollar business Like ours.
Mr. Quan.
On the east side. . .
. . .your part of the city. . .
. . .Gabriel Cash. . .
. . .has cost me $60 million. . .
. . .Including guns, drugs and other
enterprises. On the west side. . .
. . .Mr. Lopez. . .
. . .Ray Tango. . .
. . .has cost me even more.
Two Little mice. . .
. . .and so much damage.
But If we kill them,
we risk all-out war with the police.
They're heroes already.
Why make martyrs of them?
Instead of death. . .
. . .we have a game.
A game that only we can win.
Within two weeks. . .
. . .I will take delivery of the Largest
shipment of weapons that. . .
. . .we have ever handled.
Within that time. . .
. . .Tango. . .
. . .and Cash. . .
. . .will be safely tucked away. . .
. . .behind bars.
Aren't they beautiful?
You almost got yourself killed, pal.
It's the other way around.
I Pull this trigger,
your throat's hanging off that wall.
Pull that trigger,
I'll blow you In half.
You never had a chance
to hit me with that gun.
Not this one.
You know me?
You're L.A.'s second-best cop.
I heard the same about you.
-Stay off my case.
-Your case?
I've been on It 3 months.
Then you're stupid. I've been on It
-Stay off my case.
-Nice tie!
How do you want to do this?
I'll go first. Cover me on three.
One.
-Two.
-Three.
Freak!
What's the score?
My turn.
Don't move!
Don't move your hands.
His hands aren't going anywhere.
Do the honors.
He's wired.
This Is all wrong!
-You ought to be a cop.
-Did you expect this?
No, I didn't,
and I didn't expect you, either.
Why Is he wired?
Got me. Good luck getting anything
out of him. But this is your show...
. . .so I'm gone. Ciao, babe.
Drop your weapons!
-Freeze!
-We're cops!
Wait! We're on the same team!
Just read this, damn It!
I'm going to blow
both your fucking brains out!
-No problem.
-I'm convinced.
He's hysterical.
-I'd Like a receipt for that.
-Me, too.
We can talk about this.
That's my gun.
What's It doing here?
That gun was In my Locker.
It's not your gun now!
It's evidence.
-Why's your gun here?
-They stole It.
Tell me what you did.
I don't know this man.
I didn't come with him.
So with your permission,
I'll be Leaving. Ciao.
You didn't come with him,
but you're Leaving with him.
You're making a mistake.
You're going down for this.
Get these bastards out of here!
Now!
-You're bad karma.
-I hope you got a good Lawyer.
Perret says use this tape.
-Did Tango shoot a federal officer?
-No comment.
Was Cash there too?
No comment.
what do they have?
They got a .380
with Cash's fingerprints.
They think It's the murder weapon.
Ballistics Is checking It.
They were at the scene of the crime.
No one was seen coming or going.
What else?
The tape Is ready.
What tape?
-Show us the money.
-/It's in the suitcase.
-Open it.
-/It's all there.
-Count it if you Want to.
- we Want to.
where's the stuff?
Right here.
Direct from the police lockup.
You know, / like dealing With cops.
/t restores my low opinion
of human nature.
/n that case, you'll love this.
Lts. Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash,
two highly-decorated officers...
...go on trial today...
...for slaying an undercover agent
during a sting operation.
Tango and Cash insist...
...they are victims of a
setup by criminal figures...
...aimed at taking the two cops
out of action.
Expert Witnesses Will lead off
the prosecution's case.
Mr. Skinner, you've heard the tapes.
Can you make a judgment
about Its authenticity?
I have no reason to believe
It Isn't genuine.
How did you test this tape?
I took samples of the suspects. . .
. . .comparing them to the tape
with an oscilloscope.
They matched.
When this Is over, remind me
to rip his tongue out.
With a tow truck.
When I entered the premises,
I saw the two suspects, the guns. . .
. . .the money, the drugs, the dead body.
When those guys showed up. . .
. . .I figured It's all gone sour.
I was going to go and clear
everything up. . .
. . .when they killed him.
When this Is over,
Let's pay Jabba the Hutt a visit.
I 'll bring the chain saw.
I'll bring the beer.
Detective Cash assaulted me.
He put a chair on me and sat on It.
I couldn't find a piano.
This bastard can speak English!
The squarecrow can talk!
Squarecrow?
What do you call It?
As the attorneys for Tango
and Cash left the courtroom...
...their mood can only
be described as grim.
They face an uphill battle...
...if not an impossible one.
Ray, somebody set you up good.
I feel we should cop a plea.
You can guarantee minimum security?
Absolutely. That will be the deal.
Does Cash's attorney agree?
If he's smart, he does.
I want to talk to Cash.
I need to work on my
statement for the court.
What do you want?
First, to say I'm not fond of your kind.
What kind Is that?
You're a glory hound and a hot dog.
That stings.
Tell me when the critique Is over.
It's over.
-My Lawyer wants me to cop a plea.
-Mine, too. 1 8 months.
Lompoc Country Club.
The gym opens at 5 a.m.
You can start pumping early.
-Who set us up?
-I don't know.
I got a Lot of admirers. You?
A few.
Look, If we cop a plea,
we cop It together.
You mean that your Lawyer
wanted you to make a deal. . .
. . .but you didn't want to Leave this
glory hound holding the bag, right?
-Right.
-What a generous guy!
-I'll make the statement.
-I will.
No way. You'll screw It up.
When's your birthday?
When were you born?
-Why?
-Day and month.
-You want to do my horoscope?
-Just give me the month.
-May.
-February.
I got seniority.
I'll make the statement.
August 1 6.
I read your records. That's when you
were hatched. August 1 6.
I got seniority.
All rise.
The court Is now In session.
The Honorable
Judge McCormack presiding.
Be seated.
Your Honor.
The defendants wish
to change their plea.
Order!
Very well, counselor.
What Is the plea?
Your Honor, may I approach the bench?
Proceed, Mr. Tango.
It's okay.
Your Honor, I've been
a policeman for 1 2 years.
I think It's the best organization
In the country.
I've been told I'm too aggressive
In capturing criminals.
If that Is a sin. . .
. . .I'm guilty.
I've aways worked with good cops.
You are.
They're doing a tough job.
I only hope that with this trial,
the whole department. . .
. . .Is not judged by what has transpired.
Thank you.
Not bad.
Have you anything to add, Mr. Cash?
-Yeah.
-No!
Mr. Tango has spoken very eloquently.
I wish I could be as forgiving.
But I can't, because. . .
. . .this whole thing. . .
. . .fucking sucks!
This Is a pile of shit!
Your Honor!
Order!
Order!
Be seated, Mr. Cash.
Your Honor, the defendants
wish to plead no contest. . .
. . .to a charge of
voluntary manslaughter.
This Is part of an agreement?
Yes. The state
recommends a sentence. . .
. . .of not more than 1 8 months
In a minimum-security facility.
Mr. Cash, Mr. Tango, do you
enter this plea of your own free will?
Yes, sir.
The agreement Is
acceptable to the court.
The defense and the state
will deliver the proper documentation.
Court Is adjourned.
Now that Tango and Cash
are behind bars. . .
. . .you needn't be afraid anymore.
What's wrong, gentlemen?
You don't share my enthusiasm.
Mr. Perret, I am sorry. . .
. . .but I cannot appreciate
these games you keep paying.
Forgive me for asking, Mr. Perret. . .
. . .but what happens In 1 8 months
when they get out?
Use your Imagination.
What makes you think
they'll ever get out again?
Now go take care of your business.
I got a feeling this Is
going to be a great year.
Ever hear of shock absorbers?
Welcome to Club Fed.
What a vacation!
End of the Line. Get out.
You, this way!
What do you have to say now, genius?
I don't think there's
a golf course here.
Make yourselves
at home sweet home, boys.
This Is a mistake, right?
My underwear Is riding Into my throat.
They're not there?!
They were on the bus!
I'm trying to trace them.
They were transferred
off the bus near Victorville.
We got to find them.
Your underwear problem Is solved.
I noticed. You can stop
holding In your stomach.
Come on! Somebody bribed the
prison board! That's why we're here!
They're as crooked as
everybody else In this deal.
I'll Tell you one thing.
Whoever set us up Is fucking connected.
Do you think It's Quan?
Thanks.
No, wait! I got It!
It's Lopez!
Lopez! Follow me through here.
Lopez has a guy pretend
to try and kill me. . .
. . .and claim that Quan hired him.
He feeds me bogus Information
about the setup.
Lopez figures, no matter what,
I'll think It was Quan.
All the time It's Lopez,
and now I know It.
What do you think?
That with your I.Q., you're unarmed
and still very dangerous.
If you're so smart, Tell me
who set us up, Sherlock Holmes.
-I don't know yet.
-You don't know shit!
What are you doing?
Relax.
Soap.
Don't flatter yourself.
Peewee.
I don't know you that well.
Don't worry.
Someday the other one will drop.
You just keep talking, tripod!
Sure, Minnie Mouse!
By the way. . .
. . .I bet they stick us
In the general population.
They don't put cops
In general population.
Never put cops In
general population, huh?
Cash, I'll Light your fucking bowels!
I'll stick brown sugar up your ass!
Shit, I put half these guys away.
Tango, you're going to be my bitch!
I'll kick your fucking ass!
You know what I hate?
-Litter.
-Goddamn It!
I forgot the marshmallows.
I don't think rehabilitation
Is working here.
They're just misunderstood.
Cops!
Bring them to me!
Bring them to me!
Cops! Cops!
Bring them here!
Come here!
I want to talk to you.
Hey, punk!
When I get out of here,
I'll tear you a new ass.
You know Captain Dynaball here?
I Loved you In Conan the Barbarian.
If you need me, me and my ass
will be In the neighborhood.
You fucking pig! It's over for you!
You're going to be very popular here.
Funny, I don't see
your fan cub, either.
That crapper Is mine!
And what am I supposed to use?
I don't give a shit!
Just don't use that.
Okay, bud. We're going to
get one thing straight right now.
That Is yours!
Would you mind stopping that?
Thank you.
I appreciate It.
I'm not afraid of you.
See that?
I killed him.
Congratulations.
He was my best friend.
Crazy people fear no one.
Look at that!
Sugar Is up. I cannot believe this!
Let's dance, Tango!
Come on, Cash!
Get the bag on him!
Kill him!
Kill the fucker!
You're dead meat, Tango!
They got you?
What's It Look Like?
Let me guess.
The welcoming committee.
Either that or a surprise party.
Don't make a move.
We'll talk our way out.
I doubt they're Into smart talk.
If we panic, we're history.
The Infamous. . .
. . .Cash and Tango.
Dishonored, Imprisoned.
A shameful fall from glory!
Who are you?
Just think of me as somebody who. . .
. . .doesn't Like you much.
The surprise party Is out.
Shit! That's the guy
I followed to the setup.
Don't panic.
Tarty Tango!
You're a pretty boy, aren't you?
I'm panicking.
How would you Like me
to change It for you?
-I wouldn't.
-How about you?
Maybe you first.
Don't panic.
I'll cut your throat,
yank your tongue out the hole. . .
. . .and tie It In a Windsor knot.
-I don't wear ties.
-Brave boy!
You want to cut my throat?!
Go ahead!
You want to cut off my head?
You can bowl with It!
Just don't Let him do It!
I don't want to get killed. . .
. . .by this limey jerk-off!
I want to get killed
by an American jerk-off!
You wanker!
Put It away for now.
Just for now.
Some of your other friends
want to say hello first.
What are you doing?
-Buying time.
-For what?
I don't know yet.
Shit, It's Conan.
-We'll get FUBAR now.
-What's FUBAR?
You'll see.
Real bad-ass cops!
You don't Look so tough now.
Do you, you fuck?!
He means you.
This pig and his cop friends. . .
. . .broke my ribs, my Leg and my jaw.
You broke that jaw?
He deserved It.
Why did you do that?
Why? I was having a bad day!
Like now?
Don't panic!
Rats In a maze. . .
. . .men. . .
. . .In a cage.
Place your bets!
Which broke survives?
Who's brave?
Who fries first?
Cook, you bastard!
Tango, you got any family?
Yeah. You?
I go steady with an alimony check.
First, Mr. Cash.
No, don't do It.
Cash!
Cash!
Fuck you.
Tango?
Get them down!
Off the scaffold!
Lock this place down!
Shit!
You fight this one. I'm burned out.
You Look Like hell, Cash.
Matt, Is It reality you?
It Is.
Am I glad to see you!
My arm.
-Who's he?
-Matt Sokowski, assistant warden.
My C.O. when I was a rookie.
You guys are In deep shit.
Really?
Who set you up?
I think we just met him.
If this creep wants us dead so bad,
why doesn't he shoot us?
Why play this game?
He has a boring nightlife.
-How'd he get In?
-Anything can happen here.
All you need Is cash.
We have the best guards money can buy.
You got the bucks,
you get what you need.
Once you're back In
general population, they'll nail you.
You got only one choice: escape.
Escape?
I'll get a spoon and start tunneling. . .
. . .and you can chew through the bars.
This Is bullshit!
What's with him?
He's upset. He misses his wardrobe.
What do we do?
Listen, I got a plan worked out.
We trust him?
We've known each other 1 5 years.
-We trusted our Lawyers.
-And the judge.
And that got us nowhere.
Now trust me.
Now that Is a risky proposition.
I got a present for you.
You're unbelievable!
I do miss my wardrobe.
This Is the ventilation system.
Enter It from
the utility shaft In the yard.
This main ventilation shaft
Leads beyond the wall.
I can shut down one fan
and Leave this door unlocked.
I'll get you the right work detail
and Leave tools at the shaft.
This way Looks faster.
-No, It's Longer.
-Let's stick to plan A.
Let's get you to the Infirmary.
Why your plan A?
It's better than your plan B,
which you don't even have.
Not yet, but I will.
My partner In pain.
Sokowski got us trash detail. Let's go.
Whoopee! Race you to the dumpster.
It's set for now. Come on.
Negative.
I'm not going.
Did you have a brain meltdown?
Look, I have an aversion
to getting FUBAR.
-What's FUBAR?
-''Fucked up beyond all recognition. ''
I don't trust Sokowski!
He's a cop, for Chrissake!
What's this?
My fiancée, Slinky.
Up, Slinky.
Let's see how business Is.
You are one mistrustful,
maladjusted human fucking being!
I Love you, too.
I'm not coming back for you.
You're making a big mistake.
You don't have to.
Hope you make It, Cash.
Let's go, you're Late!
I hope you and Cousin It. . .
. . .are very happy together. . .
. . .and raise a beautiful Litter.
Ciao.
Ciao.
You're half an hour Late, asshole!
I'm doing my best, boss.
Matt!
There he Is!
Let's go!
Out of my way!
-What are you doing here?
-I got lonely.
I can't hold It all day!
Shit!
Come on, Cash!
This way!
Move It!
Your friend Matt waltzed you
Into a trap!
How could you be so stupid?
Matt's dead.
They cut his throat ear to ear.
Ponytail!
This Is the way.
You'll Like this.
It's the best ride In the park.
This way!
-Know where you're going?
-Absolutely.
-Sure you know where you're going?
-Yes, exactly!
Then get your ass up there!
Come on!
-This Is the only way?
-No.
We can go back.
Let's go!
This way!
-You sure this Is the way?
-Exactly!
