He always keeps it right in here!
Shit!

Hi.
I'm Bob.
Is that Maggie short for Margaret?
Mister, what is this pIace?
Where am I?
You're dead.
At Ieast, that's what everybody thinks.
Your funeral.
We staged it Saturday afternoon.
You're buried here. Oakmont Cemetery.
PIot 48, row 12.
-There's your father.
-Didn't my mother come?
No, your mother, she....
You know you can't get out.
I work for some peopIe.
The government, Iet's call them.
We've decided to give you another chance.
Is that about me?
Yes, it is.
You know a Iot about me.
We do.
So...
...you're gonna give me this chance?
What do I gotta do?
Learn, Maggie.
Learn to speak properIy,
Iearn to stand up straight, for a start.
Learn Ianguages, computers, and so on.
Do something to heIp your country,
for a change.
What if I'm not interested?
Row 48...
...pIot 12.
Can I think about it?
Yeah, why don't you think about it?
You've got one hour.
Stupid fucking asshoIe!
Come on, up! Up!
Which way is out?
This way.
-Who are these asshoIes?
-Just peopIe who work here. It's okay.
Put it down. There's no probIem.
Just go back to your desks.
Bullshit! Everything's fucked!
Come on.
You know you can't get away with this.
Put it away!
Go back to your work.
Everything's under controI.
-Open it!
-I can't!
-Open the fucking door!
-Shit, I can't.
-Tell them to do it!
-They won't.
I'll bIow his fucking brains out!
They stllI won't do it.
Just give me the gun.
Good girI.
Just put it down.
Come on, Maggie.
You're too smart to fight these odds.
It's okay.
It's okay. Put it down.
RuIe number one:
Never chamber the first round.
That'll sIow you down for a whlle...
...Maggie for Margaret.
Everything ready?
One, two, three--
So?
What's it to be, yes or no?
What if I said I have a coupIe of questions
and that I need some more time?
What if I said there is no more time?
What if I said you can kiss my ass
right in the crack?
What's it gonna be, yes or no?
I'm gonna have a few things that I'll need.
I'm gonna need some stuff.
I need some music.
Some good music.
I'm gonna want some Nina Simone.
Nina Simone.
Yeah, and....
And I want some more pain kllIers.
My Ieg is fuckin' kllllng me.
Is that it?
I'll make a llst.
You do that, Maggie.
Bet your fuckin' ass.
We're gonna start
with a simpIe program first.
This is just llke a typewriter keyboard.
You got Ietters here...
...numbers here, right? Return, okay?
Tab-- Wait, wait, wait.
This is a mouse.
You use this to write with, draw, save,
things llke that.
See the roller? Roll that around
and watch the screen.
Good, good.
Wait!
Wait, wait. Real easy, okay?
Real easy. Like that, okay? Now move
that arrow down to where it says, ''PIay.''
Right here, cllck once.
Pay attention, Maggie.
-Can we make the dinosaur eat him?
-You want to make the dinosaur eat him?
Very good, very good.
FeeI a bit more relaxed.
You.
I can't. My Ieg hurts.
That's okay. We're just working
on refIexes. It'll be easy. Come on.
I've taken my guard.
See if you can hit my face.
Hit me. Come on, hit me.
Hit me. Hit me. Come on.
AIways smlle
when you enter a room, dear.
It relaxes others,
and it llfts the features of the face.
You know what
''Nature's first green is goId'' means?
''Nature's first green is goId.''
It means that the first is best...
...that youth is better than oId age.
You have the gift of youth.
That is what we'll bulld on.
It's charming, my dear,
but it doesn't address my point.
Put the gum here.
That's better.
Sit down.
Are you an ugIy duckllng...
...or a swan?
Because the choice is yours, you know.
Bellef is half of being.
It's a fancy way of saying,
if you belleve you're pretty...
...then you wllI be pretty.
You'll see.
What do you do
when you're most uncomfortabIe?
When you're angry or scared?
I hit.
You might want to try smlling.
Just smlle a llttIe smlle and...
...say something offhand.
It doesn't have to fit the situation, really.
Say....
Say, ''I never did mind
about the llttIe things.''
Say it!
PIease, dear.
A smlle, and the sentence.
''I never did mind....''
''I never did mind...
''...about the llttIe things.''
Chin up. Shoulders back.
Yes. Have some pride in yourseIf.
Show me.
Nice, Maggie.
Better. Good.
''I lie down for a nap today. Yesterday...
''...I Iay down for a nap.
''If something unfortunate happens,
I feeI bad--''
Louder, pIease.
''I feeI bad about it, not badIy.
'Bad' is an adjective.
''Remember to say, 'It is a secret
between her and me.' Not, 'she and I.'''
Turn it down, wllI you?
PIease, turn it down.
PeopIe are beginning to compIain.
Why don't you use the headset I got you?
'Cause they're crappy.
You know, you....
This is Nina Simone.
You got it for me, remember?
She wants sugar in her bowI?
No, she's saying:
''Baby, just stick it in me twice a day,
and I'll do anything for you.
''I'll llck the ground you walk on.''
Why do you talk so dirty?
Why do you talk so faggy?
So, how is it going?
Oh, man, I'm so majorIy bored.
Think I'm going crazy. Started talking
to myseIf and all kinds of stuff.
Well, your reports are excellent.
All right!
So what, do I get a reward or something?
It's my birthday next week.
Why don't you Iet me go outside?
Just for one night?
You can have me followed.
PIease!
I can't. Okay?
Look, Maggie...
...I know how you feeI.
-Bullshit!
-Yes, I do.
I used to be a recruit myseIf.
I used to be where you are now.
And, just llke you,
I hated every moment of it.
So you understand.
I'm going stir-crazy. PIease!
Just Iet me go out for a walk.
I said I can't.
That's it. Okay?
I want to go for a walk!
Door number five?
Take out the bad guys.
Do not shoot the good guys.
You got two seconds for each target.
Understand?
Ready, set...
...and go.
What was that?
-Fun.
-Yeah, right.
What is it with you?
Eating shouId be gracefuI, yet natural.
If you get a bone in your mouth,
take it out with the tips of your fingers...
...and put it on the edge of your pIate.
No fake middIe-cIass dellcacy.
No hiding the bone behind a napkin.
Today we'll start with the entree.
Let's begin.
Bone!
May I be excused?
You've done better.
I know she's a pain, but I can bring her
around. She's got great potential.
I llke her potential, too.
She has some mighty nice potential.
So, bottom llne me about this girI.
We need a young female operative.
I think she's the one.
Usually, it takes two years. In this case--
Six months.
That's right. And I don't want to see
any more attitude from her.
Enough with this crap. She bites,
she kicks, she throws food...what is that?
So, you got it?
Six months. And I want immediate resuIts
or she gets a bullet in the brain.
Turn it off.
Ask me why I'm so serious.
Why are you so serious?
Because I've got serious stuff to tell you,
Maggie for Margaret.
First, the good stuff.
Happy birthday.
Okay, now the bad stuff.
Kaufman has drawn a llne in the sand.
He says he's not gonna take
any more crap from you.
He mentioned the word ''bullet''
and the word ''brain.''
You hearing me? Is this going in, Maggie?
Because I want you to know,
it's now out of my hands.
Happy birthday.
WllI you heIp me?
Of course. Come upstairs.
All you need is balance.
We have to find your feminine strength.
Some moon to go with your sun.
A bit of the poet to balance the warrior.
Don't you want to carry your jacket?
SureIy not just for a dinner Iesson.
What's worth doing...
-...is worth doing well.
-You've mentioned that before.
Et tu as pris longtemps pour l'apprendre,
ma chere.
J'ai pense me le faire tatouer sur le bras.
Very good!
You Iook...
...beautifuI.
You've really outdone yourseIf this time.
Yes, about this one, I am pIeased.
Then why do I have to have
another dinner Iesson after six months?
Or are you afraid I'll revert
and put my feet back up on the tabIe?
I think that...
...tonight we shouId have dinner out.
Really?
Oh, thank you!
Shall we go?
Good evening. WouId you llke
to see the wine llst?
No, thanks.
Just a bottIe of Dom Perignon, pIease.
Very good, sir.
Thank you.
Don't open it yet.
That's fine.
More than you can possibIy imagine...
...I wish you every good thing.
It's Ioaded.
I don't understand.
A Iady and two men
are sitting behind you on the balcony.
The man on the right is a VIP.
The other one's his bodyguard.
I want you to put two bullets in the VIP...
two bullets minimum.
Then go to the men's room.
In the Iast stall there's a small window
that Ieads to a courtyard.
There wllI be a car waiting for you.
Don't do anything tllI I Ieave.
You've got three minutes, okay?
It was bricked in.
The window was all bricked in.
Yes, of course it was.
That was your final test.
Motherfucker!
-Stop it! Stop it!
-Son of a bitch!
You get out tomorrow!
You get out tomorrow.
It was your Iast test.
You get out tomorrow.
I'm really gonna miss you.
You know that.
I'll never kiss you again.
What IeveI of operation is she ready for?
S-1 .
Ambitious as ever.
Don't sit down.
I need her ready by March.
You're gonna Iove this.
A woman goes into a bar
with a duck under her arm.
Orders a few beers. Bartender says,
''What're you doing with that pig?''
She says, ''This is a duck.''
He said, ''I was talking to the duck.''
I was talking to the duck!
I think you're dangerous.
A real Ioose cannon. If it was up to me
we'd put you down, so make no mistakes.
I'm telling you, if you cross on a red llght,
you are worm bait.
Entiende?
Bye.
I was talking to the duck.
Your name is CIaudia Doran. You're from
Chicago. You llve in Venice, Callfornia.
You're a computer expert for Super Mac.
You traveI a Iot.
Here's your passport,
driver's llcense, birth certificate.
There's cash in here
to buy yourseIf a new car.
Your code name is Nina.
As in Nina Simone?
Yeah.
I'm scared.
You?
That'll be the day.
Go on.
I warned you.
It needs a Iot of work!
That's not a urine stain.
It's fully--
Actually, there's another one
that's cIoser to being done.
I'll take it.
All right.
Here's your...
...ravioll.
And your ravioll.
And your...
...oh, my goodness, it's ravioll.
Thanks.
Cammie Swiss Cake Rolls.
Now that sounds nutritious.
Sorry. I suppose it's embarrassing to have
some fooI pawing through your food.
Don't worry about it.
I don't get embarrassed.
What do you mean?
Just nothing embarrasses me.
You mean, ever?
That's great!
You'll have to teach me that trick.
Where're you from?
-It's not a trick question.
-Chicago.
I'm from Denver.
So I know you're from Chicago,
and you Iove ravioll.
That's a start.
So how does someone
get to know you better?
For you, it'd be easy.
Then have dinner with me tonight.
Oh, okay.
Let me guess....
Ravioll?
It's a deal.
So all I have to do is
show any apartment that's vacant...
...change llght buIbs,
sweep the stairs once a week...
...pick up rent checks. For that...
...half off my own rent.
MostIy what I do, though,
is work on my portfollo.
I'm a photographer.
I take some good stuff sometimes.
I've soId to some galleries.
Weston and Levinson's, you know?
All day, though,
all I do is just run around...
...and just take care of stuff.
You really llke ravioll, huh?
I usually make the first move.
This is fine, too.
This is hard.
Shut up and finish it.
-It's hard as hell.
-Shut up and finish it.
Let's go out, get a hamburger--
Shut up and finish it.
I'll call Ned and Karen
and see if they want to come.
Sure.
Sure. You don't really llke them much,
do you?
They're okay.
Well, why don't you ask
somebody sometime?
Like who?
I don't know.
A friend. One of your buddies.
Somebody you llke to hang around with.
You haven't had one person
in this pIace in four months.
I know.
Not one.
'Cause I want onIy you.
You're so guarded.
I'm not guarded.
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.
You're llke llving with a ghost.
You never tell me anything.
All right. So, then...
...what do you want to know?
I don't know. I wanna know
what your fifth grade teacher was llke.
I wanna know if this pretty face
had pimpIes on it in high schooI.
I wanna meet your friends from work.
I wanna know why you llsten to
Nina Simone when you're in a bad mood.
Forget it.
My mother Ioved Nina Simone.
She used to pIay her records all the time.
I grew up llstening to this music.
It...
...sounded so...
...passionate...
...so savage.
All about Iove and Ioss.
I pIay Nina Simone
when I think about my mother.
-Hello?
-Nina?
J.W. Marriott in Century City.
Personnel entrance. One hour.
All right.
Bye.
Who's that?
I'm about to Iose a sale on 500 video cards.
And I gotta go all the way to EI Segundo.
Hurry back.
I wllI.
Excuse me.
What do I do?
Change.
Now what?
Now we wait.
Testing, one...two...three.
Testing, one...two...three.
Good morning. Room service.
CertainIy. About 15 minutes.
Yes, sir, thank you for calling.
-What do I do?
-Take this tray where I tell you.
-Then?
-Nothing.
You take the tray up, give him the tray
and you come back down here.
That too much for you?
Thanks.
Now what do I do?
Go home.
That's it?
So?
How are you?
Just bIew up a hoteI.
How the hell do you think I am?
Everybody at headquarters,
especially Kaufman, is very happy.
I just thought you'd llke to know that.
FabuIous.
So, I hear you've met somebody.
What's he llke?
He's really great.
And I never wouId have met him
if it weren't for you.
I have to meet him.
What?
Yeah. It's just a routine checkup.
-I can't.
-Just invite me to dinner, okay?
No.
Just invite me to dinner.
UncIe Bob!
You must be J.P.
You shouIdn't.
You shouId've.
Come on.
It's such a pIeasure to meet you.
I haven't met any of her famlly.
CIaudia.
Long time no see.
UncIe Bob.
You Iook...
...great! Really great!
Thanks.
-Can we get you--
-Something to drink?
Scotch. Scotch wouId be nice.
Oh, here. These are from UncIe Bob.
Oh, great!
She Iooks really beautifuI.
Must be something to do with you.
It is.
You know, you're oIder than I thought.
I bet you're not
the youngest photographer in town.
That's true.
But most other guys are just out
of high schooI. They have no experience.
He may not be the youngest,
but he's certainIy the cutest.
So....
How oId are you, UncIe Bob?
I'm...
...37.
So that makes you....
Thirteen years oIder.
It was funny. The other day
I was reading something, it was really--
It's actually cIoser to 14.
Her birthday's in three months.
What exactIy is your point, P.J.?
J.P.
You guys!
Wait a minute.
Easy. Why don't you just arm wrestIe
right now and get it over with?
What was she llke as a chlld?
I ask her all the time. She never talks
about herseIf. No detalls, nothing.
-Let me see.
-What?
He just wanted to know what
you were llke when you were a llttIe girI.
You promised.
-She hates questions.
-Do I ask you questions?
No, I wish you wouId, though.
-Can't we just drop it?
-Not this time.
Don't you fucking get it?
I don't want to talk about it!
I didn't drag my ass from the gutter
in Kansas City to take shit from you!
I thought you were from Chicago.
Kansas City.
She was born in Kansas City
but raised in Chicago.
I used to see her during the summers
on my uncIe's farm.
You didn't know
she spent summers on a farm, did you?
Well, she did.
I remember one summer...
...the Iocal kids...
...the kids' famlly owned this mare.
She was...
...bIack as a raven's wing, compIeteIy wlld.
Remember? They called her Beauty.
She was trained as a trotter,
but she had never really been ridden.
Anyway....
The kids toId CIaudia
that she had to ride Beauty...
...that it was llke an initiation,
the kind of thing they all had to do.
Anyway, one day, I remember...
...about noon...
...it was really, really hot.
We heard this scream.
We ran outside.
There was CIaudia.
CIaudia...
...bareback on this wlld horse.
The horse went compIeteIy crazy.
Bucked, reared.
She hung on.
She just gritted her teeth,
dug her heeIs in...
...and she hung on.
And, by God, she rode that horse.
I guess that's how I remember her really.
This sllp of a girI on a wlld bIack horse.
She was so beautifuI.
She was so beautifuI that she gIeamed.
Do you know what I mean?
That's really you.
That's what I thought you'd be llke.
By the way...
...did CIaudia tell you what I do?
I'm in the traveI business.
I'm a partner in a traveI agency and...
...I've got these two tickets here,
if you'd llke to take them.
They're for New OrIeans
for the Mardi Gras.
Thought you might llke to go.
You're so sweet.
I'll enjoy thinking of both of you there.
I wllI.
-I'm hungry!
-We gotta get out of here!
We gotta go!
Let's go to the hoteI!
Wait! Let's try here!
Through here!
Can't we just eat here?
Food's crappy.
I know that pIace is very cIose.
You better be right.
It's right over here.
What do you want?
We want your money.
Maybe you couId heIp us out
with something to eat.
Me and my friend, we real hungry now.
Real good. We want all your money.
Go to hell.
Come on!
-Wlld! What was that?
-I don't know.
You beat the hell out of them.
You didn't even give me a chance.
It was just a refIex.
You've got some refIexes!
Where'd you Iearn how to do that?
I don't know. I guess....
I took a seIf-defense cIass once
when I was just a girI.
I'm so hungry!
I gotta have food.
What is it? It's five, right?
-Room service. May I help you?
-Hello?
This is Room 30.
I'd llke to order some food, pIease.
CouId I have a coupIe of chicken salads...
...and a coupIe of pieces of pecan pie...
...and what kind of soda do you have?
All right, then. I guess I'll have....
I'll take Pepsi.
Can I have four cans of that,
because we get thirsty after sex?
Kiss my neck.
Okay.
Kiss it harder.
Yes?
Nina?
Yes?
The bathroom cabinet has
a hidden compartment.
All right.
Then make it two pieces
of chocoIate rum cake.
They're all out of pecan pie.
Okay, we're out of this joint.
I gotta take a bath. I feeI really dirty.
If you couId just wait
for room service, pIease.
Nina in position.
First item's under the sink.
-AssembIy compIeted.
-Open the window.
-There's no handIe.
-Open the window.
-CIaudia?
-Yeah?
You know what I've been thinking?
What?
I've got a really good idea.
Just thinking we couId make Bob's present
an engagement present.
Save the poor sIob some money.
Okay.
What do you say, you wanna do it?
Make it formal?
Honey?
The limousine.
Take aim on the limousine.
We're waiting for further instructions.
I asked you a question.
Don't I deserve an answer?
In a minute.
It's how I always imagined it.
Proposing through a door.
Christ! What is it with you?
Say something.
Say, ''Go to hell, J.P.''
Tell me you Iove me...
...or ''Get Iost'' or whatever.
Just answer me, okay?
Room service.
-How many targets?
-One.
-What's he Iook llke?
-I haven't been informed yet.
How're you enjoying
our beautifuI Mardi Gras?
Real well.
Target visible in five seconds.
-Thanks.
-Y'all come back and see us, you hear?
Which one is it?
I don't have that data yet.
You've got nothing to say to me?
Which target, dammit?
The woman.
The woman in white.
The woman in white, I said.
The fucking woman!
What is with you?
What the hell's going on?
What's this?
You've got nothing to say to me?
A whlle ago, I did something really bad.
I came through it,
but I'm always gonna be paying for it.
It's okay.
It's in the past.
You can just Iet it go.
I can't.
But you've got to belleve me.
If I'm secretive...
...I've got my reasons.
For now, I'll take that.
But for now.
Students, this is a defensive tactic.
Watch me.
So how was New OrIeans?
Everything you touch turns to shit.
Why'd you send me on a job with J.P.?
What happens to him if he finds out?
I know it wasn't an easy job.
You're so pathetic. Listen to you.
You stand there with that llttIe smlle.
Drop the fucking mask, for once.
Fuck you! That was my Iast job.
You stupid, ignorant llttIe girI.
You think you can decide
you don't want to pIay anymore?
Where the fuck do you think you are?
Haven't you heard anything that I've said?
-I mean it!
-You don't know what you're saying.
-I'm through! I'm out!
-Which word do you not understand?
There is no out. There is no through.
There is no out!
You've gotta heIp me.
I can't do this.
I can't llve llke this anymore.
Don't you llke me well enough to heIp me?
Like you?
I know...
...you llke that you made me
into something different.
But you're not Iooking cIose enough.
I am different.
HeIp me be better.
PIease, Bob, Iet me go.
You know who Fahd Bahktiar is?
He's one of the worId's richest men.
He's peddllng nucIear information
to the MiddIe East.
I need a woman for this one.
It's the kind of job you were trained for.
I want you to do three things.
Number one: Impersonate his girIfriend
so you can get into his house.
Two: Take the disk that he's been sending
the data on, then destroy his computer.
And number three:
I want you to take him out.
If I do this job, if I bring this off...
...wllI you do what you can
to heIp me get out?
No.
Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen.
WouId you take these, John? Thanks.
Maggie! What a pIeasure!
How are you?
Does anybody ever get out?
Thank you, John. I'll do the rest.
Were you llke me once?
WouId they Iet you Ieave if you wanted to?
Happiness in llfe comes from braiding
together what one wouId llke to have...
...with what is inevitabIe.
Stop that shit!
Stop talking llke that and answer me!
I'm sorry.
I don't want to be rude to you. You were
the onIy one who was nice to me here.
PIease, couId you tell me?
CouId you just Ieave if you wanted to?
Just get on a pIane and disappear?
To tell the truth, dear...
...I don't know. It's a possibllity
that never entered my mind.
You won't tell Bob I came?
Thank you.
-You Iook tired.
-I am.
-Want a back rub?
-Yeah.
-With the hypnotic fantasy oll?
-Yeah.
All right.
On the bed.
I'll be right back.
Hello, Maggie.
These are copies of the photos
I gave you.
Amanda says that you...
...dropped them.
I don't think I can do it.
If you pull this job off for me...
...I'll see what I can do to heIp you.
See the upstairs corner?
That's his bedroom. Right here.
You arrive earIy. You do it here.
With the right wig, cIothes,
attitude, you can...
...Iook sufficientIy llke the girIfriend
to get in his house.
What happens to her? Does she die, too?
AbsoIuteIy not.
No unnecessary wetworks.
Good.
Look at those earrings.
Get the buck in the walk. It's that thing.
I have those gIasses.
-Yeah? Great.
-I'll get that brand of cigarettes.
-She's right-handed.
-Me, too.
Long cigarettes.
Is that moIe real?
Not on me, it won't be.
Here we go again.
''Happy birthday to you''
They don't go out!
It won't go out.
It's heavy.
It's heavy.
Get out of the way now.
Get out of the way now.
There he is.
Frank, for Christ's sake,
do us a favor and put the camera away.
All right.
Let's go over it again.
We've onIy done it 20 times.
Look, it's tomorrow night.
This is our Iast chance.
Okay. We meet at four o'cIock
to go to Angela's.
Let's make it a quarter to.
That'll give us more time.
Hey, honey!
UncIe Bob, is it really you?
How nice to see you.
No, it can't be UncIe Bob. It's got to be...
...Aunt Paullne or Cousin Molly...
...or something, right?
Wait a minute! I got it!
This must be Cindy D'Amato. Used to
work for Super Mac. Quit to get married.
Hi. How the hell are you?
What in heaven's name
have you got there?
You bought it for me, remember?
When I moved into the studio.
-Give me that nonsensical object. Give it--
-You keep away from me.
Don't you try to intimidate me.
You are not going to tell Carol.
Swear you won't!
I'll swear to nothing!
-Hi.
-Hi.
We're from Sherry's.
Where's Francine?
Francine's sick today, so Sherry sent us.
They said Francine was coming.
I guess they got it wrong
'cause Francine's sick. I don't know.
Sherry sent us
'cause Francine ate something bad.
She got sick.
I couId really care Iess
if I did another head of hair today.
So make up your mind.
All right. Come on.
Who are these peopIe? Where's Francine?
Francine's sick, so we're here.
Great. Some new fucking bIood.
Can you do me out here?
Sure. I can burn hair anywhere.
Is this outfit all right?
-Is the stain gone?
-Yes.
Fine. Put it in my room
with the red boots.
I want some fucking softness
around my face.
Last time Francine did me,
she sllcked all my hair back...
...and made me Iook llke
some kind of fucking dyke.
Did you guys meet my friends?
This is ''Stupid''
and the other one is ''Stupider.''
-WouId you llke some ginseng tea?
-No, I don't drink tea.
Francine says you Iove her ginseng tea.
It's great for the sex drive.
Well, I've got no troubIe
in that department.
It's really very good.
Enough with the fucking tea,
for Christ's sake.
Suit yourseIf.
-Do you have sllk, pIease, for my fingers?
-Sure.
Oh, God! I'm dead!
-Let me see.
-Damn it, I'm hit!
It's okay.
HoId stllI. Just push it hard.
I'm calling Kaufman.
-I'm calling Kaufman.
-I can finish it. I have to!
He said if anything goes wrong,
we're supposed to call him.
It's screwed up.
There are two down and I'm hit.
How?
Okay, okay. Yes, okay.
They're calling in a cIeaner.
Oh, Jesus!
We've heard reports of shots.
Did you hear anything?
I'm Victor. I'm the cIeaner.
The job's gone bad,
but I think I can finish it.
This part of the job's over.
I'm the cIeaner.
Where's the material?
Outside.
What's that for?
CIeaning up your shit.
Christ, what're you doing?
She's not dead.
Oh, God! Kaufman said no wetworks.
He said no wetworks. I'll call him now.
I never did mind about the llttIe things.
I'll go get ready for the next step.
-You Iook nice.
-Thank you.
All right, have a nice evening.
Hi, Angela.
-New driver?
-For Christ's sake, open the stupid gate!
It went off the tracks
and I called in a cIeaner.
What happened?
Two down. I was afraid we'd get splashed
with shit. I told him to get it cleaned up.
-How cIean?
-Down to the nap.
The cIeaner's going
with your girI to Bahktiar's.
After she finishes...
...he'll cIean her, too.
Of course, it was me.
I heard the bIoody thing.
He's upstairs. You're earIy.
-So sue me, stupid.
-Want a drink?
Salty Dog. Leave it down here.
I must piss.
Go to your computer,
bring up your nucIear program.
What are you going to accompllsh by this?
Do it!
Suck my dick.
Go to your computer.
ShouId the Arabs be the onIy peopIe
not to have this technoIogy?
Is that what you think?
Hurry up.
I cannot access the data.
Yeah, right.
The system is down.
Get around to the other side of the desk.
I can make you very rich,
beyond anything you can imagine.
And if I say I wllI, I wllI.
I'll do it, I promise.
What's the password?
What's the password?
Try to imagine what a bullet
in the stomach feeIs llke.
PeddIer.
You can't park there.
Move around the back with the other cars.
Are you deaf? Move the car!
On the ground.
Don't be a stupid bitch.
I'm offering you anything you want.
Get on your knees, forehead to the ground,
hands behind your back.
You think kllllng me wllI soIve anything?
You think you can keep 800 mllllon peopIe
in the 14th century forever?
That's it. I've had it.
Be sure it's hooked up to it.
Wait tllI he gets down here.
Is there a woman down there?
There couId be 20 women down there,
for all I know. The car's in a bad spot.
That's it.
You awake?
I know you are.
I can tell by the way you're breathing.
I'm so tired.
My God!
What happened to your face?
She's gone.
Where?
Where?
I don't know.
She took off empty-handed.
She didn't take any of her cIothes
or even her purse.
So whoever it is you are...
...just Ieave her alone. Let her go.
-I can't. She's got information.
-Here.
Why don't you get out?
She Ieft you a note.
Yeah?
I tore it up.
What did it say?
Can I take this?
Yeah, sure.
You llke Nina?
Yeah.
I Iove her.
We'll miss her.
We'll miss her.
We had a bad car wreck Iast night.
No, no...no.
We have all the information we need.
The cIeaner's dead...
...and the girI is...
...the girI is...
...the girI's dead, too.
Yeah.
