- Green light.
- Let's go.
How many times was John Wayne nominated
for an Academy Award?
Probably not enough.
Marcellino's still asleep.
- I'm gonna go relieve Ed.
- How the hell can one son of a bitch
sleep so much?
- Fear.
- As long as he wakes up to testify.
Oh, no.
We've been looking for you.
- So you want to be a witness?
- No, no, no, no!
Witness this.
His birthday
was in two weeks.
Harry, they wanna
take him out.
Harry?
Twenty-seven years of this shit,
and I never got a scratch. Jesus Christ.
I want a list of everybody
in Witness Protection...
who knew we
were holding Marcellino...
and anybody else
who could've known...
from the district attorney
to the commissioner.
They're dead, Mike.
Whoever set this up...
whatever it takes...
they're dead.
- Okay, Cullen. You're outta here.
-
-
-  Hey, you goddamn son of a...
- Whoa!
- Damn!
Aah!
Yes, sir. Heh! All right.
Have a good day then.
- You caught the bastard.
- In the act.
Bullshit. I was on my way
to a costume party.
He stopped somebody over at Route 74
for driving too fast.
- He was going to let them off for 50 bucks.
- They stopped me for directions.
Book him.
Impersonating an officer,
resisting arrest...
fraud, reckless driving
and lying to the sheriff.
- I'll be at home if you need me.
- Okay, Sheriff.
Come on, Deputy Dawg.
-
-
Amy?
Amy?
- Are we having a party?
- Of course...
and I'm glad you're home early
to join in the celebration.
Is it just gonna be us,
or are we gonna have company?
Be serious. Of course it's just us.
So, what are we celebrating?
Commemorating...
our fifth year.
Five years in exile.
Five years in a town without...
having found anybody who could talk
about anything except...
crops and the weather.
- It's not gonna be forever.
- The hell it's not.
Christ, Amy, this is old news.
Let it go.
- I did the best I could.
- The hell you did.
You could still be with the bureau.
You could've fought it.
We could still be living in New York.
You did not have to quit!
They gave me a chance to resign.
If it would've gone to trial...
I would've lost
and they would've kicked me out.
I wouldn't have even had
the chance to get this job!
What are we having
for dinner?
Just this.
This is gonna make us fat.
You think because we're in shape
we're not already fat?
Stuck.
Victims of circumstance.
And you know what a cow's
biggest contribution to this world is?
You should not drink
and bake.
Hello, Mark.
- Yeah?
- It's Shannon, Mark. Harry Shannon.
It's been a long time, Harry.
What's going on?
I want to talk to you, Mark.
I got trouble.
- Talk.
- No. Not on the telephone.
It's all I've got time for.
Things aren't so good,
huh, kid?
Seen better days.
If you wanna see 'em again,
meet me.
The bureau always arranges
such intriguing meeting places.
- This has nothing to do with the bureau.
-
Mr. Patrovita,
you deny any sources of illicit income...
any connection at all
with organized crime...
yet your reported income
for this past year was $73,000...
with which  somehow
managed to maintain...
a seven-bedroom mansion
here in Chicago...
four Cadillacs that we know of...
and a lifestyle that makes
Ted Turner look like a derelict.
Now, can you explain
how you manage this?
I think it'd be of particular interest
to those of us...
- on fixed incomes.
-
- I know, I know.
- What the hell has he got to do with it?
- He's special federal prosecutor.
- That son of a bitch cost me a career.
You brought in a suspect with
half the bones in his body broken.
- Any prosecutor would've gone after you.
- Oh, you remember the case.
The guy kidnapped
an 11 -year-old girl.
He molested, murdered
and mutilated her.
Well, the public wasrt too keen
on heavy-handed cops at that time.
Baxter was out
to nail me to the wall.
- I went to see him,
tried to tell him what happened...
- What did he say?
Resign or be prosecuted.
Any way you want it.
Yeah, well,
the good news is that...
he's giving Patrovita a lot more shit
than he ever gave you.
-
- I got a lotta debts.
-
-  Uh-huh. To whom?
- Friends.
- Like Paulo Rocca and Bill Rusman?
I plead the Fifth Amendment.
-
- That's Lu Patrovita.
He runs the strongest
of the Chicago families.
-
-  Mr. Rocca,
your stated source of income...
is a travel agency, yet you,
like Mr. Patrovita...
seem to, uh, have a lifestyle
that far exceeds your income.
Would you mind shedding some light
for us on what seems to be...
some extraordinary
money management here?
I'll take the Fifth on this,
on whatever you're gonna ask me next...
Honest men don't have to tolerate
this kind of harassment in this country.
Thank you, Mr. Rocca,
for reminding us of our inalienable rights.
So we did  You're the one
in the bureau. What do you want from me?
Do, uh...
Do you remember my son?
Blair. Yeah. We went to
some ball games with him.
- Yeah, that's right.
- He joined the bureau, didn't he?
Yep.
Dead.
I want Patrovita.
- He killed Blair?
- Blair was covering a government aide...
a witness who could've
put the bastard away forever.
No.
No, he had
somebody do it.
There's nothing that a small-town sheriff
can do that you can't.
Oh, no, no. The bureau
has nothing to do with this.
No, I'm financing
this myself.
I have $45,000
in savings.
I want you to get inside the Patrovita
organization and tear it up.
Who do you think I look like?
Dirty Harry?
- I think you look like an unappy man.
- You have a cure?
Possible reinstatement.
Get back into the bureau.
-
- How?
The bureau's been trying to get somebody
inside of Patrovita's family for over a year...
but there's
a big leak somewhere.
All our guys
keep getting nailed.
That's why no one but me
will know about you. Nobody.
Now, you do a good job, you pull this off,
and you've got a great shot.
Do you think I'd
still pass the physical?
This is Kaminski, investigating a break-in
at the Petrolcam storage yard.
Roger, Sheriff. We copy.
I'm sorry you had to kill yourself off, kid...
but it's safer
for everybody that way.
The false I.D. Corresponds
to a guy...
in the N.C.I. Computer
with a bad rap sheet.
The phone number
is a safe house...
where an answering machine
is set up to catch your bulletins.
There's $25,000 for initial expenses;
more if you need it.
The squat-face guy is a new kid on the block.
His name is "Hammer" Lamanski.
He's been biting off
little pieces of Patrovita's pie.
Big player, number eight!
Place your bets.
Place your bets.
All bets down.
All bets down.
Throw the dice!
Seven! You lose.
Come and get another number.
Come and get
another number.
I don't think the table is straight.
I want to see Mr. Lamanski.
He's not around, pal. And all losers
don't think a table is straight.
I'm still right.
- Magic or magnet?
- Rudy! Rudy!
Hey, you! Get outta here!
Scram!
Who the fuck are you?
Hey! Wait up!
Guys, make sure to clean up the mess
before you knock off, okay?
I'm gonna kill
that bastard.
Excuse me. Could you move
to the side a little bit?
- Your lights.
- Thank you.
Oh, shit!
It's costing us a lot of money
to get together like this...
because now my time
is won'th as much as yours.
- Worth more.
- Hmm?
- You got less of it.
- I gave you the courtesy of this talk...
because you worked
for me a long time.
Like I said,
close down everything and get out...
or one morning you
are gonna wake up dead.
Luigi, I got employees, obligations...
There's plenty for both of us.
There's no "both of us."
There's just me.
- You got two days.
- And then what? Back to work for you?
You don't work around here
anymore for me...
or anybody.
-
-  You got it.
Get down! Move it!
Fucking Lamanski! Who the hell
does that son of a bitch think he is?
-
-
That bastard's crazy!
He's a fucking amateur!
He learned nothing from me!
- I'm still okay, right?
- Yeah.
Tony was a good kid.
Make sure you get
a good replacement for him.
You son of a bitch!
- Hey, you got the wrong car, pal.
- Shut up.
Hey, you know
who it belongs to?
Yeah, a guy who is probably gonna be dead
before it's out of warranty.
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you. Drive.
-
- Take off all your jewelry.
- Do you know who bought all this stuff?
- Martin Lamanski.
He has good taste in jewelry,
but you've a rotten taste in men.
Come on.
Gonna mess up your hair.
Attagirl. Keep going.
Fuckir shit!
You took my lunch, you son of a bitch!
Good evening, sir.
-
- Down.
- There is no down.
- Hey, I'm not a cop.
I'm a player.
- A martini on me.
- Get you a drink?
- Oh, bartender.
- Yes, sir, a Manattan.
Yeah, another one.
What do you need?
Couple of minutes
with Mr. Rocca.
- Not possible.
- Tell him I'm the pain in Lamanski's ass.
Wait here.
- You're working for Morgan and Company, right?
- Richard's supposed to meet us.
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.
Cards?
- Losing improves your character.
- Winning improves your wardrobe.
-
-
- Go on in.
-
What's your name?
Joseph P. Brenner...
Joey.
And you're the pain
in Lamanski's ass, huh?
Wasted one of his joints
and took down a couple of his bag men.
And this stuff
comes from his girlfriend.
What'd you bother
with that for?
Intimidation.
Let him know that nothing is safe.
What are you
trying to prove?
Joey, this is Max Keller.
Max takes care of things...
all kinds of things.
- Trying to prove that maybe you can use me.
- For what?
To take care of things...
all kinds of things.
That job's filled.
I'm sure a smart man like Mr. Rocca
is always looking to upgrade.
- I'm the best there is.
-
if you're the best there is,
the wheel would've never been invented.
- How'd you know I was looking for somebody?
- I didn't.
I thought
I might get lucky.
Where're you from?
The last few years?
Miami.
- Your references?
- I'm in the computer.
I'm sure you can find a couple of cops
that can punch it up for you.
What makes you think I'd be happy
to see Lamanski's ass kicked?
You see, in Miami, we can tell everything
by the flow of the blow.
This Lamanski has been making
bigger buys every week.
Now, I know he has been
biting into someone's action.
Go see the cashier.
She'll give you a thousand dollars
in chips. Enjoy yourself.
In case you forget,
I'll be checking back with you.
I don't believe
a fucking word he said.
Girl Scouts build character...
and it's a lot cheaper.
You pester me,
I'll have you tossed out.
You have that kind
of clout around here?
- They know me.
- I envy them.
-
- I'm sure nobody will mind
if you go home before you're broke.
Don't trouble yourself over my money.
I always get more.
Getting it somewhere else
might change your luck.
Where the hell
do you think he's goir?
He's in here? Perfect!
If any more guys duck down that alley,
we're gonna start sellir tickets.
- Where'd he go?
- This way.
Come on, come on!
Come on!
Forget it!
- Hurry up!
- Wait up!
- Any trouble?
- Oh, nothing special.
- All these alleys probably have rats.
- You got some I.D.?
Sure.
Saw those three guys
leave the hotel after ya.
Anything particular
or, uh, just a mugging?
They had trouble telling me
what they wanted.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Joseph P. Brenner.
What's the "P" stand for?
Pussy.
See ya around.
The apartment is okay.
I'm renting a car tomorrow.
Something happened last night
that got me thinking.
I might get into a spot
where a cop is shooting at me.
Any idea how
I ought to handle it?
Three back-busters jumped me.
I have a feeling that Max Keller
had something to do with it.
Rocca is probably checking on me
as I talk. I'll stay in touch.
Hi.
When was the last time
you had a good piss?
Hey, let me in. I gotta take a leak.
-
- Don't move!
- Hold it right there!
- In the back room! Cover me!
- We got 'em now!
- Let's get out of here!
- Freeze!
-
- Hey, what the...
- Hold it!
-
-
- You got a paper?
- I got a warrant. You got your rights.
Patrovita's got
a big fuckir headache.
Call the president.
I think we just fixed the deficit.
That's $100 million
on the street.
We can make it up
in a couple of weeks.
Just what
Lamanski needed.
If he's got a lot of shit on hand,
he's gonna step in at bargain prices...
and grab a great big chunk
of the business!
Well, why don't we
just take him out?
Because he's
looking for it!
You won't get near him now,
unless you want to start a war.
Nobody needs that.
Later.
- How many got busted?
-
Nobody pulled a trigger.
They'll all make bail.
Have you found
a replacement for Tony?
I'm looking somebody over.
- I want it back.
- What?
The money. The smack.
It's mine. I want it back.
Oh, come on! What are we gonna do,
knock over city hall?
We don't even know
where they got it stashed.
But we know somebody
who can tell us.
That shit is mine.
I paid for it, and I want it back.
And I'm gonna get it back.
How the hell is it
you never did any time?
I'm smart,
unlike someone we know.
Max thinks you stink
from trouble.
-
- I'm sure he makes a lot of mistakes.
Never the same one twice.
You're on.
But consider yourself temporary.
We start tomorrow.
It's nice to be
one of the family.
- Get my car, please.
- Yes, sir.
Sam, could you
get me a cab, please?
How'd you do
the other night?
- Your money didn't change a thing.
- And tonight?
I got out with cab fare.
Maybe you should try
a different kind of recreation.
Losing at tennis
wouldn't make me feel any better.
The exercise might.
- We don't need you.
- Thanks, pal.
Okay. Thank you.
You're a real
take-charge guy.
Hold your glass very still.
Oh!
Huh!
Oh. I don't know why they advertise
all those sleeping pills on television.
I mean, chemicals are
no good for you.
A couple of bottles of champagne
wipes you right out.
Exactly.
What are you sayir?
Are you sayir you're ready for bed?
- I think so.
- That sounds like a hell of an idea to me.
Gonna help you get up.
Ooh!
Uuh! God!
- Here.
- There you go.
There you go.
Come on. Hurry.
Oh, God!
- You know what I like about bedrooms?
- No. What?
You almost always
find a bed in there.
You know what?
I've noticed
the same thing.
Oh, my God.
Great.
Uuh!
-
-
...
Dade County licence number...
Passport number...
H-1032642.
Okay? He's asleep.
If there's something to say,
I'll call.
but the, uh, keys werert where they were
supposed to be, so we couldn't do anything.
If you tell us where the keys have been moved,
we'll come back and take care of it.
Look, come back to me
as quick as you can.
Yeah, you don't want
to freeze to death in that water.
- Fucking little worm.
- What's his problem?
We give him a million dollars
to tell us where to hit Marcellino.
Now the son of a bitch
is pulling back.
Well, maybe he doesn't know
where the shit is stored.
How many places do you think the cops
can store that much cash and smack, huh?
Or maybe he just doesn't like
what you're planning.
I'm supposed to give a shit
what he thinks?
No, he'll come across.
What the hell's his choice?
-
- There's no way I can talk you out of this?
If you could, I shouldn't be where I am.
When we start thinking
there's something we can't do...
something that's too big or too messy,
then we oughta get out.
This is like wrestling.
It's fixed.
And the cops are always gonna lose,
and they know it.
-
-
-
- Over here, honey.
- Jeanine! Over here!
-
- Where's Metzger?
- I haven't seen him.
- How's business?
- We're dying.
That's him!
-
-
- Hey! Watch it!
-
- Stop it!
- Asshole!
-
-
-
-
-
- Hey, you cretin!
-
- Oh, God!
-
Uh! No, no! No, please!
-
-
- Help me!
- Come here!
I hear you're paying off everybody
but the fucking government.
- Lamanski says pay him.
He'll come back with a torch.
- So you decided to pay us both.
- Is that it?
I didn't know you had so much loose cash.
- Just stay out of it.
- No. I'm gonna close down.
- Oh, yeah? You try it, all right?
-
- You piece of shit!
- Uh!
- Ah! Do something, huh?
-
- This is what you're gonna look like dead.
- Don't pay Lamanski anymore.
-
If I torch this shit-house,
you'll be inside it.
Get in my way again,
and I'll kill ya.
I hope you're not
your mother's only child.
Ohh! Oh, Mr. Metzger,
are you all right?
- I didn't think you were this twisted.
- Twisted? This is kid stuff.
We got a call. Somebody thought
there was some trouble here.
Oh, the boys were having
some trouble with their makeup.
Joey P. Brenner. You turn up
in the most damnedest places.
Trying to learn
my way around.
Well, you got a good guide if you wanna
know your way around a sewer.
- Where do you know that cop from?
- Oh, he broke up a fight I had in an alley...
the night you sent your three assholes
to take me apart.
- I don't want his name. I want his ass.
- I'll see to it he disappears.
First you bust him up real good,
public and messy.
Everybody should know what you get
when you kick in my door.
Shit, I hate this game.
This looks like
it's going to be fun.
- That'd be different.
- Why? He's not a good host?
Some of his friends
can be a pain in the neck.
Hey, you're with
the main man.
- If you have any trouble, you let me know.
-
- Wear that one.
- Beautiful, beautiful. Give it some sparkle.
- Such a pretty dress.
- Oh, like this?
Joey.
I was hoping
you could make it.
Monique.
- Quite a party.
- Party?
This is just a simple gathering
of the immediate family.
Luigi's parties
have to be held outdoors.
He wants to meet you.
Be right back.
- Hey, you guys having fun? I'm having a lot of fun.
-
Let's capture the moment here,
huh? Come on.
Max, maybe you're
having too much fun.
Eat something.
- I'll get you a nice eight by ten.
- Keep it. I'm not sentimental.
I didn't think so.
Come in.
- Joey Brenner, Luigi Patrovita.
- My pleasure.
You like getting close
to our friend?
You want the job
done right, don't you?
- What have you found out?
- Nothing.
I want you.
We tried that,
remember?
You come home with me,
and you owe nobody nothing.
I'll owe you,
won't I?
Mr. Rocca thinks you would make
a won'thwhile addition...
- to our various endeavors.
- I like to think so.
- Oh, you're a thinker.
-
Not enough to get me
into any trouble.
From what we know,
you don't stay anyplace too long.
If you're not part of an organization
that can protect you...
- moving around is the next best thing.
- He's looking for a home.
You kill anybody, Joey?
Yeah.
More than one?
Three. You want names
and addresses?
-
- Smart, I like.
Smart-ass, I don't.
All right. Forget it. Go back to the party.
I want to talk to Mr. Rocca.
Nice meeting you.
I don't know.
You don't let him in
too far too fast.
Give him a little time
to impress us.
If he doesn't, we'll use him for
something dirty and dump him in the pit.
Cute, huh?
What a doll.
Yes, I think it would accessorize
the outfit beautifully.
What do you think?
Does it make you drool?
I would have picked exactly
the same one. That is my taste.
Yeah? Do you like
this one better?
- What do you think?
Which one do you like better?
- Try it on.
- You don't mind sitting here?
- No. I like it.
- Okay. All right. I'll see you later.
- Bye.
All right.
- Well, this goes with the color. It's beautiful.
- Something in red?
...
Why don't you just pick one?
I'll never make up my mind.
- Why don't you take them both?
- I can't afford them both.
I can.
Oh. You do that
too easy.
You always buying things
for the ladies?
- No. Not in a long time.
- Kiss her good-bye, shithead.
It's a stickup.
- Call security.
- Oh, really?
Just dial, dipshit!
