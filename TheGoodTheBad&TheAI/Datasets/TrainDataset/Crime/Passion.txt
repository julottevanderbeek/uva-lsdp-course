I took sleeping pills.
I can not sleep.
Do you know that Christine Stanford
throat was slit on Saturday?
Do you recognize this?
Do you recognize this?
It has been sent from your computer.
Is not the victim of some
humility now on you at work?
Miss James?
We found ... Miss James!
I am here.
We found the victim's hand, fibers,
derived from scarf.
Such,
that you have in this picture.
Can you explain it? Where were you
Saturday night at 23.30 - 01.00?
I was at the ballet.
- Where?
Ballet.
Were you alone?
- I was.
To identify any of you?
- Why would it have been?
Sometimes you can meet people,
who may remember.
Remember what?
- You to attend.
You would have an alibi, and you should
could not kill Christine Stanford.
I could not ...
I will never ...
If you have a lawyer,
you should call him.
Open your mouth.
Laboratory confirmed,
the fibers are scarf.
You will be charged with murder.
Isabelle, are you okay?
Can we get him in the water?
- Miss James.
Is a break?
Do you need a doctor?
I do not.
- Let's get this soon.
Lavastitte burglary,
aggravating the offense.
It is, therefore, of a deliberate murder.
Why do not you just recognize?
It would save everyone time and money.
You have a few fiber, which is suitable for
my client scarf image.
How many other scarf they fit?
Did you find the sacrifice of my client's DNA?
Surmasitteko Christine Stanford?
- Do not answer.
Yes, yes, I suppose so.
- Think about what you say, Isabelle.
What do you mean "probably"?
Surmasitteko?
Did you kill her?
- Do not answer.
Acknowledge that the murder?
- He did not do it.
I confess.
Hell!
- Forward.
Login now!
Away from the door!
- Do not respond to .
-  He did not do it.
-  My client's mental state ...
-  I confess.
What?
- I want to see my lawyer.
I did not kill Christine.
- You want a confession back?
I'm innocent.
- Then why are you confessed?
I do not know. I was so tired.
I was a pill drunk.
I would have recognized anything.
I need to talk
with the prosecutor immediately.
This looks the same material,
but my scarf is not broken.
Where is it?
- Somewhere in my apartment.
We studied the apartment thoroughly
and did not find anything.
Seek out yet. The scarf is there.
- He has no reason to lie.
You've wasted enough of my time.
- Why would I be murdered Christine?
You had a strong motive. Revenge.
- I have not written that.
And if I were, then it would have been
foolish to kill him.
Christine probably sent it to the
my computer.
Creator. Look at the date.
This is referred to
days before the lumps.
Do you see? The day before
he humbled me.
This does not make sense.
I did not write this.
I was about to get a promotion,
Christine and bear it.
He tried to suppress Isabelle.
Many department confirms -
that my client became depressed
Christine's bullying of.
Are you crazy?
That's defenses?
Spare
mitigating circumstances for the judge!
I'm only interested in evidence.
- It is what we are trying to give.
I was not Christine's house.
I was at the ballet.
You claim it.
I talked to
Ballet with an usher.
He had a gray, curly hair,
and he spoke bad English.
He remembers me.
Have you seen this woman?
- I do not.
Do not you surely?
- I do not.
Days. Katsoisitteko this?
Have you seen this woman?
I am.
- Do you?
He sat there. He wanted to
may sit in the middle of the line.
I had to guide him in there.
Whether or not this will certainly
this woman? - There was.
I booked a ticket
Saturday night's myöhäisnäytökseen.
He could not be
Christine's home.
Maybe he left the States. Christine
the house was ten minutes away.
Why do not you ask Dirk harrimanella?
He was reportedly there.
He was furious,
Christine rejected because of him.
And he was drunk.
He knew everything from ballet.
- It is a well-known classic.
Usher guarantee him an alibi.
What else do we have?
His DNA was not
the murder weapon and the crime scene.
No DNA but e-mail,
which is the only who could not write.
As if we were forced
labile to recognize the woman.
Just check
Christine male friend.
Witnesses saw them
fighting over the crime scene outside.
Or even miesystäväkin.
Either the house is checking out?
Together, this evidence
nolaan myself in court.
My client was accused of
wrong reasons. He has an alibi.
Against him is not
no evidence. No DNA.
What about the scarf fibers?
- They are not my huivistani.
You say, then, that you have for one.
- It must be found. It is not broken.
May I make a suggestion?
- Of course.
Do you offer to help my client
scarf for search?
What's this?
Christine found out that Dirk
tried to cheat a large sum of money.
How much?
- I do not know the exact figure.
More than five million.
The sum of one million of Class,
and Christine was going to expose him?
Why piilottelitte proof?
We are friends. Dirk needed
just the time to restore the money.
So hid the information. Do not you
understand that it is a motive for murder?
No! Dirk could never do that.
We have to leave.
- Wait a minute. Can I look for?
My scarf is in that box.
Sometimes they slip out of the back of the box.
Alright. Let her look.
- Thank you.
It's got to be here.
- That's enough, Isabelle.
It's got to be here! No!
Even a minute!
Just one minute! Do not be!
I did not do it.
Of course not.
I know that.
Headscarf is
in one of the apartment.
You have to look for it.
What a mess.
Should I clean up?
Where did you get this?
- It was dirty, the back of the box.
I took it to the cleaners.
Ms. Wirth, this is outrageous.
You will get another cleaner.
Detective Chief Inspector Bach.
Mr. Harriman.
- What do you want?
I am a detective sergeant Bach.
You are accused of embezzlement.
We studied the place.
First the car, then your apartment.
You have to get the wire.
- The prosecutor will explain to you everything.
Christine broke into Stanford
apartment night of the murder?
I will not.
- Do you deny olleenne there?
I do not.
Were you his guest?
- I was. I arrived late.
When?
- I do not remember.
You do not remember?
- I do not remember.
Is this you?
It was scarf.
Was that?
- Yes.
If that's Christine Stanford
blood ... Put the recovery.
This is ridiculous.
- Kavalsitte company money.
Christine was going to report you.
You're a villain but also a murderer.
I do not speak any
without a lawyer present.
Is not it incredible?
He bought me a bouquet of roses.
Then he showed up at my door
apologize.
He was quite red
naamaltaan and bathed in sweat.
He was so sorry,
I was arrested a while.
The time sweet.
Did you invite him in?
No, you crazy?
I smiled sweetly, -
I took the cheap roses fool
with explanatory notes and threw them in the garbage.
Bach poor. What a cliché.
The hard-boiled cop
fall in love with the beautiful killer.
I'm not a murderer.
Oh, yeah.
Dani ...
I know what you did for me.
You would have done the same for me.
- Of course.
Shall again
number 26? - Okay.
They are okay, but do not
good enough. What do you think?
Dani!
That kiss did not happen.
I love you.
I want you, Isabelle.
That's the problem.
Why?
- Jesus Christ! Are you kidding me?
After all, you love me.
- I do not. What's wrong with you?
I do not love you.
- You love.
You may not want to admit it,
but you love me.
We have drunk too much.
I make espressos, and I'll call a taxi.
Go home and sleep.
Talk to you tomorrow.
No, not tomorrow.
It's not true, Isabelle?
You love me.
- Stop it. You are pathetic.
Am I pathetic?
All my support after that?
I am grateful. Thank you.
- That you gave already.
This is the espresso. Sit down
and then find out. I'll call you a cab.

And I downloaded this folder.
