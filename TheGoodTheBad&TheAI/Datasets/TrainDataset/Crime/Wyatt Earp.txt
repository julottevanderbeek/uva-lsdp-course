They just moved out of the O.K. Corral
down by Fly's.
Looks like Ike and Billy Clanton...
the McLaurys, Billy Claiborne.
Maybe more.
Let's go.
Morgan, take care of Mama for me.
Keep your little brother out of trouble.
Warren, I won't be seeing you for a while.
Where you headed, Wyatt?
Nowheres.
- I thought you went to Logan.
- I changed my mind.
Where you going, son?
To town. I'm going to enlist, Pa.
I want to fight the Rebs
with James and Virg.
- I'm ready.
- Are you?
You think your ma's ready?
I don't think she is.
Why'd you wait till I left
to take off, Wyatt...
if you think it's the right thing?
Virgil and James should be
coming on home any day soon now.
Until they do, you know your job.
What was that? I didn't hear you.
Eighty acres of corn.
You take on a job, you finish it.
Any man who can't be depended on steady
isn't worth the trouble of having around.
What makes you think
they're coming home soon, Pa?
This war can't last forever.
Besides, it's what I want to happen.
You know I got to whup you a bit.
Come on, Johnny Reb.
Virgil?
Look who got long and tall.
We didn't know you was coming.
Why didn't you send word?
We didn't know ourselves,
so then we thought we'd just come on.
Is James coming, too?
James is right here with me, Wyatt.
Don't shoot me now, you hear?
James.
- James, welcome home.
- Give us a hand here.
Thank you, Lord.
Your mother thinks
there's something wrong with me.
She says there's something in my blood
that won't allow me to stay put.
She may be right.
If she's lucky,
I haven't passed it on to you.
We'll see.
But for this family,
the time has come to move on again.
To the west of here
is a vast expanse of untamed territory...
full of wild Indians and countless dangers.
But beyond that wilderness
lies a land with great promise...
where civilization has flourished
for hundreds of years.
We'll go to California
and see what we can make of that place.
But why, Pa?
There are opportunities for lawyers...
and rich land available
for people who know how to work.
In California, Wyatt will study the law
and perhaps come to work with me.
Maybe Morgan and Warren
will join our firm.
I've already told Pa that I'm not going.
I wanna see what's available to me here.
- I don't want to go, either.
- Martha's in love with Jimmy Jorgenson.
Good for you, Martha. He's a standup boy.
His family knows what it means
to put down roots.
Martha, if you don't want to go,
that's your decision.
James has said he will join us,
which suits me fine.
The closer you keep your family,
the better.
They're the only ones you can rely on.
Remember this, all of you.
Nothing counts so much as blood.
The rest are just strangers.
Nicholas, I think
you've already told them that.
A hundred times.
- You can't hear it enough.
- I heard it a thousand times.
I heard you, Pa. Blood counts the most.
I just want you to get these things
and get back.
Don't talk to anyone
you don't have business with.
- Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.
- That doesn't comfort me, Tom Chapman.
Both of you use your heads.
- Don't linger.
- Don't worry, Ma. We won't shame you.
Giddap.
See you later. Nice pitchfork.
- I like this town, Wyatt.
- Why don't you give up?
Excuse me.
I am not going in there.
Take a look, though.
Come on! Go ahead!
Stand back!
I'll settle this right now!
How you doing, Wyatt?
I'm okay, Pa.
You know, this land is full of people
doing wicked things to each other.
I ain't afraid. I like it out here.
I like how nothing much has been touched.
I got to tell you something, Wyatt.
I told your brothers
when they went off to fight...
and I suppose the time's come for you.
You know I'm a man
that believes in the law.
After your family, it's about the only thing
you got to believe in.
But there are plenty of men
who don't care about the law.
Men who'll take part in all kinds of
viciousness and don't care who gets hurt.
In fact, the more they get hurt, the better.
When you find yourself in a fight
with such viciousness...
hit first if you can.
And when you do hit, hit to kill.
You'll know. Don't worry.
You'll know when it comes to that.
The Earps always know.
Damn it, Wyatt, move this wagon!
They're catching up!
- This is all we got, Dutch!
- Whip those nags!
Giddap! Come on!
Hold on, Dutch!
- They're on us!
- Shoot the horse.
- What?
- Shoot the lead horse!
You can hit a horse, can't you?
Come on, boys.
That horse never done nothing to me.
You should be riding shotgun.
I've seen you shoot.
'Course, I can't handle a team like you.
Hell, we made it. That's the thing.
You ever shoot a man, Dutch?
Sure. I shot a few.
How do you think I got this job?
How about yourself?
No.
Hope I never do, either.
Good luck.
If it ain't the sore-ass boys
back for another Fourth of July.
Hey, Red!
I hope you brought sugar in this load.
I ain't had no real sugar for a month.
What's happening in this hellhole, Red?
You got any new ladies
up to my standards?
I believe that there is a new one
just right for you, Dutch.
She can stay awake two minutes at a time
and she favors them teeny little wangers.
Look who's talking.
Prize fight Sunday morning, Wyatt.
You gonna referee?
I don't know. Last time,
some of the boys didn't like the decision.
Sore losers. Hell with them. See you later.
Fight!
Get him, Shanssey!
Keep your guard up, Shanssey.
That's it. Take him down!
Keep your hands off!
One. Two.
- Get up!
- Three.
- You're hurt, Mr. Shanssey.
- No, I'm just getting started.
- It's not worth it.
- Let me fight him.
- Are you sure?
- Aye.
Fight.
Enough.
It's over!
God bless you, boy.
Kid.
You don't know a boxing ring
from a mule's asshole...
and you twice cost me money.
Sorry you didn't like the decision.
Stay out. It's not your fight.
Come on, Wyatt.
- This is the damnedest game I ever saw.
- You can't get a spot now anyway.
So why don't you just come on up with me
for a while?
I don't know if that would be
the right thing to do, Sally.
See, I promised my heart to another.
- Which girl? I'll fight her for you.
- It's no one here.
She's back in Lamar, Missouri,
where my grandparents live.
Missouri? Wyatt, she ain't gonna
help you tonight.
I saw her three times back in '63.
The third time she smiled at me just right.
I guarantee you
she don't know what I know.
I'll bet you're right about that,
unless things have changed in Lamar.
Your boy Dutch is drunk and he's telling
everybody how you're gonna take Ed Ross.
Damn!
Who's Ed Ross?
He's the guy who decked you
at the fight this morning.
I'd get a hold of Dutch before he starts
some real trouble for you, all right?
- Thanks, Red.
- Sure.
I know Ed Ross. He's bad business.
I'd better find Dutch.
- Gentlemen, that's it for me.
- You don't have to leave yet.
- You done?
- All yours.
How do you play this game, fellas?
Simple, friend. Bet on the number
you think is the winner.
If you're betting for it to lose,
tap her with a penny on top.
All bets on the spread. Comes the turn.
The loser: Jack.
The winner is ace.
- I had a feeling this was a game for me.
- You're a winner, sir.
Can we have a better time than this
upstairs?
At least upstairs
I'd be making some money.
Wyatt Earp!
That's my name.
That don't mean shit to me
or anybody else in this world.
And it never will after this night.
- Ed, this boy isn't worth your trouble.
- Shut up, Sally.
Earp, I hear you was looking for me
to make a fight.
- So I thought I'd be easy to find.
- You heard wrong, mister.
Only thing that's happened between us
is I got popped good.
- I don't want to make a fight.
- Stop talking.
Okay.
This man wanted to shoot me down...
over nothing!
He lost.
I'm taking his gun.
Boom.
- Yes?
- Hello, Mrs. Sutherland.
I don't expect you'll remember me...
I know perfectly well who you are,
young man.
Your grandmother told me
you were coming back to Lamar.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm reading the law with Judge Earp.
Are those flowers for me?
- Lf you'd like them, then, yes, they are.
- No, thanks.
Let me see if Urilla is around.
She might take them.
Hello, Wyatt.
Hello, Urilla.
I brought you these.
Thank you.
I was glad to hear
you were coming back to town.
- You were?
- Yes, I was.
What's wrong?
What is it, Wyatt?
I wasn't prepared
for how beautiful you are.
Did you learn to talk that way out west?
So you've come to Lamar
to study with your grandfather?
Yes.
And to marry you.
- Do you think it's as simple as that?
- No.
I know it will take a great effort
to win you.
I know many men have tried.
They failed because
you were meant for me.
But I'll succeed. I'll begin today.
Is that your hat?
When do you expect
to begin your practice, Wyatt?
It may be a while yet, sir.
The judge says he's never seen anybody
make slower progress.
That's 'cause the law is so damn boring.
Erwin, not everyone has the aptitude
to be a blacksmith.
I don't know.
I think I could teach Wyatt here
a thing or two...
- if he was willing to work at it.
- I appreciate that, but I've found a job.
I thought I should make a living
while I continue my studies.
What is it, Wyatt? What's the job?
With the city police.
I'm to be a constable.
I figure a man who's about to
propose marriage better have a livelihood.
When do you expect
this proposal to happen...
so we can all join in the crying?
Daddy, Wyatt's proposed to me every day
since he's been back in town.
...be faithful to him
as long as you both shall live?
I do.
May we have the ring, please?
Place the ring
on the ring finger of her left hand...
and repeat after me:
- Urilla.
- "Urilla."
With this ring, I thee wed.
"With this ring, I thee wed."
By the virtue of the authority vested in me
as a judge of the State of Missouri Court...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Urilla, if it doesn't work out,
you know where to find me.
Wyatt, you give it your best shot.
You can do it.
Make us proud, Wyatt.
You've never seen such open space, Urilla.
You can ride all day toward
some mountain and never even get close.
There's practically nobody there.
The few people that are...
they just make up
whatever kind of life they want.
What if you don't ever go back?
That's all right. I seen it.
I don't want to be the reason
that you're not happy.
I could be happy anywhere with you.
I don't care what job I have or where I live.
What I care about is being with you.
I thought this was only supposed
to happen in the morning.
Please, Wyatt, let's not talk about it!
Can't you let me be?
You can't go in.
- I want to see my girl.
- Esther, I can't allow it.
Has something gone wrong
with the pregnancy?
This has nothing to do with that.
It's typhoid.
I'm going to have to quarantine the house.
I can't let you go in, Esther.
It wouldn't be fair to the town.
...our blessed Savior, who is himself
the resurrection and the life...
has assured us that this body,
which we now commit to the ground...
dust to dust and ashes to ashes,
shall be raised in a perfect form...
and united to the spirit
which has gone to God.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ...
and the love of God,
and the communion of the Holy Ghost...
What's the matter with you?
What the hell? Come on. Back off.
This ain't no hotel, you stinking bum.
I can't tell you from the horse crap.
Keep walking.
Pardon me, sir.
I wonder if you could spare a fella
the price of a meal.
You're drunk.
- No, sir, not at present.
- You reek of it and worse.
I'm not in the business of helping drunks.
You're correct, mister.
I have done my share of drinking lately,
and I intend to correct my behavior.
It would be a good start
if you could lend me the price of a meal.
There's no excuse for drunkenness.
Or for the self-pity
which so often occasions it.
Yes, sir.
If you really want a meal,
come with me, and I'll arrange it.
But I won't give you money.
Thank you, sir. I accept.
I don't know if they'll serve you here.
Maybe they'll give you a meal in the back.
Wait!
You don't know what you're talking about!
- You want a snort?
- No.
- Bob?
- Coming.
- Here. You can have the hat, too!
- Son of a bitch!
That's a little better.
Leastwise, I can take you in my bed
without you fouling it.
- I'm sure you have your standards.
- Don't think I don't.
- Pretty new at this, ain't you?
- What?
Making a wreck of yourself.
Won't last much longer.
Gonna reform, are you, ace?
Reckon I'll get myself shot dead
pretty soon.
Let's find out what's left of you.
All right.
Pa?
Horse thief.
- How did you find...
- Shut up! Do you want to die?
That's what they do to horse thieves.
They hang them.
I don't care...
Do you think you're the first man
to lose someone?
That's what life is all about: Loss.
But we don't use it as an excuse
to destroy ourselves.
We go on. All of us.
Even you, Wyatt.
You're getting out of here.
I gave them $500 bail.
And I told them
I'd defend you at your trial.
There's not gonna be any trial.
Because if they try you, they'll hang you.
And if they catch you, they'll hang you.
So you get on that horse, Wyatt,
and you ride.
You keep riding
till you get out of Arkansas.
And you don't come back here, ever.
Ed.
This could be the one.
I got it.
- How about some hot coffee?
- We serve warm whiskey, not hot coffee.
Why don't you find me some coffee?
- Coffee she is.
- Excuse me, mister.
We saw you come in with your wagon,
but we didn't see any skinners with you.
That's 'cause there wasn't any.
- Quit?
- Dead.
That's as good as quit in my book.
My brother and me
are looking for work as skinners.
Bartender!
My luck finally turned
with those big stinking bastards.
Whiskey all around!
- No, thanks.
- Wait a second, mister.
Link Borland's buying, so drink up.
Thanks, but I got some coffee coming.
I don't do well on whiskey.
If you'd pay for my coffee,
I'd be much obliged.
Drink!
I've been in a real bad mood
for a couple of years...
so why don't you leave me alone?
Drop your gun belt and go away.
- Got any experience?
- A little.
It ain't too hard
shooting a bunch of dumb animals.
Skinning's the ugly part.
Our mother didn't raise no shirkers.
- $25 apiece.
- Mister, that's a deal.
My name is Ed Masterson.
- This is my brother...
- Bat.
- What?
- Bat Masterson.
Bat?
Okay, Bat. Wyatt Earp.
- We got a brother named Jim, too.
- One brother?
That's all you boys got?
One measly brother?
Better than nothing, I guess.
There's nothing counts so much as blood.
Everybody else is just strangers.
I guess we know where we stand
with Wyatt, don't we, Ed?
You boys keep up that good skinning,
you just might get to be family yet.
Of course, before you can be family...
I'd have to know
where you got that name, Bat.
It's just my name.
I already told you 10 times, Wyatt.
They always called me that.
Shut up, Ed.
I tell you what, Ed.
You tell me his real name...
I'll let you do some shooting tomorrow.
- Bartholomew Masterson.
- Bartholomew?
Why, Bat, that's a beautiful name.
There's no reason to be ashamed
of a $25 handle like that.
Maybe I'll just call you that all the time.
Bartholomew.
Sure you won't change your mind
and take another run at them?
No, I'm gonna visit my brother James
over in Wichita.
Meet his wife.
See if I can't figure out a better way
to make a living...
Than shooting a bunch of dumb animals.
Don't hold much future, that's for sure.
Not with every asshole in the territory
plugging away dawn till dusk.
That's us, ain't it?
Are all bets in?
Next card, loser is six, winner is eight.
- Just in time, sir.
- Thank you.
That's good, Wyatt.
Gentlemen, hold your bets
for the new dealer.
James.
- How's it going?
- I'm getting the hang of it.
I like that game.
I wouldn't mind owning a place,
I'll tell you that.
Last week you wanted to start
a stage line. Or was that the silver mine?
Now we're gonna have our own saloon.
All I know is there's not much future
in working for other people.
Who knows, Wyatt?
With what Bessie makes,
maybe we could get a bit together.
Hi, there.
She's my wife.
You know I don't like counting on women.
Hell, I'd count on Bessie
ahead of any man I know.
What you got against her, anyhow?
- She's a whore, James.
- Yes, she is, Wyatt.
And a hard-working one at that.
What are you doing with her?
Same thing everyone else
is doing with her.
Only difference is she doesn't charge me.
It doesn't bother you?
That she doesn't charge me?
No, I'm rather fond of the arrangement.
On a good day, I can even
get her to cook and clean a little.
- What was that? I didn't hear you.
- Nothing.
Your arrangement doesn't bother you,
I guess it doesn't bother me.
That's a big load off my mind.
I've been losing sleep worrying whether
or not my arrangement bothered you.
I got something for you!
- Where are you, big man?
- Look out!
What in tarnation?
What the hell's going on here?
Rowdy Dubbs is in the Iron Spike,
drunk and mad.
We think he's already shot one man.
Ford here has got to go in and get him.
It's your job, isn't it?
Not anymore.
They don't pay me enough
to commit suicide.
Give me.
I see you out there!
- My leg!
- Shut up.
I don't see anybody else in there,
but maybe you'd better check around.
- Young man, how'd you like a job?
- I got a job over at Pryor's dealing faro.
$75 a month.
I don't know. Being a deputy isn't...
I'll make it $100,
but don't hold me up for more.
$100?
What's the Marshal gonna say?
Marshal Meagher's
gonna like you just fine, Deputy.
This could be trouble.
Hold on, Mike. Don't shoot him.
- How are you, Wyatt?
- This is my no-good brother, Morgan.
As opposed
to your no-good brother, James.
- That's right.
- Morgan, meet Marshal Meagher.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Now take off those guns.
- Do what?
- Take off your guns.
Take them off.
- When did you get to town?
- About an hour ago.
- This boy would make one hell of a deputy.
- Might have an opening some time.
If we do, he can put them back on.
- It's really good to see you, Morgan.
- You, too, Wyatt.
Come on. I wanna show you something.
- Go ahead.
- Come on!
You're not gonna believe this.
Hold on to your hat.
Or maybe just take it off.
You decent, hon?
Here he is.
Lou, this is him.
This is my big brother.
- How do you do, ma'am?
- It's a pleasure to meet you, James.
This is Wyatt, not James.
We'll find James later.
Lou and I met in California
when I was out to see the folks.
Isn't she the sweetest thing
you've ever seen?
I believe she is.
Ma'am.
Don't shoot.
If you miss me,
it'd destroy your reputation.
Mister, I ain't in the mood.
Larry Deger from Dodge City.
People tell me you the man I'm looking for.
We used to see 30,000 head of cattle
come through in a season.
Hell, this year looks closer to 300,000.
Think about it.
- How much?
- $75 a month.
- I'm making more than that here.
- Plus $2.50 for every arrest.
I need help and lots of it.
Things are already out of hand.
- So you're looking for more than one?
- Hell, yes.
You know anyone you can trust?
I might know a few.
I'm Wyatt Earp.
Who?
Wyatt Earp!
Who the fuck is Wyatt Earp?
It appears to be just some asshole.
He's the asshole who enforces the law.
- There ain't no law in Dodge City.
- That's right.
Not for the Clements crew.
Stand down.
We've got some new laws
since you boys were here.
Tell them, Morgan.
All visitors will check their guns
immediately upon arrival.
That'll be the day.
No discharge of firearms
within the city limits...
except on the Fourth of July
and Christmas Day.
No riding into the stores...
saloons, the dance halls,
or the gambling houses.
And no public intoxication.
Mannen, what's that supposed to mean,
public intoxication?
I think what he means is
we done enough talking.
It means if you do anything
we don't much approve of...
we got a legal right to shoot you down.
You the one that's gonna try it?
Mr. Clements, your men respect you.
I don't wanna do anything
to take away from that.
I'm sure you've earned it.
So you and your boys
are welcome in Dodge City...
as long as you obey the law.
But if you don't wanna cooperate...
I'll open you up right now
with this shotgun so wide...
your whole crew's gonna see
what you had for breakfast.
After that it won't matter much
what happens next, will it?
Give up your guns, boys.
Only ones you need now
are sitting right between your legs.
- The job don't pay a salary to start.
- No salary?
Pays $2.50 for every arrest.
Wyatt cleared, what, $1,000 last month?
- Hell, how many is that?
- A lot.
You've got yourself
a bit of a reputation, Wyatt.
It's a tricky thing,
the reputation business, Bat.
I gotta tell you,
not all a man hears is good.
We heard about you
all the way over in Abilene.
What're they saying?
That people in Dodge are complaining
you're too quick to bash a man...
just 'cause you don't like the way he looks.
You just tell me what son of a bitch
is complaining, and I'll go bash him.
Look, there are plenty of people
around here who like Wyatt.
Let's see, there's me, there's Virgil...
You might as well get broke in sometime.
Why don't you boys handle this one?
- Evening.
- I understand, let me tell you...
Evening!
Looks like you boys
have been doing some drinking.
- Yeah? What makes you say that?
- Intuition, I guess.
Anyway, we're glad
you're having a good time...
but you know there is a city ordinance
against wearing firearms in town?
- Says who?
- Says the law, that's who.
Bat, you're being about as sociable
as an ulcerated molar.
These boys, they don't...
Shit, Wyatt!
You talk too much, Ed.
You didn't have to do that.
That fellow could've gone for his gun
after he saw you buffalo his friend.
Maybe.
He was so drunk he couldn't hit
the ground with his hat in three tries.
I'm just saying I believe
I could've talked those guns off him.
If I were you,
I'd look for another line of work.
Politics, maybe.
Ed's got a different style is all, Wyatt.
People like it.
You could get killed
in this line of work, Ed.
You could get people around you killed.
- We're just getting started.
- I know.
When I hit that fellow, your first instinct
was to pull your weapon and cover me.
This is a harsh land, Ed.
It doesn't suffer fools.
I'm not a fool, Wyatt.
No, you're not.
But you're not a deliberate man, Ed.
I don't sense that about you.
You're too affable.
Don't do that, Wyatt. Please.
- You know how I feel.
- I want to, Mattie.
I could make you happy. I know I could.
You just give me a chance.
I could be a wife to you.
I care for you, but I'm not gonna
tell you things that aren't true.
I don't wanna hurt you, Mattie,
but if seeing me causes you pain...
No.
We have time.
I have to give you time, that's all.
You'll see.
Only, don't leave money
on my dresser, please.
Unless it's 'cause you wanna
take care of me.
Is that how you mean it, Wyatt?
Wyatt, the mayor's asked us
to come and get you.
The mayor? Is something going on?
Some people are concerned about the way
you've been handling things.
What do you think, Ed?
There's been some complaints.
From some in jail, maybe,
not from citizens.
Some of them, too.
I'm just saying this out of friendship,
so you know.
All I know is the mayor wants to see you.
He asked us to find you.
That's what we did.
Donovan went all the way
to a title shot after that bout.
Don't know what shape I'd be in today
if you hadn't stopped that fight.
Drink?
What are you doing in these parts, Wyatt?
I thought you was
the Deputy Marshal in Dodge.
I was...
till the city fathers
forgot to renew my contract.
Too much of a hard-ass, I guess.
You are. Everybody knows that.
- Who replaced you?
- A fellow named Masterson.
Bat Masterson?
No, his brother Ed.
- What's he like?
- He's affable.
Very affable.
What are you up to?
I'm doing a job for the railroad.
Looking for a fellow,
name of Dave Rudabaugh. Know him?
- Yeah.
- I heard he might be headed this way.
He come through here all right,
but where he went I couldn't tell you.
What'd he do?
He robbed the Santa Fe train three times,
looks like.
There is somebody
who might know something.
If he does, he'll probably tell you.
He hates Rudabaugh.
- His name's Doc Holliday.
- He's a killer, isn't he?
He's killed some.
He owes me a couple of favors
and he's as good as his word.
He's dying of tuberculosis.
He travels with a whore
named Big Nose Kate...
but he's not her pimp.
You take me to him?
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine,
Wyatt Earp.
I've heard that name somewhere.
Don't know where, but it wasn't good.
Mind if we sit down?
I'm looking for Dave Rudabaugh.
There's a reward for information
about him leading to his arrest.
Are you a lawman?
You are not wearing a badge.
Are you ashamed of your profession?
I myself was a dentist.
I was proud to be a dentist.
I did not hide the fact that I was a dentist.
How are your teeth, Wyatt Earp?
They're working all right.
Take good care of them.
They cannot be replaced.
I'm no longer a dentist.
I'm a sporting man. That's my work now.
In Georgia, we were taught
that a man should take pride in his work.
Have you ever been to Georgia?
Beautiful state, Georgia.
Very green. I was forced to leave Georgia.
I fear that I will never see it again.
I'm sorry.
Do you believe in friendship?
So do I.
Do you have many friends?
John here has been a friend to me
when most men were not.
Dave Rudabaugh is an ignorant scoundrel.
I disapprove of his very existence.
I considered ending it myself
on several occasions...
but self-control got the better of me.
Besides, I'm a sporting man...
not a killer.
Tell me about the reward, Wyatt Earp.
You'd be doing me a favor
if you would call me either Wyatt or Earp.
Not both.
All right.
Wyatt.
Call me Doc.
Hey, bartender.
Howdy, friend.
You ain't my friend.
True enough, but I am the law here...
and the law says that you can't wear
the gun in town. Hand it over.
What if I don't?
I'll have to take it away from you.
You'll go to jail. You'll miss the party.
You don't want that, now, do you?
Give it to me!
Don't give it back till they leave town.
Thank you.
- I'll sure do that.
- Okay, good. You have a good night.
- That one laying over there.
- I didn't see who it was.
Bat, I'm shot.
Oh, God.
Let's go.
My name is Wyatt Earp.
It all ends now!
Hello, Doc.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
Kate Elder.
- Nice to meet you, Miss Elder.
- Charmed, I'm sure.
You can call me Big Nose Kate.
Everybody else does.
No, it's not that big.
- All kinds of reasons a person gets a name.
- I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
This is my brother Virgil.
Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday.
You're the man that killed
Sgt. King in Sweetwater.
Got you in the leg, I understand.
My congratulations to you, sir.
King was a skunk of the first order.
I wish you'd got him
before he shot poor Molly Brennan.
- She was a sweet girl.
- Yes, she was, ma'am.
- So what brings you to Dodge City, Doc?
- I guess I missed you, Wyatt.
This is where the money is.
Anything else?
Perhaps you've heard.
We had an unfortunate incident
in Fort Griffin...
entirely beyond our control.
It seemed a good time to move on.
I hope we won't have
anything unfortunate happen in Dodge.
Likewise, I'm sure.
I'll be checking my gun
as soon as we find a suitable hotel.
I look forward
to more civilized surroundings.
Gentlemen.
Maybe he ought to check his knife, too.
I heard he cut that man in Texas
from his belly to his dick.
Bye.
I don't know what you want, Wyatt.
This setup seems pretty sweet to me.
We're making good money. We might get
a piece of the Alhambra Faro Bank.
Virgil, there's never been a man
that got rich working on a salary.
That much I've learned.
If you wanted to get rich,
you went into the wrong line of work.
That's what I'm saying.
Think it's gonna be any different
in Tombstone?
Can't say, but there's silver there.
And opportunity.
The town's booming.
They're gonna need saloons, stage lines,
hotels, you name it.
Wyatt, did it ever occur to you...
that maybe we're doing the only thing
that we're any good at?
Goodbye, Allie. I'll see you a little later.
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.
- Where you going?
- Allie says they wanna talk to you alone.
Thanks for coming, Wyatt.
You're probably wondering
what this is about.
You're damn right.
We've been talking.
We like it here in Dodge.
We want you to stop talking to
our husbands about going to Tombstone.
All that nonsense about mining claims
and starting your own businesses.
They all listen to you, Wyatt.
They'll do what you say.
I know Morgan will.
We'd like you
to just leave well enough alone.
Just for once,
let the Earps settle down somewhere.
Is that right?
You brought me here to tell me that
without my brothers?
Stop talking and start shooting.
- They're upstairs.
- It's that goddamn Holliday and his whore.
Where is it? Where'd you put it?
Never again, you bastard.
You've raised your hand to me
for the last time!
It's Wyatt! I'm coming in!
Don't shoot me!
Where'd you hide it?
Come on, little dove.
Let's finally get it over with.
Don't think I won't,
you skinny heap of pus.
I won't have you hit me ever again.
Put that gun down, Kate.
I don't want you shooting me by mistake.
Year after year, sleeping in his bed...
breathing the diseased air
he coughs up all night!
No one else would come near him.
This is what I get!
This is his idea of a fair hand!
- You won't be shooting him tonight, Kate.
- Let her do it.
They can hang the bitch.
We'll both be happy.
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?
What have you got?
I am dying of tuberculosis.
Everyone who knows me hates me.
I sleep with the nastiest whore
in Kansas...
and every morning I wake up surprised.
Surprised I have to spend another day
in this piss hole world.
Not everybody that knows you hates you.
What were you fighting about this time?
I don't recall.
But like most times
when Kate and I disagree...
we set to killing each other.
All of you can kiss my rebel dick.
I know sometimes it isn't easy
being my friend...
but I'll be there when you need me.
They say it was the biggest funeral
in Dodge's history.
Of course, the town ain't that old.
People liked Ed.
We've covered some ground, haven't we?
What is it, Wyatt?
I've had it with being a lawman, Bat.
I've had enough of being famous.
I'm sick of Dodge.
What are you two doing?
Can't you wait to get in here?
We're saying goodbye.
I'm leaving Dodge, Doc.
Hallelujah. I'll drink to that.
I'm gonna settle down.
Start some kind of business where nobody
wants to shoot me anymore.
My brothers and I are going.
- You're both welcome to come along.
- Where's that?
Tombstone, Arizona.
It does sound quiet, I'll give you that.
The man we've been waiting for.
- Come on in.
- Here you go.
- Set it right down on that bench, son.
- Okay.
Our savior has arrived.
Yeah. Here you go.
- Thank you, Mr. Earp.
- You're welcome.
Morg, honey. Food's ready.
- Come on, sweetie.
- I'll be right there, little darling.
