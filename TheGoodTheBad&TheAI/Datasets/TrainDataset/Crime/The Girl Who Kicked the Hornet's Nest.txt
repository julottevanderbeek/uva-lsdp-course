You came here to kill me.
From precinct 80: the suspect Niedermann
should be regarded as extremely dangerous.
Exercise extreme caution.
All patrols acknowledge.
Over.
Eight - one - two - zero.
Are you receiving? Over.
Her name is Lisbeth Salander.
She is 27 years old.
In this edition of Millennium we reveal...
...how Swedish government officials
have conspired against her...
...to cover up a criminally insane murderer:
Alexander Zalachenko, a turncoat GRU agent
from the Soviet Union.
In Sweden he has committed serious crimes:
arms smuggling, drug dealing,
money laundering, assault.
Alexander Zalachenko is
Lisbeth Salander's father.
This edition of Millennium
tells her side of the story.
Hello.
Can you open your eyes?
My name is Anders Jonasson.
I am your doctor.
You are at the Sahlgrenska
hospital in Göteborg.
Can you count to ten?
One, two, three...
That's okay.
My article is about 40 to 50 pages long.
It will contain extracts from
Björck's investigation...
...to make it stronger, more convincing.
What images have we got?
- Not much.
We can get pictures of Gunnar Björck,
Teleborian and Zalachenko.
And some of St. Stephen's Hospital.
- Yes, and of Lisbeth.
It sounds like at least 75 pages.
- It may be more. It will be good.
Can we find more names?
- No, we must focus on what we have.
Let's hope that the publication
brings out other names.
That will be only a matter of time,
and then...
Let's get to work now.
Breaking news: police have mobilised extra forces
after the murder near Gosseberga this morning.
A massive manhunt is being undertaken
for the suspect.
Police have identified him...
...as Ronald Niedermann, a 35 year old German.
According to police he is armed
and very dangerous.
I am looking for Fredrik Clinton.
- Who shall I say is calling?
Evert Gullberg, an old colleague.
Dad is sleeping, but come inside please.
Zalachenko will do what is best for himself,
whatever the consequences.
It is also about my reputation.
We cannot risk him talking.
We need to silence him at any cost.
We agree. Like we usually do.
You can see what condition I am in.
Fredrik, we need you.
One last time.
I can't.
Every other day I stay five hours...
...at the hospital for haemodialysis.
I will die soon!
I cannot get a new kidney.
That's how it is, my friend.
Thank you, my dear.
- They are freshly baked.
I did not know you had a daughter.
No...
We don't know much about
each other's private lives.
Although we have worked together...
...oh yes, more than 35 years.
What about Lisbeth Salander?
The prosecution process has already started.
What will we do with her?
Hello Lisbeth.
How's it going?
Do you remember me?
Anders Jonasson is my name.
I understand if you're tired.
You were shot in the head.
We managed to remove the bullet.
It has not damaged any vital areas,
as far as we know.
You also had gunshot wounds in
your right shoulder and left hip.
But it will heal nicely.
What about brain damage?
Brain injuries are complex and sometimes
difficult to detect. Don't worry.
The police want to talk with you.
But I said no
because of your condition
They're bound to return, but right
now I will not let them see you.
Did Zalachenko survive?
He has been patched up and is stable.
But he is rather seriously injured.
Shit.
I was wondering when you would show up.
We have discussed how we can help you.
But to develop a strategy,
we must first hear your version.
What should the strategy look like?
We will find a way out together.
However, it will be hard to keep
you out of prison completely.
No shit?
We will help you with a lawyer
and everything else you need.
But you must cooperate
and give us some guarantees.
Niedermann...
Niedermann is the scapegoat.
It was he who shot Lisbeth.
There are serious allegations against you
which can be difficult to discount.
That's your problem...
...it's entirely your problem.
If you do not solve it...
...I will contact the press.
I have names, dates, events...
everything.
I can crush all of you completely.
I am a survivor,
you ought to know that by now.
Zalachenko, you do not understand...
- It is you who doesn't understand!
This conversation is over.
Just one more thing.
Lisbeth...
What is wrong with her?
- She has to be put out of the way, understood?
Good. Good...
Hello. Sorry I'm late.
My sister has arrived.
We'll talk later.
Is there no one at home?
- No.
However, Micke, she tried
to beat her father to death with an axe.
And that's attempted murder.
Or self-defence.
But she has been arrested for the attempted
murder of Zalachenko, right?
Therefore she will need a criminal lawyer.
Your practice is women's rights.
Lisbeth and her mother were exposed
to mistreatment and abuse...
...by Zalachenko and by the authorities.
It started long before Gosseberga.
Here are documents that confirm it.
A copy of the investigation, consolidated by
an agent of the Security Service: Gunnar Björck.
It proves how illegal it was to lock up
a twelve-year-old girl at St. Stephen's...
...and to silence her.
Is this confidential?
Just tell them you have it from a journalist
who doesn't want to reveal the origin.
You really want to go to that extreme
for Lisbeth Salander, don't you?
Yes.
SJ's X2000 No. 429 from Stockholm
has arrived at platform number 6.
I do not need a lawyer.
You will be accused of the attempted murder
of your father.
Micke thinks that they will try to
lock you away in a mental hospital again...
...so you will need a lawyer.
However, you do have a choice.
If you don't want the court to
appoint a public lawyer.
Does your silence mean
I should go?
You decide.
Do you have a cigarette?
Do you have a nicotine patch?
- Yes, one moment please.
I got this copy from Micke.
You know what's in it, don't you?
We will need to talk
with each other a lot.
So, I want you to be completely
honest with me.
Micke told me most of it,
but on some matters he wants you...
...to decide what you want to tell.
I assume you know what he means.
It's something to do with
computers and a DVD.
After everything we've done for you
over the years...
...you are threatening us.
That's a big risk.
I am a survivor. I do what I think is
necessary to survive.
No, you do it because you are an evil
and wicked man without honour.
Without morality.
I came here to give you our message.
We will not help you this time.
So there!
I have no choice.
Don't you understand that?
Life has taught me
that there's always a choice.
Idiots.
I crush you.
- You will not do anything.
No, lie still. Please!
I'll see what's going on.
Get out!
He has a gun!
What's going on?
Hurry!
Wait, I'm coming.
Hold me tightly.
Hold me.
Hold me tightly!
He pulled the door, but could
not open it. It was so surreal.
An old man with a gun.
Then I heard the shot
when he killed himself.
Are you sure that he tried
to get hold of Lisbeth?
Yes, it was awful!
I have never been so scared.
Do you want me to come down?
- No.
That's not necessary. I will stay with
my friend Vera Åkerlund in Kålltorp.
Press conference at police headquarters at 15.
- I'll have to run.
Look after yourself.
- Yes.
We'll talk later.
- Yes. Bye.
Why didn't the police
set up a better watch?
Absolutely incredible. You wouldn't think
such things could happen here.
To go armed into a hospital department and
kill a patient, is really unbelievable!
Well I never! Fredrik?
What in the world's happened?
Come in please, come in.
We're trying to get information
about it now.
What time was it?
Find out.
What the hell?
Do you know what happened?
- Zalachenko has been shot.
It seems Evert Gullberg shot him.
It's chaos down there.
Nothing has been confirmed.
Then I will confirm it.
It was Evert who shot him.
Just as planned.
Would you like coffee or something?
- No, not now.
What the hell are you talking about?
What plans?
Gullberg had only a few months
left to live. He had liver cancer.
He chose to make one last effort for us.
He died with honour.
Did you know he would kill Zalachenko?
- Of course.
His mission was to silence Zalachenko.
And Salander, like it was planned.
Are you as fucking deranged as Gullberg?
Watch your tongue, Hallberg.
It was the right decision.
We did what was necessary.
- Necessary? Decision?
You and Gullberg had no mandate to
take any decision at all, damn it!
Whatever happens: Zalachenko's death
will never be related to us.
Nor Evert Gullberg's.
Our task is to take decisions...
...that no one else dares.
Least of all politicians.
It's that simple.
One more thing...
I will return to action.
I will lead the operational activities...
...until this crisis is over.
The man who fired the deadly
shot and later took his own life...
...has been identified as a
He has worked as an accountant
and tax lawyer.
What was his name?
- We can not disclose that right now.
Is there a connection with
Lisbeth Salander?
We can firmly deny a possible link
with Lisbeth Salander.
It seemed to be a single assailant
who has acted...
...based upon his own paranoid
imagination.
He has sent confused messages,
to famous politicians and media...
...with death threats against
Alexander Zalachenko.
The Security Service has analyzed it,
but the man was probably mentally ill.
That concludes the police press conference.
We return to the incidents at
Sahlgrenska hospital in Göteborg.
No!
Dinner?
- Indeed. Salisbury steak today.
Go ahead.
- Thank you.
Lisbeth?
Do you need help?
- No thanks.
Eat up now.
I have a suggestion.
I'm not driving home.
I have booked a room.
Will you stay overnight?
I'm completely exhausted.
I slept poorly on the editorial shift.
Then we just sleep.
It's the fourth time that car
has been there.
Are you sure?
- Yes.
How do you propose to solve this?
- We could not anticipate everything.
The guarding of the hospital has been tightened.
- Fucking thanks for that!
How the hell are you going to
avoid a trial now?
I do not think we can.
Only locked doors and a psychiatric
assessment will confine her.
She must be punished for the
attempted murder of Zalachenko...
...and admitted to secure psychiatric care.
And why not here at St. Stephen's?
- Yes.
For no other reason than for her own sake.
What is the name of the prosecutor?
Ekström.
Not a star, but ambitious.
We can handle him.
And what about the copies of Björck's
investigation? - We're collecting them now.
You should be easily capable of that.
You worry too much.
And that blond muscleman
who worked for Zalachenko?
What happened to him?
- Ronald Niedermann.
He is on the run.
It's just a matter of time.
He is Lisbeth Salander's half-brother.
Zalachenko had an affair
with a woman in Hamburg.
It sounds like a goddamned Greek tragedy.
Zalachenko tried to kill his daughter
with the help of her brother.
Then she returned from the dead...
...and put an axe in her father's head.
Yes, you might think of it that way.
You will hear from me.
See you again, Vera. Bye.
Hey!
Give me back the bag!
Give me my bag!
What the hell...!
Someone on a scooter snatched my bag.
What? How are you then?
Are you okay?
I am fine. But Björck's investigation
was in the bag.
Don't worry. I'll make a copy.
Annika, I'll call you again.
Milton Security, Armanskij.
This is Mikael Blomkvist.
I need your help.
What is the problem?
- Someone has broken into my house.
We can help you with that.
Can I call you from my office?
Of course, call me from your mobile.
- Okay, bye.
The indictment against Lisbeth Salander
is not complicated.
Even if the plaintiff Zalachenko is dead.
However, if everything about Zalachenko comes out,
then it's going to be a very complicated trial.
It is about human lives, about our
relationship with a foreign power...
...and the secret contacts of
the Security Service.
Yes, I've read the report as
background material.
For the prosecution of Lisbeth Salander
the report has little relevance...
...and the Director of Public Prosecutions
has confiscated it.
Nevertheless, parts of it are useful.
Especially where Lisbeth Salander tried
to assassinate her father in the past.
I will see if you can have access
to that part.
Yes, it might be beneficial.
Then I will ensure that you get it.
Who is your superior?
My orders come from the very top.
This means that you cannot talk
to anyone about this but me.
I will be very discreet.
Anders Jonasson?
- Yes.
My name is Peter Teleborian.
I am a doctor at St. Stephen's
psychiatric clinic in Uppsala.
I need to talk to you.
It is about one of your patients,
Lisbeth Salander.
I see...
- Well... okay.
I have been dealing with her
since she was twelve years old...
...and I have a very good understanding
of her clinical picture.
What does it look like?
- Lisbeth is seriously mentally disturbed.
She has overt delusions
with paranoid and schizophrenic features.
And like all sociopaths
she completely lacks empathy.
To put it simply.
I perceive her as a closed person,
but not as a paranoid sociopath.
She is extremely manipulative,
which is part of the disease picture.
She shows what she thinks you want to see.
As you will understand, I feel great
concern about her mental condition.
Yes, I understand.
I'll have to see her to assess
her condition before the trial.
I cannot help you with that.
I am responsible for Lisbeth.
She is not strong enough to
meet anyone other than her lawyer.
I have been instructed by the
prosecutor to meet with her.
I had hoped to avoid being formal,
but now I suppose I'll have to be.
As a doctor you should know that
it's my assessment that applies...
...regardless of prosecutor decisions.
Therefore, you will have to be patient
and wait until I change my assessment.
Well...
I had hoped for a more
professional response.
Can we rule out government
knowledge of it?
They must have known that a Russian spy
defected to Sweden.
We had a conservative government in '76
when Zalachenko defected.
It could not be kept secret, if a lot
of politicians were aware of it.
A lot of them write biographies now.
The same goes for the Security Service.
It would have leaked out sooner or later.
There must be a small secret group
acting on their own.
With substantial resources and influence.
If nobody has leaked about the group in
The best lead we have is Evert Gullberg.
If we find out more about him, there is a
chance of getting somewhere.
However, it must not take too long
or Millennium will be in trouble.
The magazine must be out simultaneously
with the trial.
Keep your eye on this, please.
How am I doing?
- You are clearly improving.
I will ensure that you get help
to get started with rehabilitation.
I do not need help.
- You do. Don't scratch the scab.
Moreover, you should eat better.
You should do something about the food.
The food?
- Get me a pizza or something like that.
I doubt the budget is sufficient for pizza.
A Dr. Peter Teleborian wanted to see you.
He said that you'd had contact in the past.
Anyway, he had to leave empty-handed.
Good...
Apparently this is for you.
Hello. We met at the hospital the
night Lisbeth Salander was brought in.
Yes, I do remember.
- I want to talk to you about something.
I will not disclose information
about Lisbeth Salander.
No, I want to give you information about
Lisbeth. Important information.
A conspiracy like that... sorry,
but it sounds very unlikely.
I understand that you see it that way,
but I assure you: everything is true.
Everything can be documented
and I will publish the whole story.
I built Lisbeth's defence for her trial.
That's why I am here.
I'm only going to ask you about one thing.
- What?
Lisbeth has secrets.
Private ones. She may need them
for her defence.
To access the evidence she will need this.
The prosecutor has imposed restrictions.
- That's why I'm asking you.
Hi, how are you doing?
- Fine.
May I give you a brief examination?
- Yes.
Let's have a look...
Do you feel any pain?
- No.
What about headaches?
- Not bad.
They are disappearing gradually.
- That's good.
The Stockholm police called again.
Hans Faste was his name. He described himself
as in charge of the investigation.
He wanted to come here and interrogate you.
Can you bend your head slightly backwards?
Not too far. I was a little annoyed
that they are so persistent.
I cannot use your medical condition
to refuse him much longer.
You are improving rapidly.
Do you understand?
I told him that you need a couple of
weeks more to rehabilitate.
You will then be moved to
jail in Stockholm.
I saw the tattoo on your back.
It seems quite large.
Why did you get it done?
- Why do you ask?
Pure curiosity.
- For private reasons I will not discuss.
Okay. Sorry.
It must have hurt and taken time.
Yes, to both.
Excuse me.
Hello Lisbeth. With this you can tell
your version of what happened.
Your autobiography.
Annika doesn't know that you have your PDA now,
and it's better to keep it that way.
Should I give her the DVD?
We also need to know more about Teleborian.
I live in your apartment.
Mine is under surveillance and probably bugged.
Murder suspect Lisbeth Salander will be
transferred from Sahlgrenska in Göteborg...
...to Kronoberg prison in Stockholm
as soon as her condition allows...
...according to a police spokesman.
The trial is scheduled for the beginning
of November this year.
Plague, are you there?
It's okay to give the DVD to Annika.
However, I will write about the rape myself.
I have contacted Plague about Teleborian.
He will contact you if he finds something.
I have a link to the government.
Guess who visited the Prime Minister at the
Cabinet Office on October 5, 1976?
No takers? Evert Gullberg and a person named
Hans von Rottinger.
They were there three weeks after
Zalachenko defected.
How did you find out?
- I checked the visitor's book.
There was only one visit, on October 5, 1976.
Well done, Christer.
Nevertheless, it must be proved that they were
there to provide information on Zalachenko.
Were there any notes?
- No, just names and dates.
How do we proceed?
- We must check the Secretaries of State.
Two people who worked there might know something.
- Do we have any names?
One is dead and the other one is
a retired ambassador.
His name is Bengt Janeryd
and he lives outside Grisslehamn.
We should have a chat with him.
- Good. I'll take care of that.
I know the case better than you do,
so I am more dangerous to him.
It's just what I say.
- Yes, I heard what you said...
Address?
Okay.
And you...
...well done!
You must know that Gullberg
has shot Zalachenko, right?
Did you read it in the newspapers?
- Yes.
Why didn't you call the cops?
- I waited for them to call.
That sounds a little convenient.
- I knew nothing about his daughter.
What she suffered is terrible.
However, the prime minister was not aware of it.
Neither was I.
You'd better convince me and
the Millennium readers about that.
I forbid you to use my name in this context.
I didn't have anything to do with it.
What I read here is new to me.
You have read only some of the material
we will publish. We have a lot more.
Everything can be proved.
I will not hang you out, but you have a
responsibility and a liability.
So either you tell me now, or you keep
hiding behind your confidentiality.
That's what I call blackmail.
- Call it whatever you want.
If you talk, I promise you
not to mention your name.
Did the prime minister have contact with
Evert Gullberg and Hans von Rottinger?
Did you also contact them?
- Yes.
There was one more, named Clinton,
like the American president.
Clinton?
- Yes.
How often did you meet?
A dozen times during my time as
a Secretary of State.
I didn't know anything.
Only that Zalachenko collaborated...
...and that the information he gave
was invaluable.
Who took over the connection then?
I do not know.
You did not brief anyone?
- No.
And you didn't write any report?
No, everything was top secret, of course.
I didn't even take notes during meetings.
So, no subsequent government
had any idea...
...that there was a Soviet defector
in Sweden?
It might sound strange,
but that's how it was.
What's up Plague?
- We have a problem.
I have checked Teleborian's hard disk
and e-mail but found nothing.
Nothing?
- Nothing about you or the trial.
The only thing that might be interesting
are two short e-mails...
...sent by Jonas through Hotmail.
"PSU 1 ready next week".
It is from September 20 this year.
The second is equally brief:
"PSU 2 ready tomorrow".
PSU? Psychiatric opinion?
Yes, it could be.
No files?
- No.
He did not send anything
from his work computer.
He probably has a laptop
with mobile broadband.
It may be difficult to access.
- But not impossible?
At the right time, anything is possible.
I will keep an eye on his mailbox.
- Do it. But don't call me again.
Send me an SMS or e-mail.
- Okay, bye.
Damn it!
Hello, Mikael Blomkvist. I am Monica Figuerola,
Constitutional Protection Unit.
Yes?
- I would like to invite you for a talk.
It is a friendly invitation.
You don't risk anything.
Can I get my mail first?
- Of course.
And a pair of clean underpants?
- Absolutely.
Torsten Edklinth, Constitutional Protection
Unit.
Blomkvist.
- Please, take a seat.
You probably understand
why we want to meet you.
So let's get to the point.
We have received confirmation that there
exists a secret group, a conspiracy...
...in an exceptionally sensitive area
of state administration.
My meeting with the Prime Minister yesterday
evening has resulted in a full investigation.
Which means...?
A complete investigation.
The result will go to the General Prosecutor, who
will decide whether prosecution should be instituted.
However, we need time to identify
those who are involved.
I understand that.
Where do I have a part in it?
We want to know when you plan to publish.
If it takes place before the investigation is
completed, it could jeopardize the whole operation.
When do you think that I can publish?
Of course we cannot determine that yet.
It is entirely up to you, but I
ask you to cooperate.
Let me tell you this...
The state, the government, the Secret Service:
they all piss me off...
...and all the other fucking assholes
who locked up a twelve-year-old girl...
...in a mental hospital, for no reason at all,
and kept her legally incompetent.
I myself am very upset about
what happened to Lisbeth Salander.
But those who are responsible will be punished.
But before that, we must identify
who is involved.
That's exactly what I want as well.
But I also want to get Lisbeth Salander
acquitted and be declared legally competent.
Of course there will be no intervention by us
nor by the government, as you will understand.
Provided that I will get full access
to the results of your investigation...
...you can tell me what to publish and when.
Information in exchange for information.
This can be solved quite easily.
We decide which co-workers we
recruit for the investigation.
We can recruit Mikael Blomkvist
as an external consultant.
Evert Gullberg.
Do you have any other names?
Hans von Rottinger, Frederick Clinton.
One is dead, the other has retired.
Both were active in the group during the
'70 and '80s. - Group?
Can we give it a working title?
Maybe we should call it "the Section".
The Section? Okay.
How did you find out about them?
I have a reliable source.
Should it come up with the working title?
- Absolutely, I agree with that.
I was strapped onto the bed.
Peter Teleborian stood next to the bed.
He smelled of aftershave.
I hated his smell.
I heard his breathing change
and saw his mouth move.
But I didn't understand what he said.
I hated his mouth.
It was the night I became 13 years old.
Niedermann is your brother.
Come on Buster, search!
Yes, search.
- 80-1651 , come in.
Come in, 1651 .
We have searched the lower floor.
It's empty.
Someone has broken into the house
next-door, but the police are present.
Do you need something to help you sleep?
Lisbeth tried several times
to tell the social services...
...about Zalachenko's abuse
of her mother...
...but nobody took the ten year old
girl's accusations seriously.
To save her mother Lisbeth eventually tried
to kill her father...
...by throwing a milk carton
with petrol onto his face...
...and then a burning match.
Then society reacted.
But not by punishing
Alexander Zalachenko.
Instead, Lisbeth was punished.
Twelve years old, she was locked up at St. Stephen's
psychiatric hospital in Uppsala.
When she came out, she was declared legally
incompetent and placed under guardianship.
It's me.
Teleborian will meet with Jonas
at 1600 in the centre.
What time is it now?
- Nearly half past three.
Damn it!
Hello. I have to take some blood tests.
- I just need to go to the toilet.
Yes, Christer.
- I'm in the middle of the staircase.
Yes, I see you now.
I'm just below.
I see Teleborian in the centre of the hall.
Christer, go ahead. I will stay here.
Okay.
You should see him soon.
Black jacket.
I see him now.
He's standing and waiting.
Keep an eye on him, but not too close.
- No, I'm just watching him.
Someone is coming. It must be Jonas.
Gray jacket, middle-aged.
I do not recognize him.
Now they are leaving. Should I tag along?
- Yes, follow them!
They're going out to Vasagatan.
- Keep following them.
Mikael here. Teleborian is meeting
someone who works for the Section.
Okay, where?
- At Vasagatan. Are you coming?
Okay. Yes, I'm coming.
Hi.
- Hello.
They are there.
Mikael here.
- They are leaving now.
Follow Teleborian.
We will follow the other one.
Monica here.
I need information on a car.
Guess who went through the same door
four hours ago.
Fredrik Clinton.
Teleborian's statement?
- It's a draft.
It needs to be edited,
but it looks good.
Did Teleborian go from a meeting with
Jonas Sandberg of the Section...
...to a meeting at the police station?
With whom?
- We'll find out.
Jonas Sandberg joined the security department
in 1998. For counter-espionage.
In 2001 he was transferred
to a secret location abroad.
He should be working at the embassy in
Madrid, but they have never heard of him.
These are the Section's properties.
A block of apartments, six floors,
I have checked all tenants
but nothing unusual came out.
Additionally there is the top flat.
A company named Bellona owns it.
The owners live abroad.
Can we get a camera up there?
- Do we have permission for that?
I will get permission for that,
if you manage to get a pot of tea.
Never mind, I'll make one at home.
Hello.
- Hi.
Am I interrupting?
- Yes.
I'll be back.
- I have nearly finished it.
I just wanted to warn you
that the police are coming tomorrow.
Okay.
I could delay a couple of days, but...
...my colleagues would wonder.
- So let it go.
Are you sure?
- Yes.
You do not seem particularly worried.
- No.
I have a present for you.
Why?
You have been one of my most
entertaining patients in a long time.
In case you should get bored in jail...
The latest clamour against DNA research.
Your mobile phone...
- It's in the chocolate box.
Teleborian will write an expert opinion.
He will conclude that you need
secure psychiatric care.
The prosecutor has requested the report.
So, we'll have to hire our own expert
who will come with his own opinion.
Lisbeth, it's for your own good.
I will not talk to any shrink.
I have already said that.
I hope they will fit.
The only one who will lose by it,
is you.
Lisbeth...
Stand back for Lisbeth Salander.
How are you, Salander?
- Lisbeth...
Do you have any comments?
Today murder suspect Lisbeth Salander has
been transferred under police escort...
...from Sahlgrenska in Göteborg
to Kronoberg prison in Stockholm.
According to prosecutor Richard Ekström
the trial...
...has been scheduled for November 6.
Lisbeth Salander was arrested...
...on suspicion of attempted murder of
her father, Alexander Zalachenko...
...who was brutally murdered at
Sahlgrenska Hospital subsequently.
There will be increased security
in connection with the trial...
...following threats during
the police investigation.
Sonny? When the hell did you get out?
- This morning.
Magge too?
- No, he'll have to stay a little longer.
Good to see you again.
The police raided us
the day you were arrested.
They found nothing. Later on that blond
bastard dropped in and wanted a hideaway...
...you know: your and Magge's buddy.
He is not my buddy, damn it!
He is wanted throughout Sweden.
So that's why he needed a hideout.
I have sent him to Viktor's place.
Fuck...
Sonny!
What the hell...
Jenny... Jenny!
Jenny!
Jenny? It's me, Sonny.
Who was it?
Nied...
Niedermann.
Viktor, Viktor...
Niedermann...
He will fucking die for this.
He will fucking die for this!
"Lisbeth Salander's autobiography"...
Can anyone prove what's written there?
- Impossible. They don't have any proof.
Blomkvist is no fool.
Nor is Erika Berger.
We must address it more thoroughly
to tie them up.
Press the green button.
We do not have much time.
We must increase the pressure.
Who's turn is it today?
- It's Malin's, right?
Hi. How's it going?
You want sushi?
- No fish. Chicken teriyaki for me.
Are you going to have lunch, Micke?
- No, I don't have time.
Okay. Erika, eight pieces?
Can I replace the battery with yours?
Mine is flat.
Micke... have a look.
It's someone anonymous. I think it's from
the same sender as last time.
Have you got many?
- I got one last week.
Why didn't you say anything?
- I didn't take it seriously.
We keep it between us. Let's talk more
about it later today.
May I take it then?
- Take it.
Would you like to have eight pieces?
- I'm not so hungry today.
I will skip a meal.
Time to go to the hearing.
Well, so we finally meet.
Ekström, prosecutor.
We see this initial meeting more
like a conversation than an interrogation.
A way to bring some order
in the complicated story.
I'm assuming that you don't have
anything against it.
The charges against you are serious.
However, as a prosecutor I have to take into
account all mitigating circumstances.
It is important that you are aware of that,
for your own sake.
This is a simple question.
Answer yes or no.
When you went to Gosseberga
to meet your daddy...
...did you already have plans then
to kill him?
Then I will ask the defence again
to encourage her client respond.
Then I repeat that my client decides
whether she wants to answer.
I must ask the defence to have a serious
conversation with Miss Salander.
I say this for the defendent's own sake.
Well...
I was surprised that she was so small
and delicate, like a little girl.
The trial begins on the 13th.
The magazine has to be ready then.
We need to go to press the week before.
How will we be able to do that?
- We must help each other.
You and Malin write about Teleborian's
background and a bit about St. Stephen's.
Approximately 30 pages. Is that okay?
Yes, that's fine.
- Good.
Well...
Then there is another thing.
I have received two anonymous e-mails...
...during the past week,
which you should know about.
Threats?
Shit!
Which damned fool has sent them?
Did you notify the police about it?
- I don't want the police here.
It is a serious threat towards Erika.
We take it very seriously. But I don't want
to have the cops here at the office.
So, you just want to ignore it?
- That's not what I say.
I will solve it my way.
- How?
The police will not care about it.
They don't give a shit!
Please, stop! My God!
I didn't get any more of them, and no harm has
been done. So let's forget about it.
Next item.
- 30 pages.
What about Lisbeth Salander?
- She's doing fine, under the circumstances.
What do you say about the accusations?
- No comment.
You've got to defend her and
surely must have something to say.
Hello my sweethearts. You're eating there?
Sorry I'm late.
Good that you've eaten already.
I'm sure you will enjoy this.
It's Lisbeth's autobiography.
What? When did she write it?
That doesn't matter.
"Bjurman"?
Is that Lisbeth's guardian?
What is this?
- It's a movie.
Have a look at it yourself.
Lisbeth approved it's use during
the trial, if it comes in handy.
You want some?
Is Lisbeth Salander healthy now?
- Yes, she can be interrogated now.
Physically she is fine.
- But maybe not mentally?
It is known that Lisbeth Salander has been
treated in mental hospitals for several years.
You think that Lisbeth Salander
is still mentally ill?
I'm not able to diagnose her case.
I have asked for a psychiatric
investigation to find the answer.
Who will be the doctor?
- Peter Teleborian.
He is chief psychiatrist
at St. Stephen's hospital.
Peter Teleborian...
what a surprise.
Christer?
Is it from the same sender?
- Yes.
"It's getting worse now. For all of you".
Is that about us?
Has Micke already tried to trace the sender?
- He called somebody.
That didn't help much.
We must call and report it.
We cannot just wait for something to happen.
- I want to talk to Mikael first.
I will call him right now.
- No. I am the responsible publisher.
Moreover, I am the one who received those e-mails.
I will not act behind Mikael's back.
We must stick together.
And be united. Especially now.
I'll call Mikael.
Mikael Blomkvist. I cannot reply now,
but please leave a message.
Micke, where the hell are you?
I've received another e-mail.
Now it's not just about me.
It feels extremely uncomfortable.
Call me back!
Hello Lisbeth.
You should know that I am sorry
that you got into this situation.
I'll try to help you
in all possible ways.
I hope that we can cooperate,
you and me.
I thought we got acquainted
pretty well, you and me.
During that time.
You were a stubborn...
...and extremely difficult to treat
twelve-year-old girl.
You bit my finger once.
Do you remember?
You never understood that touch
was part of the treatment...
...and that it creates closeness and trust.
This applies in particular to children.
Do you realize that I am the person...
...who has the greatest potential
to help you?
Don't you?
Hi. Are you still here?
- I called your cellphone several times.
I was writing and had it turned off.
The same sender.
Christer tried to call the police today.
But I stopped him.
We must fix this right now, Mikael.
You and I are running the magazine.
We have responsibilities towards our employees.
It is not just about you and me now.
I've contacted one of Lisbeth's
hacker buddies, Plague.
So we don't have to report it to the police?
If anyone can find the sender,
then it's him, but it takes time.
It will be faster than the police.
Are we talking about days? Or weeks?
Frankly, I do not know.
If we assume that Millennium has
something to publish...
...then what can they possibly have?
The worst-case scenario is that they
have a copy of Björck's investigation.
But they may not know anything
about our business.
Nevertheless, he has high credibility.
And the same goes for the magazine.
Maybe we could reduce the credibility somehow?
Anyway...
...we have to put an end to this,
once and for all.
She called us quarter past three in the morning.
She had locked herself up
in a room upstairs.
We were there 20 minutes later.
- Did you find any tracks?
The police took care of that.
We have installed alarms in the house now.
Erika told me about those e-mails.
They are probably linked with
what happened last night.
My contact is trying to track them down.
I do not want to involve the police.
You should do that now. It's about
physical threats towards you and Erika.
Towards me?
- Yes, even towards you.
The silent alarm in your apartment
went off last night.
We were there in 17 minutes.
When we searched the apartment...
...we found 180 grams of cocaine
hidden in one of your loudspeakers...
...and 120,000 Swedish crowns in cash
in your wardrobe.
What the hell?!
- They're trying to set you up.
Since they cannot hit the magazine.
Is it still there?
- Only the money.
The cocaine has been taken away.
I have to call Erika.
- I think she's asleep.
Erika.
- It's me.
I know what has happened.
It sucks!
I want to see you. Can I come?
- No, don't come here.
We will talk about it later.
I want to see you now.
- I have to sleep a few hours.
At three o'clock then?
At Samir's Gryta?
Will you come or not?
- At three o'clock. I will come.
Good. Bye.
- Bye.
I'll print those three pages.
Have you heard anything from Erika?
I talked to her. She felt bad last night
and wanted to sleep during the day.
How is she now?
- Better. Damn, I've got to go.
Has she got more e-mail?
We've really done a great job
with this edition, all of us.
Shall we have a beer later?
- No, I have a meeting at Samir.
There is uncertainty about
how many of these people...
...are connected to the Section's
activities.
After all, there may be more of them
we do not know of yet.
We have identified the key persons and they
will be arrested in a coordinated action.
More information about this later.
It is ten to three now. We'll break now
and meet here again in an hour.
Has something happened today?
- Clinton has been on dialysis.
The other ones were coming and going.
Jonas Sandberg is probably the only one
who has been social.
At 10.30 he met with two persons at a
pizzeria in Bredäng.
Whom did he meet?
- I do not know them.
They looked like Eastern European guys.
- Those are the Nikolic brothers.
Tomi and Miro Nikolic. From Serbia,
but they have been living in Huddinge.
Very unpleasant types.
Sharpshooters during the Civil War.
Miro is wanted for assault, but of course
they live in Serbia most of the time, so...
Mikael...
Hello, Samir.
Sorry I'm late.
How are you?
- What do you think?
Why didn't you call last night?
- What could you have done?
I called Milton Security
because I needed help.
We have to back off, Micke.
Samir's Gryta on Söder.
Connect me quickly, please.
I have stopped the magazine and
I have called the printing office.
This also affects Malin's and
Christer's safety.
Did you call the printing office?
- I don't want to take the responsibility.
It's too dangerous.
- Damn it...
Micke, there's a call for you.
- No, not now.
They say that it's very important.
Excuse me.
Get down!
They are shooting!
- Cut through the park.
What the hell!
Get down!
Police! Police!
Hands up!
Now!
Police! Hands up!
How are you?
Are you okay?
Here, wipe yourself off.
- How are you?
Get Blomkvist and Berger
out as fast as possible.
Out through the kitchen!
The two police officers were
eating at the restaurant...
...and recognized the brothers, one
of whom is wanted for assault.
Gunfire broke out when they attempted
to arrest them, but no one was injured.
The two brothers are now charged
with attempted murder.
Damn it!
Goddamned!
I talked to Christer and Malin.
They cannot stay at the office now.
- No...
We could have been killed today.
Both of us.
No job is worth dying for.
No.
We do not know if they just wanted
to kill you, Mikael, or Erika as well.
But the idea was that the police
would find drugs and money...
...and associate it with a
Yugoslav drug deal.
What about the others at the office?
- We're closing the office for a couple of days.
We will also postpone the publication
of the magazine.
Then I suggest personal protection
for you and Erika.
No, I don't want anyone following me.
We'll see how things develop now.
- Have you contacted with her?
What's going to happen?
I will insist firstly on psychiatric
care for Lisbeth Salander...
...and secondly a long prison sentence.
Shouldn't that be the other way round?
Yes, but in this case...
...the psychiatric report is
so explicit...
...that I have no alternative.
Thank you very much.
The trial of Lisbeth Salander starts
here in Stockholm's District Court...
...at 1 p.m., in about an hour.
It is expected to last three days, before a
large audience, as you can see.
During preliminary investigation
the police and the prosecutor...
...have given information to the media,
while the defence has refused to comment...
My God. Is it time?
I did not sleep a wink last night.
- Everything will be fine.
Of course...!
It will be OK.
Indeed!
- Thank you. See you later. Bye-bye.
A little more, a little more.
I can only regret...
...that Lisbeth Salander didn't say
a single word during the seven hearings.
However, that fact does not weaken any
of the charges.
Thank you.
Then I give the floor to the defence.
Thank you.
From the defence side we reject
all the charges.
We will prove that the prosecutor's
claims are incorrect...
...and that my client has been exposed
to serious legal violations.
I will demand that my client be
declared innocent...
...that her guardianship be abolished
and that she be released immediately.
Thank you.
Does the prosecutor have anything to add?
For several reasons I propose that this trial
be conducted behind closed doors.
The case is about the mental condition and
the welfare of a vulnerable person...
...and about material that is
classified as confidential...
...and in some areas may
impact on national security.
We'll talk tonight.
That looks good.
I will start with an effort to bring
some clarity...
...to your reasons for going to Gosseberga...
...to try to kill your father,
Alexander Zalachenko.
Should we interpret your silence as a statement
that you will not answer questions?
I will happily answer questions.
Then maybe you can answer the question.
I have not heard any question.
I asked if you went to Gosseberga
with the intention to kill your father.
No, you said you wanted to
try to shed light...
...on why I went to Gosseberga
in an attempt to kill my father.
That was a general statement
in which you anticipated my answer.
Answer the question.
- No.
"No" what?
- That's the answer to the question.
Did you strike your
father's head with an axe?
Yes.
He was seriously injured and I argue
that this is attempted murder.
What is your view?
Those were two allegations.
On which one should I have an opinion?
If striking your father in the head
with an axe was attempted murder.
That was not attempted murder.
It was self-defence.
Thank you.
Tell me if you need anything.
Can you get cigarettes?
- Forget it.
Thank you.
Hello.
- Hi.
How does it feel to be guarded?
- Well, not bad.
As long as they stay outside.
Erika...
I couldn't do it.
You are an egotist.
And an idiot.
I will stay at home this week.
And next week.
I want to be sure that I made
the right decision.
Well...
About us or about Millennium?
About both...
...I think.
I'll be in touch.
Take care of yourself.
Damn it.
Salander, it's time.
Lisbeth Salander's so-called
autobiography...
...lacks any credibility.
There are a number of allegations
against different people...
...each one more absurd than the other.
Everything is an expression...
of the paranoid schizophrenia
Lisbeth Salander is suffering from.
Can you give an example?
The most obvious is the portrayal of rape...
...of which - she alleges -...
...her guardian, advocate Bjurman,
would be guilty of.
The whole story, with all the details...
...is a classic example of
the grotesque fantasies...
...which children tend to exhibit.
But Lisbeth Salander is not a child anymore,
she is an adult woman.
It still remains to be decided...
...on what exact mental level she is now.
However, in principle you are right.
I understand.
In 1993 Lisbeth Salander underwent
forced admission at St. Stephen's hospital.
During the years she lived there,
you were responsible for her.
Is that correct?
- Yes.
How many days did she lie tied up?
In other words: clamped to the bed.
I cannot quite remember.
But not very many.
How many approximately?
Possibly... thirty times. But I don't
understand the relevance of this question.
Lisbeth Salander herself claims
it was 381 days.
That is pure fantasy.
It doesn't make any sense.
So you're telling me, she did not
lie tied up more than one year...
...of the two years she lived there?
- Of course not.
The defence has repeatedly tried
to get Lisbeth Salander's files...
...covering the years of her forced admission
at St. Stephen's, but without success.
Can you explain why?
- Because it's classified as confidential.
That is a general rule for this kind
of study.
You as a lawyer should know that.
Here I have a copy of Lisbeth Salander's
dossier, regarding two years:
Here it's clearly stated that Lisbeth
Salander was tied up for 381 days.
Advocate Giannini, what is the relevance
of that for this trial?
I want to prove that Peter Teleborian is
not telling the truth on this subject.
Advocate Giannini, records from
...to question Peter Teleborian's credibility.
I understand.
I felt like an idiot.
When the prosecutor submits Teleborian's
new report, I will have gained nothing.
She will end up in the mental hospital again
and I can't do a damn thing.
Welcome to your private young girls.
Who are you?
Plague.
What is this?
Peter Teleborian's private PC.
A USB copy.
I'm sorry. Come in.
What does it contain?
Everything you need.
Plus some nasty shit.
Annika, I have everything you'll need
right here. Cooperation with the Section...
...the psychiatric report in several versions,
fake dates...
...e-mail correspondence, everything.
Well, there you are. Excellent.
Here.
- I will never have time to read all this.
Read it during lunch.
The dates are important.
Good, great!
See you later. Bye-bye.
You ended up at St. Stephen's...
...after pouring petrol onto your father
and lighting it.
Yes.
- Why did you do that?
Because he had abused my mother
for several years.
On June 12 1993, he assaulted her
so brutally that she became disabled.
She had permanent brain damage.
- Did you tell anyone?
Yes, to the police officer
who interrogated me...
...to the Social Welfare Board, various
doctors, a priest and that pig over there.
When I came to St. Stephen's,
I tried to explain what had happened.
But he claimed that I fantasized.
As punishment I was tied up.
That's pure nonsense.
Again, an example of the fact...
...that your client lacks the ability
to separate fantasy from reality.
You lie, you fucking pig.
- Lisbeth, in court we use proper language.
I would like to proceed now
with the sexual abuse...
...to which advocate Nils Bjurman
exposed my client.
That is not part of the case.
Those are absurd allegations
without any shred of evidence.
It is an example of the abuse of legal power
to which Lisbeth has been exposed.
With respect to Frederick Clinton:
he might be on dialysis...
...in this case, at Karolinska Hospital.
Everyone here will receive all
necessary information.
I repeat.
Group 1 : Bublanski.
Group 2: Svensson.
Group 3: Modig.
Group 4: Figuerola.
Group 5: Holmberg.
In case of questions or ambiguities you can
contact your chief of division.
Good luck.
You have declared that advocate Nils Bjurman
has raped you? - Yes.
When did that supposedly happen?
- Not "supposedly".
It happened Tuesday, February 18, 2008...
...and Friday, March 7 of the same year.
It is clearly written in my biography.
Did you report the rape to the police?
- No.
Why not?
- The police had never listened to me.
Did you search medical help for your injuries?
No.
Did you talk to someone about it?
- No.
The late Nils Bjurman has
never been convicted of any crime.
He has never been reported to the police
nor has he been the subject of any investigation.
However, it's my task to remind you
that Salander...
...has been diagnosed as paranoid
schizophrenic.
She has spent several years in a
psychiatric clinic for children...
...and has been under guardianship
since her eighteenth birthday.
However regrettable that may be,
it has its reasons of course.
Lisbeth Salander has her
very own confused world-view...
...which appears very clearly
in her "autobiography".
Nowhere else has her lack of contact with
reality been demonstrated so clearly.
In this context...
...we will try to assess the credibility
of her words and statements.
Has the prosecutor finished?
- Yes.
Then the defence may present her evidence.
- Thank you.
Peter Teleborian claims that
Lisbeth Salander is lying...
about her allegations that she was sexually
abused by advocate Bjurman.
The prosecutor is of the same opinion.
I will now demonstrate that Lisbeth's
assertion is absolutely true.
When was this recording made?
On March 7, 2008.
I used a hidden camera.
If you are nice ...
If you...
If you are nice...
...Then I'll be nice.
Are you going to be nice?
Are you nice? Are you being nice?
It is too late now.
Stop the film!
That's enough!
Why did you film it?
- Nils Bjurman had raped me before.
He had forced me to give him oral sex.
He demanded more sex if I wanted my money.
It was the only way to obtain evidence
against him.
The only way to make him stop.
We'll take a break. A one hour break.
Sorry I am late.
- It's okay. Thank you.
Are you presenting new documents?
No, they are the same as the court already has,
however, with minor but crucial differences.
I will come to it later.
Then I give the floor to the defence.
- Thank you.
Well...
No one can deny any longer that
Lisbeth was the victim...
...of serious sexual abuse by her guardian,
advocate Nils Bjurman.
A person she thought that she could trust.
As I have said, it illustrates the
type of assaults against Lisbeth.
The attacks have been both
psychological and judicial.
The person who bears a major responsibility
for this, is Dr. Peter Teleborian.
In 1993 he has written a psychiatric report...
...together with Gunnar Björck...
...- who was a member of an illegal group inside
the Security Service -...
...in order to silence a dangerous witness...
...and thus Lisbeth Salander got locked up
in a secure psychiatric unit.
There must be a limit to these allegations...
Excuse me, but now I have the floor.
This happened after Lisbeth had poured petrol
on her father...
...Alexander Zalachenko, in a
desperate attempt to save her mother.
But those who protected Zalachenko...
...made sure to cover it up
and classified the investigations.
And with Peter Teleborian's help...
...they imprisoned Lisbeth at St. Stephen's
Hospital in Uppsala.
That's an outrageous accusation!
I have tried to help Lisbeth
Salander in every way. She attempted...
Yesterday Peter Teleborian presented
his new forensic psychiatric report.
Once again, he proposes..
...compulsory detention and imprisonment
of Lisbeth Salander.
But just like in 1993 this is
also a forgery.
That is completely...
I must ask you to allow the defence
to finish her speech!
Thank you.
His opinion is based on the "observation"
of my client.
That must have happened after she was
transferred to Kronoberg prison...
...on October 6, and completed on November 5.
Is that correct, Peter Teleborian?
I would like to call in two witnesses.
No!
Police! Drop your weapon!
Well... do you know this document?
Yes.
It is the psychiatric report on
Lisbeth Salander by Peter Teleborian.
There are three versions.
The first dated September 20,
the second October 1 ...
...and this one is the third,
dated October 6.
You gave me the documents.
And I have noticed that the first
report of October 1 ...
...is identical to the report which
Peter Teleborian presented yesterday.
Dated November 5.
Very odd, to put it mildly.
My conclusion is that Peter Teleborian
has written the reports...
...before he observed Lisbeth Salander.
For this reason it lacks all credibility.
Superintendent Edklinth, it is true...
...that you have received these reports
about Salander from Mikael Blomkvist?
Yes.
What are your overall conclusions?
- They are false.
They were written long before...
...Peter Teleborian had the opportunity
to meet Lisbeth Salander in prison.
Moreover, they were completed with the
collaboration of a certain Jonas Sandberg.
That's a lie.
Is it a lie?
- No, not at all.
The documents are dated
and there is e-mail correspondence...
...between Peter Teleborian and
Jonas Sandberg that proves it.
He is part of a clandestine group
within the Security Service...
...who have protected Alexander Zalachenko
since the late 70's.
The group was responsible for the decision...
...to lock up Lisbeth Salander at
St. Stephen's hospital in 1993.
Jonas Sandberg is one of a dozen people...
...who were arrested today by order
of the General Prosecutor.
Sandberg is suspected of involvement in
the murder of Gunnar Björck...
...and probably another murder.
We have evidence and several statutory declarations.
Would Peter Teleborian like to
comment on this?
Two policemen are waiting outside
the courtroom.
They want to take away Peter Teleborian
for interrogation.
Why?
He will be arrested on suspicion of serious
violation of the law on child pornography...
Specifically, for possession of 8,000
child pornography images and movies...
...found on his computer.
This computer is confiscated.
Please follow us.
Please sit.
The court has not been able to assess
all the information yet...
...but finds no reason to keep
Lisbeth Salander in custody.
Therefore, you are free
pending the verdict.
Are you sure that you don't want to
go with me to Millennium?
You can drop me here on Folkungagatan.
You know that you owe this
to Micke, right?
Yes. But...
Yes.
I must be able to get hold of you.
- You can reach me by e-mail.
Okay.
See you.
How did it go?
- Justice prevailed.
So now there is a party?
- Now there is a party.
What will you do now?
- Now it starts!
...suspected of murder, among other things.
The organization that carried out its activities
from this apartment in Stockholm...
...was responsible for serious legal assaults
against Lisbeth Salander.
However, the story started in the 60's.
The Section was founded then to
watch over the nation's interests.
Officially they never existed and
operated from this apartment.
Evidence suggests that even the head of the
National Police was not aware of the group.
In the mid-70's the Section recruited
a top Soviet spy...
Lisbeth has been released
pending the verdict.
So, she will either be acquitted or
receive a suspended sentence.
Here you are!
- What is this, "Estate inventory"?
It's the legacy of Zalachenko.
I don't want anything from that pig.
No, but you are of legal age now.
Therefore, I need your signature to prove
that you received it.
Securities with a value of 300,000...
...plus property in Gosseberga
valued at 1 ,5 million.
I don't want to have anything
to do with it.
Then there is this...
An abandoned brickyard somewhere
outside Norrtälje.
Only the plot has been valued
at 150,000.
Okay.
Sell all the shit and give
the money away.
I think you should read it.
I can sell it for you later.
Micke says hello to you.
Pizza Bussola? Here you are!
- Thank you. Bye.
What is this shit?
You deserve to die, you fucking freak.
Telephone information service.
- Yes, hello.
Please give me the number of the
Svavelsjö motorcycle club.
Who is there?
- Are you interested in Niedermann?
I'm listening.
Emergency.
Cop killer Ronald Niedermann is
at Skederyd's brickyard in Norrtälje.
A motorcycle gang is going to kill him.
They are heavily armed.
Am I interrupting you?
I was having a bath.
- Oh, I see...
Have you seen the news?
- No.
Ronald Niedermann is dead. A gang
from Svavelsjö has killed him.
Then the police came and arrested
the whole lot.
Thanks for everything.
Don't mention it.
Thanks yourself.
See you.
See you.
- Definitely.
