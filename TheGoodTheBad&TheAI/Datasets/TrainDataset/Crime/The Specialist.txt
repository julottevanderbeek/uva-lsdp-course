Nice view.
Perfect timing.
Wait a minute. He's not alone.
That's heartbreaking news.
Pull the plug. A kid's in the car.
The drug lord's in the car.
Kid took a bad ride, that's all.
Abort the action.
You're the rigger.
I'm the trigger. I decide.
You just sit back and watch the show.
Okay, sport?
Activate the fail-safe, you psycho!
Here's a tip, Ray. There is no fail-safe.
Come on! Come on!
He'll never make it.
You're an arrogant man, Raymond.
I taught you everything you know,
and you dare to turn on me.
Gonna kill me too, Colonel?
You're a specialist, Captain.
You deserve better.
Don't forget to write.
You like watching her die?
Taking them down?
Now I'm taking you down.
You're finished in the Agency.
You're goin' nowhere...
...you're as dead as those people...
...in the river.
We both are!
Have you decided to take thejob?
I saw your ad today.
-I know it's late--
-It's never too late.
After all, you're giving me a new life.
Really? When?
When you kill those three bastards.
I'm flattered.
You better get somebody else.
I like your voice.
You don't need an explosives contractor.
Yes, I do.
-You're my only hope.
-Go to court, use the law.
The law's been bought.
Use a bullet.
Bullets...
...are imprecise.
I heard you control your explosions...
that you shape your charges.
What I shape is my business.
All I'm saying...
...word is you are the best.
Whose word?
If we couldjust meet....
I don't meet or work in Miami
and I don't do jobs like this.
Why do you keep calling me back?
Why?
I like your voice.
Is it my cologne?
They're killers.
You'd be doing the world a favor.
I don't owe the world any favors.
Why did you wait so long?
I thought....
I thought maybe it would pass.
Every day is worse.
Remembering what happened.
That's what I do instead of being alive.
My father hid me in the closet.
I could still see.
My mother suffered.
They tortured her to get my father to talk.
We're going to have to kill her.
He walked by something
he shouldn't have seen.
They covered his face
with the pillow from my bed.
Waste them.
It was too small.
So they shot him.
I never thought...
...blood would be so sticky.
Sometimes I think I can never wash it off.
The only thing I understand
anymore is revenge.
I'm going in, and I'm going to do it myself.
You'll only get one of them.
That's why I need you.
I don't do this kind ofjob anymore.
I know you've been watching me,
trying to decide if...
...l'm on the level,
ifyou're going to take thejob.
I can't wait anymore, I'm going in.
-They'll make you.
-I have an alias.
Adrian Hastings.
Wish me luck.
Señor León.
How's it coming in?
Oh, boy. You don't give up.
It's packed in Monopoly boxes.
That's great, Papa.
You get it in. I'll put it on the street.
Come here.
-How are you?
-Nice party.
You went all out. It's fantastic.
-So let's talk numbers.
-Forget business tonight.
Go grab yourself a nice mulatta.
I want my money.
An advance.
Small token of my family's goodwill.
Token?
Token.
Listen to me, boy.
You know what the Dark Ages are?
The Dark Ages are what I brought
the León family out of.
I computerized your operation.
I streamlined your security.
I dragged you into the 20th century.
So don't fuck with me.
What is this?
A tip? I don't work for tips.
She works for tips.
I want my money. I want it now.
Go get it.
It's always a pleasure working with you.
Champagne, please.
Is there something you want?
What I want, I take.
Champagne?
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Welcome to our bank.
I've never seen you before.
I lived here when I was little.
A lot's happened since you left.
Like what?
Like me.
Insecurity is a terrible thing.
It would be.
I'd like to dance.
What's wrong with keeping
the conversation going?
Later. Right now, I'm taking what I want.
You look beautiful tonight!
I'll have my driver to pick you up
tomorrow and I'll show you my Miami.
Right on time.
Should I do it, Timer?
-Kind ofyoung to be riding the bus.
-Stop it!
What? I'm not good enough for you?
I wanna play.
Come on, baby....
-Stop! Leave me alone!
-Come on now, what's up, huh?
Here, you can take my seat.
Thank you!
That seat's taken.
Fuck you.
Excuse me?
Fuck you.
Hold these, please.
What's going on?
I hate knives.
Fuck you! You son of a bitch!
I believe there's a vacancy.
-What do you drink?
-Martini.
Martini on the rocks.
Gold tequila, straight up.
No one knows Miami like I do.
You like spending the day with me?
Yeah.
Do you?
Kiss me.
I hardly know you.
Wait 'til you try to spend the night.
Thanks.
Stay here. I must take care of something.
Got a light?
Is that the piece of shit?
Where were you?
Home.
Thanks.
What happened to you?
I didn't like the show.
You don't...
...walk away from me...
...ever.
You understand?
Sorry.
Get in the car.
Sure.
Every time...
...he touches me l....
I mean...
...he's the man who shot my father!
And he's...
...kissing me and....
Oh, God!
You don't have to do it.
It's the only way I can get
close enough to kill him!
You see, I have this dream:
I'm right there when it happens.
He looks at me like I'm a stranger.
And I say my name.
And it's the last thing he ever hears.
They don't suspect you?
I'm trusted, for the moment.
He's always with you. How do you live?
Alone.
That's not what I mean.
How do you live...
...with yourself?.
How do you?
Hey, you!
I'm talking to you.
You think you know me?
I asked you a question.
Do you think you know me?
'Cause the way you're looking at me,
we must be old friends.
Where did we meet?
Nowhere.
Nowhere.
You like the bitch?
Maybe you like me.
I don't like you.
Then don't stare so hard.
Somebody could...
...put something in your eye.
Fucking pervert.
Let's move it.
Good night.
Adrian.
Are you listening?
The first rule:
Don't go near them again.
Second rule:
Don't contact me.
I'll contact you.
Maybe I can help you.
-Let me see--
-No.
They're my problem now and I'm theirs.
Are you close enough to walk over?
Rule three:
If this is a setup...
...l...
...will kill you.
Now what?
That cop was a regular.
Juanita's moving in on me.
Get out of here!
I don't solve domestic problems!
Asshole!
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Lucky me.
Hey, Charlie!
J & B.
The word is, Manny...
...you're skimming.
Somebody's lying. I never took a dollar.
I hope it ain't you.
Because if you're trying
to screw Joe León....
You've known me, what, ten years?
I'm clean.
Good.
Very good.
Then you have nothing to worry about.
Let me see the books.
That is it. What?
-How about a drink?
-Sure.
September's missing.
See you, Manny.
What do you feel like doing?
What?
I'm working.
You have two hours!
Get another job, kid.
They got two bodies in there.
Something that used to be Charlie...
...and a hit on your brothel manager.
That was a bright move.
Something you ordered?
Didn't bother to tell me?
He was a thief.
-Tell me about the bomb.
-Very clean.
There was no damage
left or right of the blast.
The arming device was impacted
inside the C-4, so it was vaporized.
Brilliant plan, totally professional.
Must be a specialist.
-This guy is good.
-Yeah, okay.
He could put a bomb in your crab shell
and you wouldn't even know it.
I'll kill him!
You can't kill anyone
until we know who he is, can you?
I'll find him.
The important thing to find out
is who he works for.
Maybe he's with the CIA.
Maybe he works for the Mafia.
But we have to find out who.
Overview.
What does eliminating Charlie mean
in the overall picture?
-Nothing.
-Less than nothing.
So this target wasn't territorial.
It was personal.
How the fuck do you know so much?
He's guessing. Let me take a few boys,
I'll find this bastard.
Wait a minute. Give me a second.
I have to make a decision.
Little time to think here, huh?
You take over, OK?
I said, Trent will handle it, OK?
I don't hear you saying '"OK'"....
-What did you say?
-OK.
That's nice. Thank you.
Fuck you.
I'll need resources on this one, Joe.
Also, the place was crawling with cops.
I can't be tripping over civil servants
every move I make.
I need total control.
Yeah, OK, I will....
I will take care of that.
Personally.
Hello, Timer.
Having a good day?
Here you go. Knock yourself out.
I saw it on the news.
You got the first one.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, I'mjust doin' myjob.
You gotta stay away from the other two.
I could help you.
I could...
...set them up for you.
No, you stay clear.
Their future is about to become very dark.
You're still following me.
Aren't you?
It's gotten so I can feel you.
It's all part of the work.
Do you think about me?
I think about you.
My own personal ghost.
Or angel maybe.
-We could meet.
-You're a beautiful woman.
But, I don't meet.
-When this is over, I should leave.
-When are you gonna do it?
Soon.
Very soon.
Trent, you know the Chief of Police.
Trent is going to work with us
on this problem.
He was a former employee of the...
...CIA.
He is an explosives expert,
and I think he can be a big help.
I don't know.
This has become very public.
I'm sure you want a low profile.
Yeah, please.
It would be hard for Ned to go unnoticed.
I think there's more involved here
than keeping a low profile.
I'd say that I'm the one you can trust,
which is the main word here...trust.
To take him out clean.
Our bomb boys are the best.
I hope that's true.
They better be fucking magicians...
...because this man's impressive.
What are you, a fucking fan?
Come on! Stop that, this is serious, right?
Don't you two start!
We're here to find a way to protect
the business. Don't forget that.
Is that understood?
I must tell you...
...that this one is not negotiable.
I'll do what I can. Put him on as a fed.
Chief, always a pleasure.
Good to see you again.
OK, Danny, help me up.
Oh, boy. I hate that deep couch.
Now, listen. Danny, you'll do me a favor.
Do your best to make
this thing look official.
No, please. You do that,
and I promise you...
...l will not forget you.
A man's got to eat.
Idiota.
Where's the bomb squad?
Come on, boys and girls,
what are we doing? Look alive.
What've you got?
We're doing a complete background
check on everybody at the party.
Give me the next one.
Listen, I'll handle the biographies.
You trace the C-4. OK, Ace?
Chief says you're on this. Fine.
But I don't take orders
from any ex-anything.
OK, Ace?
I must tell you. I'm sorry,
I thought your chief said...
...the fullest cooperation
would be forthcoming.
I must tell you something.
This doesn't feel like full cooperation.
Look at this shit. What's this?
This is, uh....
Shouldn't this be in the lock-up?
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.
You guys are the experts.
Maybe you don't need me.
I mean, like what is this? This is....
This is Semtex.
Am I right? Plastique.
Plastic explosive.
Am I right? You're the expert.
This could blow up this whole area,
and if this area goes...
...the whole building could go up.
Am I right?
I don't know.
Maybe if I put this in here....
What else do we have here?
This is a plunger detonator, right?
And that's a little mini-receiver.
This looks like American circuitry to me.
Call me a patriot...
...but American craftsmanship
is the greatest.
Watch.
Here we go.
Let's see.
Perfect fit, first time...
...every time. Screw it on.
One little twist.
And, voilà.
A perfect receiver bomb.
Which of course is...
...absolutely worthless without a...
...transmitter.
Twenty seconds, and...
...we're hot.
Deactivate it, you sanctimonious prick!
Cut that shit!
OK, you made your point!
Have l?
-That's enough!
-What do you mean?
You think I give a shit
if the whole block goes up?
I don't!
You've had enough. Is that it?
Yes, enough is enough!
-I can't do it.
-Twelve.
What the hell, are you crazy?
I'm the craziest person
you'll ever meet in your life.
Six.
Five.
Four.
-Three.
-Please!
Now, here's a tip...
...you take care of the shit work.
And leave the fox at the party to me. OK?
We on the same page?
Ace?
Do you like it? Those go upstairs.
I like where I live.
I like you where I live.
Thanks.
Close the doors. Leave.
Better than you're used to?
Next time you order a hit you might
consider taking out your decorator.
You like to live dangerously?
A little danger never killed anyone.
Right, baby?
Sometimes.
You know...
...when I look at you...
...l see something I like very much.
Know what it is?
I'm breathless with anticipation.
I see me.
Let's get this over with.
Wait a minute.
You're the Mob's accountant, Bill.
Is that all you've got for me?
No. I have something else for you.
See you later.
Don't touch that! It could be a bomb!
Very funny.
Son of a bitch!
Kid!
Look at the way you parked
my fucking car.
Sir, I didn't park your car.
Sorry.
I'll get it for you.
Here's your tip.
Some ride that must have been.
Is this the decoy?
Who was this supposed to fool?
Any witnesses?
The kid?
Nice one, Ray.
Clever boy.
'"Bye-bye.'"
At least he hasn't lost his sense of humor.
Who gave you permission to smile?
Shut up.
Quite a step up for you, isn't it?
Depends on how you look at it.
-Tomas is on his way--
-Shut up!
Who are you?
I said, '"Who are you?'"
Who are you?
I'll tell you who you are.
You are nobody.
I created Adrian Hastings.
I got you inside.
You work for me.
Don't you ever fucking forget it.
You should have him
out in the open by now.
You get your three corpses,
I get Ray Quick.
That was the deal. What happened?
I can't keep him on the line
long enough to get a trace.
He doesn't want to take a meeting.
What should I do?
Wish him out of hiding?
You're in over your head.
Maybe you've outlived your usefulness.
Is that possible?
You need me.
I studied him, I drew him out.
With my voice, with my ads. He trusts me.
Why do I need you?
Why don't I just grab him
before he brings Tomas down?
Why do you even need...
...to live at all?
Maybe he's not interested in a big-mouth,
hotshot asshole like you.
You know what I love about you?
It's not just this...
...poetry.
It's your heart.
