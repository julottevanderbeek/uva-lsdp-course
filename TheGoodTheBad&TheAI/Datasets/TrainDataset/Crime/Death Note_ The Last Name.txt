Don't! Don't come!
Death, that's what you want, isn't it?
No! I don't want to die!
You're my assistant aren't you?
I'll die with you!
Let's go to heaven
where your mom and dad
are waiting for you
"Sakajo Ryotarou"
Amane Misa
Your life's been extended
Are you an ... angel?
No, I'm the Reaper
The Reaper£¿
Cool!
The human whose name is written in the note shall...
die.
Akino SHiori was shot and killed by a woman at the museum
Misora Naomi, the murderer, also killed herself there
Did they know each other?
I don't know
Yagami Light, the boy who saw it, was Shiori's boyfriend, wasn't he?
Were they involved in a love triangle?
That's enough! Where do you think you are!
Are you from their college? Can I ask you couple questions?
No, we're not!
Ah, you're detectives! Then I want to ask some...
Get out of here!
The Police...?
I feel sorry for both Shiori and Light
Who said that Misora was an excellent FBI agent?
She was too obsessed with catching the one who killed her fiance
I don't understand why she suspected Light
They're here
Yagami Light
the hero of this tragedy who lost his girlfriend
His father is the director of the detective team
And his sister... must still be in high school
I heard Kira has something to do with this case
Don't say such nonsense
Kira didn't kill her
Light must be hurt by such a heartless rumor
You're right..
Everyone feels sorry for you, Light
Dad, I will avenge Shiori
Sorry, I didn't want you involved
I'll definitely make Kira pay
You ARE the Kira, aren't you?
Opening!
Good evening
Welcome to Evening Spot, I'm Nishiyama Saeko
Nakayama Kiyohiko, who murdered a girl, just died of heart attack
Nakayama was wanted for murder
But today in Shibuya he suddenly fell
and died of heart attack
Today was the 10th birthday of Aoki Takuma, the victim's brother
My sister asked Kira-sama from heaven to do this
I think this was a gift from her
Currently, L, the mysterious detective ICPO invited to investigate
has concluded that Kira lives in Kanto, Japan, but has not achieved any further result
This is Kira's handy work
The police has not admitted though
You must leave everything communication device, including mobile phone here
Ryuzaki, here is Mr. Yagami Light
Ryuzaki£¿
I see, a false name to protect you from Kira
You're so sharp. How did you see it?
You can see it easily if you think of the cases logically
I've heard about your extraordinary ability
Not sure if they were being sarcastic..
I suspect you to be Kira
Are you joking?
I don't like to joke
Then why did you invite such a dangerous person?
Because if I die, you'll be suspected the most
You mean, if you die, I'm Kira
How did you came up with that?
Our investigation status has leaked out to Kira
so I had the FBI team investigate our members and their family
including you, Light
I felt like someone's been following me
As a result, we've lost
Every member of the team was killed. This is a shame
But we succeeded in profiling the most suspicious person
out of the people we have investigated
You mean me?
Yes, and we set cameras and taps in your room
That's illegal...!
Did my father agree too?
It was a special case
If so, it must've proved that I'm innocent
I bet you can outwit them easily
Besides, Misora Naomi reached you although we didn't give her any information
Hey, Wait!
You're too mean... Light just lost his grilfriend!
because Misora Naomi killed her!
Kira can control the dying situations
You think that I controlled Shiori and Misora and killed them...
What for£¿
To make people feel sorry for you and to join our team
to approach me and...
to kill me
You bastard!
You may have a superior intelligence, but you don't have a heart!
Mr. Matsuda, I can prove my innocence on my own
So, how do you thik I killed those people?
That's the only think I want to know
It will give the answer to every mystery
If all the mysteries were solved and it told that I'm Kira...
Unfortunately, death penalty
Checkmate
bravo
We don't suspect you Light
Ryuzaki too. He examined you just to know the probability
You need to suspect, when you're investigating
But the more important thing is to stop Kira from killing people as soon as possible
I also hope...
that you're not Kira
If you get the Reaper's eye, you can see his real name
by giving me half of your lifetime
You can kill him when you want!
The Diet has stopped the regular council by the speech from the PM
that crime rate is decreasing because of Kira
but many of the citizens and the young members of the Diet
rather seem to support his opinion
Killing is bad, but
a nation often kills criminals under the law
The matter is whether it is a "right killing" or not
from this point of view, Kira's killing seems to be justified
Who? Who made this idiot in charge of the government?
We must not allow this situation to happen, sir
Yagami, what are you thinking?
Where and what is your team doing?
Everything we do is based on L's directions
What kind of person is L?
Is he American?
I can't tell you, sir
You!
L is risking his own life
We believe his will and follow him
I understand
You can have request money or staff as much as you need, so...
catch Kira right away!
Nothing exciting at the Sakura TV festival
Isn't there any entertainment?
TV stars for example?
That'll cause a riot!
No, I don't think it's gonna happen
I beg you Mr. Demegawa! We might lose Saeko's life
You must leave it to me as I've been doing research on Kira
I understand him the most
You are kind of..
unattractive
Morning!
Not attractive?
-Saeko, this is our chance!
-I'm so excited
Are you sure it's ok to broadcast it without boss's permission?
Protect me even it gets you fired!
If we can get the ratings, they'll put hundreds of testimonials on the wall!
It's going to be the true Sakura TV festival
News isn't a comedy show!
Who do you think you are?
Your head and here should both be a little softer
Save the sexual harassment..
This is a case of kill or cure
What?
Director
We've got information that Sakurat TV
will broadcast a message from Kira
We received two videotapes from somone who called himself the Second Kira
The Second Kira?
In the first videotape
there was a notice that the murderer who was arrested recently would die
and yesterday, he did die of heart attack
Ms. Sagami, confirm it please
Yes
Also, the Second Kira
requested us to broadcast the other video from 2:59 pm today
We have not watched this video
As I said in the beginning
the Second Kira demanded us to broadcast the video
or he would kill all of our staff from the top
Please understand that we are hostages of Kira
As journalists, we risk our lives to broadcast this
Everyone should stay calm
Is this.. really happening here?
I don't want to goto Sakura TV festival anymore
It's now 2:59. Please watch this video
Here it is
I am the Second Kira
Just like Kira, I also hate evil
and I want to create an ideal world where there's no crime
Anyone who opposes Kira is my enemy
Anyone who disturbes Kira is letting brutal criminals go free
so they must die so the society can become peaceful
Hibima Kazuhiko, one of the opposers who's now appearing on Taiyo TV
Will die of heart attack
Kira's judgement is autocratic.
He is just a cruel murderer.
But..
What's wrong with Taiyo TV?
-Hurry!
He certainly is an autocrat
We might be slaves of Kira
Mr. Hibima?
Somebody.. Help
Someone please help
You alright¡­
Can you hear me
Still breathing?
Mr. Hibima unfairly insisted that Kira was evil and criticized him
He deserves death
Stop it!
You must accept Kira so we can create a future together
What are you doing?
Make them stop showing it now!
The producer of the program doesn't answer the phone
They just want the audience rating
Mr. Mogi arrived at the scene?
The furture is with Kira
If you agree with Kira's justice, gather in from of Sakura TV
Let's raise our voices for Kira
Only Kira can purify this unclean world
He's right!
Kira is doing the right thing!
Crime is decreasing thanks to Kira
That critic sure deserves it!
Today's the Kira festival!
I'm scared! Let's go!
Come one, let's see what'll happen.
I'm actually a Kira supporter
What?
Kira¡­
I won't let anyone interfer with what Kira's doing
Anyone does will die
Police!
Mr. Mogi
Stop!
Don't support Kira's justice
Do you defend the cruel mass murderer?
Don't forgive him!
Get away from here now!
What are you talking about? The police is totally useless
ya¡­
Kira is now protecting the world
No, Kira is a cruel murderer!
Wake up and disperse!
Kira taught us...
Disperse¡­
You are in danger too!
.... that the laws never help us
Do you hear the cries of the people?
People who lose their love can never be healed
Stop it
Mr. Mogi!
Mr. Mogi¡­
Mr. Mogi¡­
Mr. Mogi¡­
Do you hear the murderer's laugh?
Who took lives of innocent people, and live without being punished
You're in danger!
Get away from here!
Step aside!
Let me through
Disperse¡­
Get back
What are you doing?
You must stay away from here
Kira has begun to act
for a bright, ideal world
Camera no. 1, zoom in on the fallen policemen
Great! He's dead!
You'll be dead if you go there
We can't just sit here and watch TV!
This Kira might be able to kill just by seeing the faces
The the policemen near the scene to keep away
Yes
Ryuzaki...!
We must fight with Kira
But
We must rescue Sayu!
This Kira's targets
are people who interrupt the broadcasting
Sayu should be safe
And Kira, if you're watching TV,
Come here now
I promise I will help you
As you see, I have the eye
Let me see your Reaper, then I'll show you mine
Reaper£¿
Do you expect me to believe that such things really exist?
It must mean the ability of killing
And let's create a new world together!
What do you mean by the new world!
You murderer!
How can you kill people so easily?
What did they do to you£¿
Murderer!
Murderer!
Sayu...! Don't upset him!
Murderer
Murderer¡­
Murderer
Murderer!
What are you doing!
A car just crashed into the station
We don't know yet what exactly happened
Is that..
really?
Sayu!
Dad?
Cover your face with this
go inside
Mogi..
We'll inform you as soon as we find out what is happening at the entrance
Alright, cut to commercials
The ratings will be 30... no, 40 at least
L's message earned 35%
You can't go in
Step aside
Is that you?
You're the producer£¿
You can't enter without...
The police£¿Stop broadcasting now!
If we do that, we're gonna die
You want to see innocent people...
forced to get involved and killed?
I got it!
Calm down¡­
Got it..
Hello?
Thank you
Ryuzaki, I told them to stop broadcasting
I go the videotapes too
This is as I thought
It was Mr. yagami!
I can't do this in such as way
Dad, where is Sayu? Is she alright?
Light..
Yes, we're both fine
Mr. Yagami, are you still wearing a helmet?
No, I took it off
I'll go pick them up
Please arrange for the permission to enter the studio
You'll be Kira's target!
Dad and Sayu will not be harmed inside the studio
The Second Kira surely has the Reaper's eye
You've got a nice buddy huh?
No
There's no proof that he's not my enemy
Then isn't it dangerous to go?
If he truely supports me, he'll be a strong weapon to wipe out L
I must find him before L does
Move out
Sakura TV has stopped broadcasting, following the order from the police
Taiyo TV
is protesting against Sakura TV
According to Taiyo TV
Mr. Hibima died because of Sakura TV
Misa, the recording is cancelled
yeah, alright
It can't be helped
I need to change clothes
The Kira didn't show up
-Sayu
-Light
I was worried about you
Mr. Mogi..
He was killed¡­
Yes, I will report it
Excuse me
Kira...?
I found you
I knew he'd come to me
Yagami...
Tsuki?
The videotapes were dispatched
at a post office in Kita-ku Osaka
The fingerprints are so small
so 'he' might be 'she'
Are you sure that these are from the Second Kira?
It may be a fake
You mean, this might be a fake by Kira that there are more Kiras?
Light, what do you think?
That's impossible
And this Kira can kill only by seeing the faces
The video images were childish,
trying to use the media slyly
This Kira is way stupid and different from the first Kira
Besides, the first Kira doesn't kill innocent people
You're right
If I were Kira, I'd get angry
This Kira tried to make us believe that he was outside the studio
Had the studio on surveillance
He could be hidden inside the studio
Check everyone in the studio
If the first Kira joins the second Kira
It will be a huge threat
We must prevent it. Mr Yagami..
Is it possible to send Kira a message through TV?
What kind of message?
Nishiyama Saeko is the No. 1 anchorwoman in Japan
Thank you so much
That's clever... You're the man, Demegawa
How can they be so blind?
The Second Kira trusted and sent the tapes to us
because you've been reporting on the First Kira's activities
They should appreciate you
Irritating¡­
Why didn't you become an anchor?
See how Saeko behaves?
To be an anchor, you have to sell youself as a 'female'
I can't stand it
You're prettier than her
Give me a break
Demegawa!
Did you survive the torture by the police?
Yeah, and more than that
I got a sweet gift from them
What's that?
That's a message from the police to the Second Kira
We can expect high ratings
Great job!
This is a message for the Second Kira
Stop trying to approach the First Kira
It's not too late if you haven't met him
You must never get involved in Kira just because you're curious
You'll be used
and definitely killed by Kira
Yagami Light....
It's written "Moon"
but read "Light"
"...please provide us with any information regarding Kira"
"... save those living under Kira's terrorist acts"
"... and save the world"
Reating the message...
Here is the data for every staff at Sakura TV
and the list of people who entered the studio that day
What a huge amount
That total...
Let's start
Oh, good evening!
Nice to meet you, I'm Amane Misa
You're a friend of Sayu?
Oh, no
I was watching TV and... I thought you must be worried.
I couldn't help come to see you
to show you this notebook
Here, touch it
Light, you're back!
She's my friend.
She'll come to my room for a while
Hello
Light, did you invite a friend?
Nice to meet you
Her face looks familiar...
She's Misa-misa! of the Happy Sweets!
Yeah! Amane Misa!
How did you know it?
Ah, that's what I thought!
You haven't done 'the deal'
You know, you can see people's names and their lifespan
but you can't see the lifespan of a person who has the notebook
I couldn't answer unless you ask me
Are you... working in the studio or something?
um... I... I think I'm kind of famous..
A singer?
Oh, actually, this is my first CD.
I also appear on magazine and TV.
Oh, there's a new movie too
How did you find out where I live?
From the internet,
You gave a speech at the entrance ceremony of college
I found a photo of you there
If you were arrested,
Kira's secrets would come out!
I'm sorry!
But I haven't been arrested
and I won't be if I follow your orders from now on
Right?
I can find out L's name
I'll be your eyes. So...
So what?
Let me be your girlfriend
I can't
Why not?
There are your fingerprints on the tapes
If the police take fingerprints directly from you,
they'll find out you're the Second Kira.
Those weren't mine!
I'm not that stupid
I have a friend in Osaka who's into the occult
and I showed her fake pictures of ghosts
and asked her to send videos to TV stations together...
And what is she doing now?
If you want, I'll kill her right now
No, The police'll easily link her to you
If you don't believe me...
You can keep my Death Note
I'm still the owner of the notebook even if you keep it.
So I can still work my eyes for you.
Right Remu?
Yes, you're right
Now, I can't kill you
and you can kill me if you don't need me
I'm happy...
...even if you're just going to use me
Trust me
Why are you doing this?
Misa lost all of her family members 3 years ago
They were killed by a burglar
Since Misa had seen his face
The suspect was soon arrested
But Misa was the only witness so it wasn't enough to convict him
Tamura Yoichi, the suspect was soon released
She was caught in a deep empty darkness in her mind
Everyone gave up on Misa's future
But one day,
Something happened
"Tamura Yoichi Found Dead"
"Is This Kira?"
Kira punished him
Misa was grateful to the God named Kira
Please
Trust me
You are everything to me
But you killed innocent policemen
Don't you think it's the same as the burglar who killed your family?
Don't say such things to me?
You also think that..
...sacrifices for the good of all can't be helped
It was the only thing I could do
I really wanted to see you
I understand
For me...
You shortened your own life...
Your eyes became my weapon
Thank you...
I'll do my best
to be loved by you..
I'll arrange a chance for you to see L.
And you'll see L's real name
Can you do it?
You don't have to ask me, just say "do it"
I'll do anything you want me to
If one of us gets arrested
we'll never talk about the other one and the Death Note
Can you swear?
Yes, I swear
Good
Then... It's my turn
We're gonna date at least once a week
You don't understand what I said
But once L dies,
There won't be no difficulty between us, right?
You underestimate L
Besides L is already...
Suspecting that I am Kira
What?
L is so smart
Everybody says L hasn't figured out anything yet...
Now I've reached a position where I can contact him directly,
L and Kira are getting closer...?
I'm impressed by both!
It's so exciting
And of course, I need you to kill L.
So I wanted to contact you as quickly as possible
If so, why just can't we date?
If you want to date once a week
I'll have to date other girls
to avoid being suspected that we have a special relationship
You can't do that
If I see you dating other girl..
I'll kill her!
I'm the only one who'll date you!
If you don't obey me, I have to kill you
I won't let you kill her, Yagami Light!
If you harm this girl,
I won't forgive you
I see her lifespan
If she dies, I'll think it's because you killed her. I'll have to kill you
If I find you trying to kill her..
I'll kill you before that happens
Ryuzaki...?
Since that, there's no new action by the Second Kira
I'm afriad the FIrst and the Second Kira have made contact already
Isn't it careless to expose your face?
Yes, it's dangerous if you're Kira
You're the only one outside who knows that I'm L, so
If you told the Second Kira about me, it's "the end." To avoid it,
I brought this
That'll work
Did you come to watch over me?
You think Kira is a college student. don't you?
I have an important job here
About Kira?
Light
I had a recording nearby so I came to see you
Here I am
You
Oh?
Are you Light's friend?
Yeah
His name is Ryuzaki
Why're you wearing such as stupid mask?
Why don't you take it off?
Hi there!
Are you... Ryuzaki...?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Amane Misa
Um... Light?
Your friend is a little weird
He's just shy
I envy you Light
I listen to your Heaven's Door!
Really?
I'm so glad!
Light, why can you date with such a cute pop star?
I approached him first
Misa!
Look, isn't that Misa-Misa?
She really is!
Why! Why is she here?
This is great
It's real
You're the most intelligent students in Japan, right?
Please shake hands with me
Oh! Someone touched my bottom!
Can't forgive him!
I, the greatest detective, will definitely catch the pervert!
Here you go
Ryuzaki, you're funny
Then, don't you want to date with me?
Too bad, here's my only sweet heart
Whaaat?
I have a class, so go back to your work
Right
Sorry, but I'm glad to see you
See you soon, Light
It's good...
She's so cute
Ryuzaki
She's my girlfriend
bye
It was lucky to see Misa-Misa.
I'll go back to the office
Take care
I won...!
"Misa"
Hello
What are you doing?
Someone dropped this cell phone and I picked it up
It belongs to Misa
Give it to me
Calling her just after you said goodbye?
You really are in love with her
Or,
Was there anything you had to ask her immediately
Hello
We have the target.
It wasn't the place we expected
since she moved around so much
We'll send her to the office
I got it
Thank you for the hard work
Just now
We arrested Amane Misa for the suspicion to be the Second Kira
What?
She is an enthusiastic supporter of Kira and she was in the studio that day
From her room,
We found material evidences such as a cosmetic powder
and fibers matching her clothes
We're not going to announce so please cooperate for awhile
You have to stay away from the office
What are you going to do to her?
I can't tell you.
Can I take her phone too?
I can't believe she's the Kira
It can't be
Awwww, Light
The goddess of the luck is gone
See you
Ryuzaki
Do we really have to do this?
Second Kira can kill by seeing the face
It's reasonable to restrain her with a 24 hour surveillance
If she isn't Kira...
This will violate human rights
We've got the evidence!
Besides she stays silent even in this situation
If she's innocent, why doesn't she just say so
Tell her agent to announce
that she's in hospital
It's already done
Mr. Yagami
Amane and Light have a close relationship
What?
She's even visited your home, Mr. Yagami
Light...
I have to contact Rem
before Misa talks them about the secrets...
It's gonna get worse
We can't part from the owner of the Death Note
Unless the owner abandons the right of possession or...
dies
She hasn't eaten anything in 2 days
She has a lot of guts..
She doesn't even complain
I'm... becoming a fan of her
I'm going to buy her CD
Idiot!
Toilet...
I want to use the toilet
Even after she got caught,
Kira hasn't stopped punishing
Here
Misa
Please...
Say something...
We don't want to..
make you suffer anymore
What do you...
know about Kira?
I can't stand this anymore
kill me
kill me
We must release her!
Amane Misa, do you hear me?
Please
kill me
Do you mean that you admit you're the Second Kira?
It doesn't matter if I'm Kira or not
If I have to live like this...
I'd rather die
Hey!
kill me now
You're able to kill me easily!
I should have died that time anyway
I'm happy even if I die now
kill me before I get old and lose my beauty
kill me right now
Rem..
Misa abandoned the possessive right of the Death Note
She asked me to kill her
because she didn't want you to get in trouble
Do you understand, Yagami Light?
Everything she did was to be loved by you
Did she...
lose all the memory about the Death Note?
Of course
She forgot that she has killed people
or that you are Kira
I told her that she'd never see me anymore
and all she'd remember is that she loves Yagami Light
Misa answered it would be fine
Save her at all cost!
If you don't, I'll kill you
With a Death God being so nice to her..
Misa must be very happy
I am just trying to keep the promise with Jealous
Jealous£¿
Jealous was always looking down on Misa
He had a father-like sympathy towards the girl who lost her parents
However, when the time comes when Misa would die
Eventually, he broke the rules of the Death Gods
He wrote the name of the man
and extended Misa's lifespan
The Death Gods exist only to take lives of humans
It's a serious taboo to save a human
and extend her lifespan
Jealous fell to pieces and died
asking me to take care of her
Therefore
Jealous's Death Note was given to Misa
A Death God who falls in love with a human shall die...
a great story, indeed
If you won't save Misa,
I will kill you
Don't give me the same phrase over and over again, Rem
Imagine how she feels if I die
She'll definitely kill herself
Can't you even imagine that?
There's a way
It needs a lot of work though..
Are you really sure that it will save Misa
if only I follow your direction
Can't you trust me even a little?
He's smarter than you think
Ok, I trust you
Yagami Light
I leave Misa to you
What are you doing with my Death Note?
I'm just hiding it
When I discard its possession, I'll say...
"I discard it"
"I discard it"...
hum....
Hey stalker
If you quit now,
I won't accuse you!
I'll give you my autograph and a kiss!
Oh please!
Let me out of here!
What happened to her during the blackout
She kept repeating..
We are not stalkers.
We are the police
The police can't do such a thing!
Pop stars are wiser than you think!
If you think we are stalkers,
why did you keep silent?
I don't know!
You suddenly caught me
when I was just going to have lunch with Light
Do you admit the relationship between Yagmai Light?
Of course...
Of course I do. He's my boyfriend.
Is she really the same person?
Then how, did you and Light know each other?
I fell in love with him at first sight at Sakura TV station
I found his address and went to his home
Anything wrong?
You know how she acted before
Now she frankly admitted about Light
I'm confused
Who said that we can't bring cellphones into the office?
ya..
Hello
I got it, please come in
Keep recording and shut down the screen
Yes
Is someone coming?
Light!
I've told Ryuzaki but...
As L said, I might be the Kira
What on earth are you talking about?
I've been thinking that..
It may be better if people who committed serious crimes die
So it's possible that I may become Kira
You're not the only one who thinks so!
Are you trying to cover Misa?
I don't know much about her yet since we've just started dating
I can't believe that she's Kira
Of course, I'm not conscious of Kira in me
but,
I might have a multiple personality
I want you to figure it out
We investigated you, but couldn't find anything suspicious
But we watched over him only when he was home
We don't know exactly what he did outside
Then tie his arms and legs and keep him under surveillance
This time
It's an around-the-clock surveillance
That'll be fine with me
But if,
new crimes are committed while I'm under surveillance...
and Kira punishes the criminals
When it happens
We'll certainly free you
Thank you
Light...
Do you really mean it?
