Porter: G.S.W...
that's what
the hospitals call it--
gunshot wound.
The doctor has to report it
to the police.
That makes it hard
for guys in my line...
to get what l'd call
''quality health care.''
Porter: Not many men know
what their life's worth.
l do...70 grand.
That's what
they took from me...
and that's what
l was gonna get back.
Porter: They say
time heals all wounds...
and you'd think after
l would have given up any idea
of getting even.
Just be a nice guy,
call it a day.
Nice guys are fine.
Man: Rude motherfucker.
You gotta have someone
to take advantage of.
But they always finish last.
Man: Help a cripple.
Help a homeless.
Help a Vietnam vet
walk again.
Help a cripple.
Thank you, sir.
Help a Vietnam vet walk again.
Help a cripple. Thank you, sir.
What the fuck you doing?
Get the fuck--Ack!
Shut up.
l cured you.
Cocksucker!
What do l owe you?
Oh, 2.98.
Son of a--Hey!
Hey, my cigarettes!
Oh! Sorry, sorry.
Pardon me.
Thank you.
Have a nice day,
Mr. Johnson.
Excellent fit, sir.
And how will you be paying?
-
- Mister?
Huh?
l'll give you
Let me see that Magnum.
That's it.
Um, l'll need
to see some l.D.
Of course.
l'm sorry, Mr. Johnson.
This card's been canceled.
lmpossible.
Well, l tried it twice.
Do you have another
form of payment?
Try it again.
Ohh.
Porter: Old habits die hard,
l guess.
lf you don't kick 'em,
they kick you.
Ain't marriage grand?
Porter.
You're not dead.
What are you
gonna do, kill me?
Not now.
Yeah.
You're cleaning up.
Mm-mmm.
No.
Ohh.
Lynn: Val still wants
to talk to you.
Sorry, babe.
Shall l tell him
to call back again?
Nah, l'll talk to him.
Shut him up anyway.
Mmm.
Val.
Yep, same
as always. You?
Yeah, good, good.
Um, why?
Are you there now?
Well, don't sweat it, Val.
We all look alike to them.
Val:
Same crew. Chow's.
Twice a week,
Tuesday and Friday.
Always between
always
the same route.
Chinese money
laundering.
Porter: Hmm.
How much money in the case?
Anywhere between 350
and half a mil.
And how much
do you need, Val?
Ah, we split it
No, l mean how much do you
need to buy your way back?
lnto the syndicate.
How much?
You mean the outfit?
Whatever.
Jesus, you know
everything.
Hi, sweetie.
The beauty of the Chows is
they won't go to the cops.
They keep everything
in-house...
and they don't feel pain
the way we do.
You notice anything
about those guys, Val?
They looked nasty.
Probably all kung fu
motherfuckers.
Why? Did l miss
something?
They weren't wearing
their seat belts.
We'll hit 'em on Friday.
Hubba hubba hubba.
Looky here.
Val: How's
that vinyl taste?
Daddy brought home
the bacon, baby.
-
- Val!
What?!
The problem with kicking
the Chows' asses...
an hour later
you want to do it again.
Huh?
Huh?
Total.
Total?
That's what?
That's 70 grand?
That's not enough.
lt is for me. l'm taking
the next few months off.
Here's the bag, baby.
Yeah, well,
l'm up short.
Fucking slants!
Should've hit 'em
Tuesday. Fuck!
We got away clean...
and got something
to show for it.
Always be grateful
for what you get.
Rule number one, Val.
Yeah.
Yeah. Rule number one.
What?
Everything's cool.
lt's just not enough,
all right?
lt never is, Val.
Hey, baby,
just put the money...
in the car,
will you?
l can't fucking believe it.
We should--
You know what?
You know what, Porter?
This is funny.
This'll kill you.
lt's always 140.
Someone oughta
give me a PhD.
You--
Shit!
Jesus, Lynn, wait till
l'm out of the fucking way!
OK, everything's
cool, baby.
Oh! Oh!
Ha! You were great.
You were great.
Everything's cool.
Gimme the gun--OK.
OK, keep the gun.
That's it.
Everything's cool.
Just like we planned.
Come on.
Don't fall apart
on me now.
There we go.
Ohh.
Oh, l bet you got
a lot of questions...
rattling around
in your head.
Lynn did not understand.
l don't know, pally.
l guess wives get funny...
when it comes
to girlfriends, huh?
What?
l didn't get that.
You got it.
Come on, Ms. Porter,
l don't have all day!
ls, uh...
is Ms. Porter here?
Mrs. Porter.
Yeah, whatever.
Ooh!
Aah!
You motherfucker!
Get up, turn around.
Get up. Come on.
What have we
got here, huh?
How much in here, huh?
What's in here?
Helium. What the fuck
you think it is?
lt's heroin. Unh!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Fuck!
Val Resnick.
Where is he?
You want to know
where he is?
He's right here.
Look. Fuck you.
Wrong answer.
Aah! Shit!
You motherfucker!
Fuck!
Val Resnick.
l never heard
of him, man. Fuck.
Where'd you get
the envelope and the shit?
Aw, come on, man,
they're gonna fucking kill me.
They're gonna
kill me, man.
What do you think
l'm gonna do?
Worry about me.
Oh, come on. OK.
OK, OK, OK.
Stegman, man.
Arthur fucking Stegman.
OK?
Where is he?
S-South End Taxi.
F-F-Farragut Road, man.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
l'm looking
for Arthur Stegman.
He ain't here.
Something l can
help you with?
No, you can't.
Where is he?
l don't know.
He ain't here.
Take a guess.
What?
Take a guess
about where he is.
ls he at home?
Why don't you
go fuck yourself?
All right, here we go.
Hey, come on,
roll it!
Wait a minute.
That was mine!
Not yours, man.
l get one more shot.
There's somebody here
to see you.
l'm looking for Stegman.
Who the hell
are you?
l'm Porter.
Well, Porter...
that looks like
assault to me.
Porter looks like the kind
that likes to resist arrest.
- Hey!
- Whoa!
Fuck, no!
Not in here.
Jesus, guys,
he wants to talk.
Am l right?
Did l call it?
Are you Stegman?
Maybe.
What do you want?
Your boy didn't make
his delivery.
Jesus.
Whoa, Artie.
Listen, don't
worry about it.
Why don't we
talk outside?
Artie,
you're a dealer?
Just forget about it,
all right?
And don't touch
my money, either.
Come on. Let's--
This is heroin?
This is heroin.
Guys, just--Don't worry
about it, all right?
Just take it easy.
Let's talk. Come on.
What are you guys looking at?
Play your game.
And you're bleeding
all over my couch.
Come on.
Steggie's been
holding out on us.
Check it out.
Porter: Val Resnick.
What about him?
You're gonna tell me
where he is.
No. No.
Even if l knew...
the answer
would still be no.
Where'd you meet up
with my delivery boy?
At his drop.
ls he dead?
No, but she is.
O.D.ed on that crap
you been sending her.
So?
What do you care?
l'm her husband.
You're not gonna fucking
kill me, are you?
Not in front
of these kids.
Where is he?
l don't know.
That's the truth.
You see, this stuff gets
delivered to me, too.
Last night.
And l won't see anyone
again till next month.
Why all the trouble?
Well, he's afraid
of the girl.
You know, l mean,
of--of Mrs. Porter.
l mean, that's how
it looks to me.
Look, l don't know
nothing about this, OK?
l know Val
from the old days.
asks me to do him a favor.
l make an extra
grand a month...
so l figure,
what the hell, right?
Now you come around
threatening to kill me?
Believe me, that much
a buddy of Val's...
l am not.
He's in the city.
That's all l know.
l got a game going on.
How do you know that?
He said so.
- When?
- When he--Then.
When he came around.
Said he squared himself
with the syndicate...
said he was back
in the big time.
Back for good.
He was very excited.
Well, you tell him
that Porter is back, too...
and Porter wants his money.
Or l'll pay you a visit
when these kids are not around.
Well--
When would
l tell him this?!
Talk to me.
Clerk: There's a young lady
to see you, sir.
Her name is Pearl.
She's got 2 very bad habits.
Right now l'm only
interested in one of them.
Heh-heh. Send her up.
Apartment 718,
ma'am.
Go right on up.
Send her up.
What's the problem?
Hey, Val, it's Haskell.
Sorry to call you at home.
Don't be sorry, sweetie.
Just don't call.
l thought it
might be important.
l got a call from a cab guy
out in the south end.
What is it?
-
- lt's Stegman.
Shit.
Hold on a second.
Unh!
On your knees,
bitch.
l want satisfaction.
l'm on the phone,
Pearl.
Unh!
That's Mistress Pearl,
you piece of dogshit.
l'm on
the fucking phone!
Ooh!
Ahem.
Make it quick, huh?
Haskell: Anyhow,
this guy Stegman called.
Sounded all nervous.
Sounded like something
scared the shit out of him.
He said
he had to talk to you.
l said l'd see
what l could do, Val.
Yeah? Did he tell
you what it was about?
He said to tell you
Lynn was dead.
Said some guy came
around talking mean...
and wanted you.
That's all he said.
Thought you oughta know.
Yeah,
you did right.
l want to talk to
that son of a bitch.
Haskell:
Who, Stegman?
No, President Nixon.
Of course Stegman.
Tell him Varrick's
by the bridge.
Make it...Hmm...
make it
Can't you see
l'm working here?
Unh!
Can't you see
l'm working here?
Oh, yeah.
Put it on
my tab.
Porter:
l'm looking for a girl.
She goes by
the name of Rosie.
Here's a picture of her.
You know her?
She worked by telephone.
Wouldn't be freelance.
Probably connected
with the syndicate.
Outta my league.
l wouldn't know her.
Well...
maybe you know
somebody who would.
Why you looking for her?
l'm her brother.
l got cancer.
l want to see her
one last time.
You know how it is.
Yeah, you two look close.
Got a cigarette?
Your sister sounds expensive.
Try Michael, bartender
at the Regal Hotel.
That wasn't the name
l was looking for.
lt's the only one l got.
Steggie.
Hey, pal, you know,
l tried to call you...
but you must have changed
your number again.
l got nothing.
l never gave you
my original number.
What did this guy
look like?
Well, he had, like,
dark hair, blue eyes.
He was a real
Cro-Magnon-looking bastard.
lf Lynn's dead...
maybe he did us
a favor, huh?
l know what you mean...
except l'm out
like a grand a month.
Maybe we can work
something out.
Did you get a name?
Mmm. He said
his name was Porter.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He said he was there
for Porter?
No. He said he was Porter.
Yeah.
l'll tell you something.
l wouldn't want that guy
after me, either.
l know how you must feel.
What am l, a nobody?
No.
l've got friends.
All l have to do
is point.
l pick up a phone,
say his name...
and he's a dead man.
And this time
he stays dead!
Val, try to keep it down.
All right?
lt's OK.
What did he say
about me?
Nothing. He just said
you owed him money.
Not why?
Nothing else?
Nothing.
Why?
How much you owe him?
None of your
goddamn business.
l just got the feeling
he'd like to kill you...
that's all.
Oh, Christ.
Porter.
What?
What did you tell him?
Nothin'.
What could l tell him?
You tell him
about the money?
The heroin?
He had it with him.
l told him l delivered it.
You didn't tell him
nothin' else?
l don't know nothin' else.
Nah. You gave him
something.
A name, maybe.
Someone who knows
where to find me.
l swear, Val,
on my mother--
Hey, fuck your mother!
Hey, that's not nice.
Try to take it easy.
What the fuck
you looking at?
Take it easy.
Not again.
Huh?
What the fuck
you looking at?
No, Val, not again.
What the fuck
are you looking at?
Val, come on, don't.
Not again.
Manager: ls there
some trouble here?
No. We're just--
We're leaving.
You know what, Val?
This one's on me, OK?
You see me reaching
for my fucking wallet?
No.
Sorry.
He just got
a promotion...
so he's
a little tense.
Hey, pal, is there
a Michael here?
That's him
over yonder.
Michael.
l'm told you're
the man to see...
about expensive
horizontal refreshment.
l'm looking for a girl
named Rosie.
Prostitution is illegal...
and you're speaking Greek.
Usually these matters...
are conducted
with more discretion.
Aah!
Be discreet now.
What was her name again?
Rosie.
And who should l say
is looking for her?
Just call her.
- Rosie?
- Yeah.
Porter:
Give me the phone.
Here.
Take care of that.
Rosie.
Who the hell is this?
Porter.
Try again, honey.
Porter's dead.
l used to drive for you...
provide a safe
work environment.
Porter?
Yeah.
Porter: Why pour salt
on old wounds?
l didn't need to.
l guess l had
a soft spot for her.
Hi.
Come on. Come in.
You look pretty good
for a dead guy.
How'd you hear about it?
People who know
were talking.
Plus, l heard your wife
was back in town alone.
She's dead.
l'm sorry, Porter.
Why?
Jesus. Surly Porter.
You're the same
as ever, aren't you?
This doesn't
look like you.
Yeah, well,
people change.
Stay. lt's OK, baby.
lt's OK.
Come on, sweetheart.
lt's OK.
Meet the nastiest damn dog
who ever lived.
What's his name?
Porter.
He took your job
after you left.
He's just as tough...
but he won't leave me,
will you, baby?
l need a favor.
A favor?
Maybe you're not
the same as ever.
l'm looking
for a syndicate boy.
lt's the ''outfit,'' baby.
We don't say
''syndicate'' anymore.
You know what l mean.
Whatever the hell
you call it.
Don't get touchy, Porter.
What's his name?
Val Resnick.
Oh,
that son of a bitch.
You know him?
Yeah. l met up with him
once a few years ago.
He can't use
Star Service anymore...
because he beats up
all the girls...
and he almost killed one.
You?
Does it matter?
You quit looking
after me, remember?
Would you happen
to have a line...
on where
he might be?
l suppose
he's at the hotel.
Which one?
The outfit hotel.
They're all there.
You got an address?
We're friends, right?
l mean, we used to be.
But l'm an employee, too,
and l don't think the outfit...
would like me telling you
where the hotel was, would they?
No. What do you
think l'm gonna do?
How strong are you,
Porter?
Personally, l think
you are the strongest man...
l have ever met.
But l wonder
if it's enough.
For what?
lf l know you...
you want this Resnick guy
for something he won't like.
Yeah,
l'm gonna kill him.
That's something
he won't like.
What if something goes wrong,
and they grab you...
and they ask you where you
found out about the hotel?
Why are we even
talking about this?
You know l wouldn't
turn you in.
l wouldn't talk about
who told me what.
But what if they
ask you hard?
l'll--l'll tell them it was
a cab dispatcher named Stegman.
The Oakwood Arms,
Union and 17th.
Hi, Val.
Where's my money?
No, it's not there.
l took your gun.
lt's back here.
You look like a pro.
You keep
your mouth shut...
and you'll walk
out of here.
My 70 grand--
l want it.
l don't have it
right now.
Where is it?
l gave all 130,000
to the outfit.
l gave it all to them.
Well...
tell them you gave them money
that doesn't belong to you...
and get it back.
Now, Porter,
l can't do that.
l mean, you don't
know these guy--
You're gonna kill me whether
l get the money or not.
All right, l'll get it.
l'll get the money.
Just give me a few days,
all right?
What the fuck
are you doing?
Noon. Tomorrow.
Say it.
All right.
You know, this may
sound crazy, Porter...
but, uh, no hard
feelings, huh?
l did what l had to do.
You could appreciate that.
Yeah, l appreciate that,
you--
No, no, no. Don't.
Please. Allow me.
Jesus.
God.
God.
You bitch!
Let her work.
Me love you, baby.
Me love you long...time.
Wait up, hon. Wait.
Tomorrow.
Noon.
You and the money...
be at the corner
of 7th and Franklin...
at the pay phone.
OK.
OK.
Where'd you get this?
Hmm?
Some hooker had it
on her shelf.
l recognized you. l swiped it
in case l could use it.
Did you hurt her?
Huh?
The hooker--
did you hurt her?
What does that
have to do with anything?
l've got a few minutes.
So go boil an egg.
Uhh!
Philip tells me
you have a problem...
you need help with.
Yes, sir.
ls it your problem who
breached our security...
last night
at the Oakwood?
Yes, sir. Ahem.
Then he breaks
into my apartment--
There's
an old expression...
that has
served me well.
''Do not shit
where you eat.''
Or ''live.''
''Do not shit
where you live.''
Yeah,
l like that better.
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry, Mr. Carter.
There are 3 ways that
we can handle this.
to help yourself.
And 3--We can
have you replaced.
We have an investment
in you, Resnick...
of time, money,
and training...
so assisting you
would be, in a way...
protecting
our investment.
And that is always
good business policy.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.
Thank you, sir.
You won't regret it.
Now...
according to Philip...
a man has come to town
to kill you?
Yes.
And you say
that he's alone...
and that he's
a professional robber...
is that correct?
Yes, sir. He does
payroll jobs, banks...
you know, stuff like that.
Mm-hmm.
What's his name?
Porter.
Well, what's
his first name?
You know, l don't know it.
He never called himself
anything but Porter.
Mmm.
Where did you
get the $130,000?
That's why this man
has come to town, huh?
The $130,000
that you paid us back?
Yes, sir, but only
Well, we never asked you
where you got the money.
lt's none of
our business...
but now it appears it
has become our business.
Here's his file,
Mr. Carter.
Do you understand
your value...
to the organization,
Resnick?
You're a sadist.
You lack compunction.
That comes in handy.
But now you've
allowed an area...
of your personal life
to become a danger to us.
A man in our organization
needs to be tough...
and self-reliant.
Were you to handle
this problem on your own...
there would be no doubt...
that you're the kind
of man we want.
l want to. Ahem.
l want to handle it
myself, Mr. Carter.
Great.
Until the matter
is handled...
l want you to move out
of the Oakwood Arms.
Uh, ahem, but l don't
have a place, uh--
l don't want anymore
unpleasantness at the hotel.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me for saying so,
Mr. Carter...
but it might be easier
if Resnick just disappeared.
l thought about that...
but l'm not worried
about Resnick.
He wouldn't last 2 minutes
out on the street without us.
lt's that other mutt
l'm thinking about.
What's his name?
Porter.
Takes a lot of moxie to walk
right into the outfit...
and start whacking
our guys around.
Either that,
or he's shit nuts.
Frankly, l don't understand it
for $130,000.
That's even worse.
l don't want Mr. Bronson
hearing about this.
He'll think
l'm getting soft.
One of his principles
has always been...
''lf you don't understand it,
get rid of it.''
A stitch in time,
so to speak, so...
stitch this mutt up, Phil.
Any Polaroids
or trophies?
No, not this time.
-
- Yeah?
They cut me loose,
Pearl.
Just like l thought
they would.
Hold on one second.
Shut up!
l'm on
the fucking phone!
Yes?
Did your friends
make it to town?
Oh, yeah.
Last night, baby.
Good. Now,
did you tell them...
it was Porter
took their payroll?
l did.
And they want
retribution.
All right. All right,
here's what we do.
Ho-ho.
Pearl: Yeah,
that's Porter.
He's shit
for brains.
Oh, shit.
Shit!
Next time, Porter.
Looks like Porter's
made some new friends.
Easy, mister.
l'm OK. l don't want
to press charges.
Who were they,
huh, pal?
l don't know.
l don't know.
Oh, man.
Oh, it's you guys.
Our buddy Stegman
says you got a line...
on a load of cash
there, Porter.
to be exact.
Come on, man.
Get off of me.
All right, all right,
all right.
What do you
take us for, huh?
ldiots?
Nobody'd go through all
this shit for 70 grand.
We don't like trouble,
buddy.
You look like a whole bunch
of trouble to us.
We found a dead girl
full of heroin.
There were signs
of a struggle...
and the coroner's
not so sure it was an O.D.
We got a witness,
though.
A guy with only one
nostril. Remember him?
Uh-huh.
Hey, don't worry,
Porter.
We're gonna give you
immunity.
Room to operate,
''Get Out of Jail Free'' card.
All you got to do
is get the money.
Oh, we can't
help you, though.
lt'd be against the law.
You understand,
Porter?
lt's my money.
Wrong, Porter.
Huh?
lt's our money, Porter.
Me and my partner's money.
You be a good boy,
we'll give you a piece.
We'll be easy,
Porter.
You got it?
Yeah, he's got it.
You understand?
You take it easy, huh?
We'll be in touch.
Sure, thanks.
What a dope.
Fuck.
Porter: Crooked cops.
Did they come
any other way?
lf l had been just
a little dumber...
l could have joined
the force myself.
Jesus Christ, Porter...
you need to see
a doctor.
Yeah.
lt's gonna sting.
Just clean it up,
all right?
You hold it there.
Yeah, right.
l'll do it.
Tell me something,
Porter.
When did you decide
to leave?
Was it that night
we slept together?
No.
lt was the next day
when l had to drive you to work.
You could have
asked me to quit.
You could have asked me
to drive you somewhere else.
Hubba hubba hubba.
Thanks.
Does it fit?
Oh, yeah...
like it was made for me.
lt'll look great
in your casket.
You know what l think?
l think that, uh...
all those stories about
you being dead were true.
You're just too thick-headed
to admit it.
Porter.
God, l missed you.
l missed you.
Don't talk. Don't.
Oh, no, l...
l can't.
l got, uh...
stuff to do.
l got...
Ahem.
Porter.
Where is he?
Porter.
Where is he?
He's in the bedroom.
ls he hurt bad?
Hmm?
The doctor
should be here any minute.
No. That's bullshit.
Porter, here l come,
pally.
-
- Porter!
Hey!
Goddamn! Fuck!
-
- Goddamn!
Oh!
Whoa.
Get in there!
Ohh...
Ahh.
Where is he?
He's gone.
He's gone. He's gone.
Gone, huh?
l know you.
You're that whore
from the picture.
Yeah.
How do you know him?
He used to drive me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
l'm driving you now,
honey.
You know what you are?
Educate me.
OK.
An ugly pig
who beats up women...
on account
he can't get it up...
'cause he's too terrified
of his own fucking shadow!
ls that right?
Yep!
ls that right?
Then l guess you must be
the lucky girl.
Aah! Ohh.
Ho.
Hubba hubba hubba.
l knew l'd seen
that ass before.
Sweetie...
l am gonna fuck you
Ah.
Jesus.
You bastard.
Aah!
Oh.
Jesus!
Forgot my cigarettes.
Aah. Shit.
Hiya, Val.
This syndicate--
or outfit...
or whatever the hell
you call it--
it's got a head man,
right?
Who is it?
They'll kill me, Porter.
What do you think
l'm gonna do to you?
Worry about me.
Aah! Goddamn!
Names. Come on.
Fairfax and Carter.
Fairfax and Carter.
They run the whole city.
Fairfax and Carter.
Where do l find them?
Fairfax isn't in town
right now.
What about Carter?
Where is he?
ls he in town?
Porter, it won't
do you any good.
They're gonna--
Jesus! You mo--f...
Frederick Carter
lnvestments.
Ohh. Ahh.
Hey, thanks.
There they are.
All right.
All right!
l'll help you out.
You're fuckin' nuts...
going up against
the outfit for 70 grand...
but l'm gonna
help you out.
Yeah?
Here. Keep talking.
Thank--Mmm.
Thanks.
l...
l can get you
in there.
Place is tighter
than a drum.
How many guys in there?
But, uh, well...
it's tighter than hell.
They got only one guy
on the outside, though...
so l got a way
around that one.
You are crazy.
You are a crazy
son of a bitch.
That's why l love you.
Yep.
You got a light?
l, uh--What?
You got a light?
Uh...
no.
No.
Then what good are you?
Huh? Wait!
Check my pocket!
Rosie.
Rosie.
ls your name
on the lease here?
No.
The outfit.
The outfit pays
for everything.
l want you to gather
everything up you need...
say good-bye
to this place.
OK?
lt's OK, baby.
lt's OK, puppy.
He'll live.
How are you?
Yeah. l know, l know.
lt's not much...
but at least
you'll be safe.
Nobody knows l'm here.
Sit down. Relax.
What?
Nobody
has this number.
What?
Somebody does know
l'm here.
He's probably
fucking her.
Hmmph. He's taking
long enough.
Maybe the dog,
too.
You think so?
Give it
a minute.
OK, let's give him
another bell.
Shit.
He's behind us.
- Oh!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Porter: lt's not just anybody
that gets a hit put on them...
by a big firm
like the outfit.
l was moving up
in the world.
Maybe it was time
to pay them a visit.
Carter wouldn't be
expecting that.
And who knows...
l might even get
my money back.
Hicks:
Told you he'd show up.
Give me my goddamn
money, please.
Fuck.
Stegman: Give me
my money, too.
Hicks: Give me my
goddamn money, please.
Leary:
Sure that's him?
Stegman:
Yeah. That's him. Come on.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Hey, fellas.
What you up to,
buddy?
Well,
our money's in there...
if you're still interested.
Well, not in the dough,
but, uh...
the boat l'm gonna buy
with it.
Huh.
What's he doing here?
lt's a ride-along, Porter.
See, your piece of the pie
just got a little smaller.
But don't worry,
l'll leave you some crust.
What are you
waiting for, Porter?
Go get it.
Go get our money.
You guys do me a favor?
We're here to help,
buddy.
They're probably gonna
frisk me when l go in there...
so l wonder if you wouldn't
mind holding on to this.
Jesus.
You know,
just for a little while.
Sure, Porter.
Hey.
Nice balance.
Douche bag.
Hmmph.
Can l help you?
Yeah. l wanna see
Mr. Carter.
And who are you?
Tell him l'm the guy
that whacked Val Resnick.
l'm sorry, l don't--
Didn't copy. Repeat.
Right.
Mr. Carter
will see you.
Uh, turn around
so l can frisk you.
Bravo.
Sit down.
My compliments.
They were 2 of my best.
Didn't know how
they'd lull too easy.
There's something
you want from me.
Val Resnick gave you
$130,000.
Paid us.
lt was a debt.
$70,000 is mine.
l want it back.
l'm sorry.
Resnick told me...
but l seem to have
misplaced your name.
Porter.
Porter. Right.
l won't forget it again.
The outfit is not unreasonable,
Porter...
but no corporation
in the world...
would agree
to what you're asking.
What about Fairfax?
Will he give me my money?
Resnick told you
quite a bit, didn't he?
Fairfax will tell you
the same thing l have.
We're not authorized
to do things like this.
Who is?
Who makes the decisions?
A committee would make
a decision in this case.
No. One man.
You go high enough,
you come to one man. Who?
Yes.
Woman On lntercom:
Mr. Bronson...
l have Mr. Carter
on the line.
Put him through.
Woman:
Go ahead, sir.
Hey, Carter,
how's business?
You wanted
to see me, Dad?
Carter: Pretty good
up till now.
Hang on, Carter.
Look in that green box,
Johnny.
Oh...
Are you kidding me?
Ha-ha! ls it
the convertible?
You thought l forgot,
didn't you?
Whoo!
Have a happy birthday,
son.
Johnny: You kidding me?
This car...
and Nick's got us ringside...
at the championship fight
tonight.
Gonna be a good one, too.
My money's on Rankin.
No, l don't think so.
l think Hicks is favored.
That's got nothing
to do with it, son.
Well, l gotta get going.
Thanks.
Happy birthday.
Drive safe!
You got it, Dad!
Sorry, Carter.
What is it?
l have a problem.
There's a man in my office
with a gun...
who says that he's going
to kill me...
if we don't pay him back
$130,000...
that one of our lieutenants
stole from him.
Porter: 70,000.
lt's 70--
How much is this guy
Carter worth to you?
What do you mean?
Either l get my money,
or l'll kill Carter.
Are you threatening me?
l'm not threatening you,
l'm threatening Carter.
Bronson:
An audacious man.
Who are you?
Uh, heh...
my money--yes or no?
No.
Carter?
Oh.
Bronson: Carter?
Carter?!
What's going on there?
You just don't get it,
do you, you dumb fuck?
Bronson:
Carter, talk to me.
Carter!
Call Fairfax and tell him
l just croaked Carter.
And he's next.
And after that,
l'm coming to get you.
Are you out
of your fuckin' mind?
You just dug your own grave.
l don't see
any cash.
They write you a check?
They gave me
the run-around.
l have to go and see
another guy.
Last one, then we got
a dead woman, an assault...
and all kinds of stuff
to talk to you about.
That means more
paperwork, Porter...
and we don't
like paperwork.
Damn shame, Porter.
Don't let the bastards
get you down.
That's right, Porter.
Don't give up.
Hey, can l have
my piece back?
Oh, yeah.
Nice roscoe, Porter.
Heavy enough
to be a nutcracker.
We'll be in touch,
Rocky.
Keep up
the good work!
Porter: Nobody likes
a monkey on their back.
l had 3...
and they were cramping
my style.
l was gonna have
to lighten the load.
Porter.
Where have you been?
l've just been
taking care of business.
You know, evening up
the odds a little.
These guys aren't gonna
stop until they kill us...
are they?
No.
l'm sorry.
Sorry l got you
involved in this.
So why did you?
You're a clever guy.
You didn't need me.
So why did you?
Yeah, you're right.
When l came back...
l came back here
with nothing.
No life.
No hope.
You were the only
good thing in my life...
that hadn't been
taken from me.
l couldn't stay away.
l had to see you...
just to make sure
l wasn't in hell.
So why don't
we get out of here?
We can't.
Why?
Well, you said it.
They're not gonna stop
until they bury us.
So...
So we bury them first.
l should've quit.
l should've driven you
somewhere else.
Hey, look.
Hey, look.
Whoa.
That's me!
That's me!
Happy birthday, Johnny.
Johnny: What's next?
Friend: You're the man.
You're totally the man.
This is your night.
Woman:
Hey, Johnny.
l'm your birthday present.
Who is that?
You sons of bitches.
Yes!
We didn't do it.
We had nothing
to do with this.
Dude,
she's so hot.
Get her.
She's so fine.
Go! Go!
Can you believe
this guy?
Second Friend: Dad's really
hooking him up, isn't he?
Boy, you are cute,
aren't you?
You must have some pretty
wonderful friends, Johnny.
Wealthy, too,
'cause l'm not cheap.
Don't wait up, boys.
l promise he won't be home
before midnight.
See you, man!
Damn!
Mmm. That's a good boy.
OK.
Yeah, right there.
Relax.
Who's the professional
here, Johnny?
So go with it.
l promise
you won't regret it.
There, baby.
Hello.
Relax, kid.
No one will get hurt.
Get hurt?
What's he talking about?
Shh.
Good to have you
back in town...
Mr. Fairfax.
l wish l could say
l was glad to be back.
l was swimming
with the dolphins this morning.
Easy, would you?
lt's genuine alligator,
for God's sake!
What's the matter
with you?
Sorry,
Mr. Fairfax.
Hello,
Mr. Fairfax.
How's it going,
Charlie?
Porter and Fairfax.
l bet that'll be
a short conversation.
Well, between us and
our neighborhood cops...
l'd say we got him
pretty well covered, huh?
Walter, wake up.
Walter!
Wake up!
Keep those bags up,
boys.
Come on.
Who the hell are you?
l'm the reason
you're home early...
Mr. Fairfax.
You're Porter?
That's it. Keep them up,
boys, at shoulder level.
Drop them,
and l'll drill you.
Well, what'll
you have me do...
stand on my head?
No.
l want you
to do me a favor.
Call Mr. Bronson...
see what we can do about
getting my money back.
Well...
he let Carter die.
But that poor
buck-toothed bastard's...
probably better off dead
anyway.
He'd probably
let me die, too.
No, with Carter,
he thought l was bluffing.
Try him.
You might find him more
receptive than you think.
All right.
You two are fired.
Hello.
Well, it's like this...
l'm standing
in my living room...
and there's a man here
named Porter...
who says that
he expects you...
to pay him sooner
or later.
Yes, of course.
He wants to talk to you.
Put it
on the speaker.
This is Porter.
Bronson:
You got balls, Porter.
You're proving to be
a real pain in the ass...
a mosquito.
To get rid of you,
l'll swat you with 130 grand.
Ah.
lt's not 130--
Hey, what the hell
are you doing, man?
Bronson:
Fairfax? Fairfax.
Yes. Oh, it's all right.
He's just killing
my alligator bags...
and shooting holes
in my suits.
That's just mean.
That's mean, man.
You people
aren't listening.
lt's not 130 gr--
No, you listen.
l'll get you your money...
but you're never gonna
live to enjoy it.
You let me
worry about that.
Here's the deal.
l want you to deliver
the money yourself.
You're one hell
of an optimist.
What in the world
makes you think...
l'm gonna deliver
the money myself?
Well, if you don't...
you'll never see
little Johnny again.
Didn't come home from
the fight last night...
did he?
He's a good-looking kid...
but you indulge him
too much.
l told him so.
Bullshit.
You haven't got him.
You wouldn't be
that stupid.
My dad never bought me
a Ferrari.
l had to steal
my first one.
Nice inscription
on the key chain.
A little sappy.
Want me to read it?
You're dead, Porter.
Nobody fucks
with my family.
You hear me?
Bronson:
You're a dead man.
That's Johnny,
Mr. Bronson...
unless you turn up
with the money.
ls that a yes?
Hmm?
What's the matter,
cat got your crotch?
Some decisions are hard,
Mr. Bronson.
Where?
l'll let you know.
l'll be in touch.
You just signed
your own death warrant...
for $130,000.
l don't--
l don't get that.
What is it?
The principle
or something, huh?
Stop it.
l'm getting misty.
And tell him it's 70,
will you?
What do you mean
it's only 70?
Only 70,000?
Hell, my suits are worth
more than that!
Aw, man.
Listen to this:
''Ocean Ray Sundancer.
lcemaker.
Camper canvas.
Vacuum flush head.''
l'm telling you,
you ain't gonna have it.
You wanna bet?
No, l don't wanna bet.
l'm out 150 already.
my damn boat.
Better come down
with something.
Hey, hey.
Hicks, Leary.
We're Holland
and Vanowen.
lnternal Affairs.
You boys wanna back off?
We're on a stakeout here.
Wanna step out
of the car, please?
What for?
l think you better
step out of the car.
What the hell's
going on?
l don't know.
ls this your badge,
Detective?
The one
you reported missing?
Yeah.
Where'd you find it?
Where exactly
did you lose it?
Does this belong
to you?
lt's Porter.
Follow him.
l got that motherfucker.
Hey.
Get in, Porter.
Stegman:
Close the door.
Now set the roscoe
on the floor.
Slow!
See, l'm gonna turn you in
to the outfit for a reward.
And maybe
they'll be so impressed...
that they'll ask me
to join...
and l'll be on easy street.
Medical, dental.
l'm just--l'm gonna
walk you right in.
Porter on the hoof.
Unless you get
rambunctious.
Then l'll just have to
take care of you mysel--
You're not gonna
fuckin' kill me, are you?
Let him go.
Now.
Hubba hubba hubba.
Aah!
Oh.
Ay, uh...
Huh?
Hey! Who are you?
What are you doing?
Hey, fatboy!
Yeah,
l'm talking to you.
Fat.
Mmm.
Ohh.
Aw, stop it, stop it.
l hate this. l hate it.
Look at this
stinking place.
My--Porter,
what's the matter with you?
Just tell us where he is...
so we can get the hell
out of here, huh?
Come on.
Too late now.
He doesn't wanna
say anything.
He just wants to
get himself beat up...
that's all.
Here it is.
That's as close...
as you're ever
gonna get to it...
but l'll make you
a deal.
Tell me where John is...
and l'll finish you quick.
l promise
you won't have to find out...
what your left ball
tastes like.
But if there's even
a bruise on him...
l'll make this last
l'll give you
a blood transfusion...
to keep you alive
if l have to.
Where is he?
l'm waiting.
This little piggy
went to the market.
Aah! Shit!
l'm listening.
This little piggy
stayed home.
lt's starting to look
like roast beef.
Then it's your knees,
Porter.
You can guess
where we go from there.
Where is he?
OK.
Hmm?
OK.
Apartment 11.
You'll understand...
if l don't
entirely trust you.
Put him
in the trunk.
We'll take him along.
Man: Let's go,
tough guy.
Fairfax: You two,
watch the front.
Aah!
Fuck.
Come on, Porter.
Hey, do me a favor.
Give me your lighter
for a second.
Come on.
Bronson:
What the hell's going on?
You were right
not to trust me.
Help...me.
Get out.
Come on, Porter.
lt's been fun.
See you later, kid.
Hey! Come back here!
You bitch!
Come on, Porter.
Let's go.
What took you
so long?
Oh, hi, Rosie.
Come on.
Come on,
Porter.
Ahh.
Come on.
Get in there.
Good boy.
Good.
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?
l got hammered.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
You got it.
Piece of cake.
Where to?
Just drive, baby.
Porter: We were going
for breakfast...
in Canada.
We made a deal.
lf she'd stop hooking...
l'd stop shooting people.
Maybe we were aiming high.
