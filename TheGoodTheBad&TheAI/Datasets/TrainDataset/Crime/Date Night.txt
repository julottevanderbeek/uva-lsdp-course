- No, no ...
Let me explain.
My husband, very sweetly, but ...
delusionaly thought that we could make it here

and we didn't, we were late.
so, they were very rude to us.
they were so rude.
- and we heard them calling for the reservation of Tripplehorn ...
and we just "us!".
We just took it.
So you just took somebody elses
reservation?
for the record, I was against it.

When didn't know it at that time.
We thought they were just guys from the restaurant.
So we followed into the alley ...
and suddenly they just grab all our stuff.
That's why we don't have our ID on us.
then,yeah, that was scary. what?
Then they start waves gun around
then the talking about a flash drive.

- Because i just remembered that we are supposed
to meet our friend.
who are a gay couple,
the one we met on the night boating.
oh, my God! The Bald and The Crazy.
Gay couple, shit.
We forgot our gay couple dinner.
Can I say something?
Joe Miletto is not a nice man ...
So, if you some out blinking on his radar,
we need to talk about how we can help you...
No, you do not understand.
We took somebody reservation ...
So we need to undo what we've done.

This guy owns cops.
We can't trust any cops.
- What we gonna do?
We can't go home, we can't
go to the police.
Miletto, he wants the Tripplehorn, why?
Because they have the Flash Drive.
okay, what if they gave the flash drive back?
- Why would they do that?
Because we gonna find them
and we make them do it.
If they have the Flash Drive
this is over.
okay, I like that, i'm completely with you.
I just want to ask you one question.
do not judge me. What is a Flash Drive?
- Seriously?
Phil, I can't.
- okay, it's a little device that we stick on the side of a laptop.
oh, it's a computer sticky thing?
in my office, we call it computer sticky thing.
okay, we need to get the computer sticky thing
to save our lives.
How? We don't know anything about the Tripplehorn.
- That's sound entirely true.
We know where they gonna have dinner tonight.
Come on.

when you took one look at him, you light up
like a sparkly sparkle.
-okay, that is not true.
is it true. And i get it.
because I light up too.
He is super hot. And why do you need
muscles on your shoulders ?
like that.
And I'm just the husband.
i'm just a dork who doesn't know
how to load the dishwasher.
I'm the guy who need to workout more.
who lights up for the husband?
- oh my god. you are right. I keep forgetting to light up for you.
well, that's ...
- Why do i keep forgetting to do that?
oh wait, I remember.
It's because every day i get up ...
make breakfast, go to work,
come home, clean the house...
pick up the kids, take them to
soccer, bring them back from soccer, cook dinner ...
clean them that dirt, give them the bath,
get them into their pyjamas which is ...
they fight every night,
it is a big surprise to everbody ...
every night they have to wear pyjamas,
and then after I have wash everybody elses ...
food and boggers after meal
I use whatever energy I have left ...
to physically put myself into our bed,
instead of lighting up for you.
yeah, let's pull over.
This is a great time to ...
Yes, we have to pull over.
I know you work hard, honey.
But you know what make all that hard work
ten times easier?
me.
If you just trust me to handle
things once in a while. But no, you don't.
You have to do it all yourself, your way.
you got me screw enough,
before I even got a chance to come true to you,.
but, If you just let me do something for you,
I think ...
that, I will surpurised you.
i really do
I know what's surpurising.
You think, I don't hear myself,
you think i like a total bitch?
you know, Brad and Hailey are split now.
- I know.
did you ever think about
leaving me?
No.
really, you never fantasized about
leaving me for another man?
never, no, god. If anything, i fantasized sometimes about
being alone.
What's that mean?
- just, there a times ...
when I just thought about,
of my worst day ...
just, leaving our house, just going someplace
like check in to a hotel ...
and just being in a quiet room by myself
just sitting in a quite air conditioning room ...
sitting down, eating my lunch with no one
touching me ...
drinking a diet sprite.
by myself.
- Thats sound awful.
look, I just wanna have one day that doesn't
depends on how everybody elses day goes .
It's not that i have gross sex fantasy or something.
That I would understand.
that make sense to me
mean, everybody have gross sex fantasies.
i mean, obviously, yours with Holbrooke.
Mine with Cyndi Lauper.
Really? but present.
- Any time of day.
What an interesting choice.
Brad said to me that, he and Haley were fine
And they were just really excellent roommates.
it's not we are, isn't it?
- No.
Right?
We should be going.
alright, I park here.
They are not home.
We'll wait.
-for how long, Phil?
The cops from the Holbrooke
could be headed over here right now.

maybe we can find their Flash Drive.
Come here.
We can do this.
- one night I dressed up.
here we go. Ready?
One, two, three, go!

pictures and information about one client.
DA, Crenshaw.
- The guy with the broom?
The Tripplehorn, they may have
stolen the Flash Drive from Miletto  ...
they were blackmailing the DA.

drive.
He is the ex-military
that we have questioned tonight ...
Holbrooke Grant.
What's the hell going on up here?

if you just give a minute.
No, i can't give you a minute.
This is my roof, toptouch.

We won't say a word about the pictures.

All this time, I've been keeping the cops of your ass...
and your stashing dirty picture of me?
- Very dirty, gross pictures.
You'll be in jail for what you done for me
So watch your tone, Mr. DA.
looks like you guys have something to resolve
So, my wife and I will be going.
no. no one is moving, so it will be a lot of
easier if someone in here.
Phil, turn the gun like we see in "The Kill Shot".
Put the gun down!
- Come on, cops.
It's gonna be okay.
- no, this is not okay. this is a bad plan.
shoot.

Just count it down.
- No, that doesn't work with grown ups.
thats doesn't work with people with gun
Trust me.

my kids gonna had me in 90 minutes
so this shit ends now ...
I'm gonna count into three and everyone of you boys
is gonna put down your guns.
Does she serious?

- I think she serious.
Two.
- it's just kidding, right?
Three.
This is the NYPD, put down your weapons
put your hands in the air.
put down your weapons
and hands in the air.
I'm a cop.
- No, not anymore, you're not
I told you I could surprise you.
good to see you again, Detective.
You too Mr. Foster.
- This was part of the plan?
The helicopter and the SWAT team
are all part of the plan?
he had your friend, Holbrooke called me, said to
be here 5.30 ...
you have something for me?
- Yes, i do.
I think there is enough evidence
of this wire to put those two away for quite some time.
Thank you.
Mr. Miletto, Mr. DA ...
you two are under arrest,
for obstruction of justice ...
extortion, conspiracy and I'm pretty
sure prostitution.
get them out of here.
so, you two need a ride?
Yes please, our kids must
be freaking out.
No, we've sent SWAT out there,
they are fast asleep with the sitter.
Thank God.
What is your story?
Just a boring married couple from
New Jersey.
So how about that ride.
actually, i promised my wife
to have dinner in the city.
I'm not sure but I think this
the best pancake I've ever had in mylife.
How did even begin to come up with the whole plan?
It's like that book
from the book club ...
Nasrin makes her brother and
stepfather to fighting each other ...
so she can flee the town through out
the desert ...
and menstruate in peace.
What?
- You read it? you read the book?
Of course. I read all of them
Why?
- Because it's matter to you.
I only read the first 30 pages
and the last page.
Who has time to read. I don't
like those book.
What? do i have something?
-no
I'll do it again, you know.
what, tonight, no,
it was very dangerous.
no, not tonight.us.
You and me, the kids, all of them.
I'll do it again.
I choose you, every time.
