Edward roel ?
eduardo roel.
My name's wilson.
Wilson ?
You wrote me about my daughter.
Oh, uh, yeah. Come in.
Who done it then ? Huh ?
Snuffed her. What are
you talkin' about ?
I sent you the newspaper clipping,
okay ?  I told you everything I know.
I never said anything
about anybody being snuffed.
Look, there was an investigation, okay ?
The car was
totaled. Jenny was--
Her neck was broken, they said,
On impact.
So she wouldn't have felt
the effects of the fire.
Those streets
up them hills--
Man, you got to be careful. You
got to keep your eyes on the ball.
Your mind's a little agitated.
You're driving a little too fast.
Those curves don't kid around.
It could have happened to anybody.
I didn't know jenny to be reckless.
But she'd have a drink
here and smoke a little pot.
That was it. Nothing more than that.
It was a point of pride.
Where'd she get it,
this grass or whatever ?
Oh, no, no, no. I am no drug
dealer. What do you think ?
I think you didn't get that ink in
the navy doing your national service.
Hey, man, I already told you, man.
Corcoran. You know what that is ?
State prison !
I did my time, okay ? My sister's old
man ? He's in chino doin' eight years.
I go to work. I put my life together.
I put all that shit behind me.
Five years in the joint ! That's it !
I just got out meself, didn't I ?
Terry--  what's it
? Terry valentine.
What's he got to say for himself ?
I don't know. What's he
gonna say ? They had a fight ?
She drove away. She was upset.
a couple of
weeks before jenny died,
She asked me to drive her downtown.
She said she wanted to talk
to her boyfriend, valentine.
I think she was looking for him.
Exactly. That's what I thought.
But we didn't go to no
hotel or nothin' like that.
some bad place, bad people.
Some guy unloading trucks.
Some kind of deal going down.
Now, look, I don't know,
and I don't care, okay ?
They could have been shipping
fava beans to eskimos.
Did jenny know ? Valentine wasn't there.
So if he was involved, and she
was into something, who's to say ?
But I want to tell you,
Jenny stood right in
front of those guys,
Eyeballing them, checking them out.
She made me feel like
she was covering my ass.
I can't
even believe that.
Really ?  What'd she say ?
hang on.
Can I help you ?
Can't be too careful nowadays, you
know ? A lot of tea leaves about.
You know what I mean ? Excuse me ?
Tea leaves, thieves. Terry
valentine ? Do you know him ?
And who are you ?
Wilson.  My name's wilson.
Well, wilson, to start,
I never heard of you.
Well, I'm not that well known,
Except around certain
districts, some police nicks.
Police what ? Who, me ?
No, couldn't be bothered.
Who the fuck are you ? And
how did you get in here ?
A little bird told me that you and
terry valentine have business dealings.
I don't know anybody named
terry valentine. Don't you ?
Now, you take a walk, pal, okay ?
You're makin' a big mistake.
Go on. Get the hell outta here.
What you been up to, pal ?
What you been doing, son ?
You got to buck your ideas up.
Ouch !
What you been doing ?
Jennifer wilson. Jennifer
wilson. That name mean anything ?
What's the deal ?
Whoa !  Hold on !  Hold on !
What the hell-- who is this guy ?
Only reason you're not dead is I
wanna find out who the fuck you are.
Jennifer wilson was my daughter.
Who the fuck is jennifer--
Wasn't she that chick
that showed up down here ?
Yeah, talked the same way
as this cocksucker. Yeah.
Yeah.  Terry valentine's
a friend of mine.
He's a personal friend. I don't
talk about my friends with strangers.
But that cunt daughter of yours ?
She come up here stickin'
her tits in my face.
Who am I ? How do I know terry ?
What's the nature of
our business together ?
I admire terry for a lot of things,
But I gotta say he let himself get, uh,
Royally pussy-whipped
by that fuckin' bitch.
You know what I would
liked to have done to her ?
You know what I would
liked to have done ?
I bet she would have liked that, huh ?
It's too bad she had to take
a nosedive off that cliff.
Probably dried her all up.
no !
I got a gun right here ! No !
-
- get him outta here.
You want me to call an
ambulance ?   no !
I'll call avery.
Oh, man ! Get outta here !
Whoa !
You come back down here
again, pop, and we'll kill you.
You understand ? This
is private property.
We will shoot you,
fuck-o ! Do ya get it ?
Fuckin' old fart come down
here. Big, dangerous gun.
Yeah, we're quakin'. We're quakin'.
Hey, you come on back. You come
on back and trespass, okay ?
We look forward to it, asshole.
Stupid english fuck !
hey, what--
hey !  Hey !
What the--
You tell him-- you
tell him I'm coming !
Tell him I'm fucking coming !
tell 'em I'm coming ?
¶ if you could only see me ¶
¶ I know exactly where I am ¶

I remember telling your parents,
"if you're looking for a name,
You can't go wrong
with a constellation."
Well, it could be worse.
They could have called you...
God, you're beautiful.
Is there anything in this
world that you want or need ?
Well, I wanna know why you need
that scary man in your house.
Gordon ? He's been with me for years.
He's not as tough as he looks.
Then what good is he
? Heard of loyalty ?
Yeah.  I'm loyal to
things that make me happy.
Oh, am I a "thing" ? Well,
you're certainly not a person.
You're not specific enough to be a
person. You're more like, um, a vibe.
god, I'm glad we're
having this little chat.  Come here.
Get out of the pool.
look, I don't
know what transpired exactly.
What ? Our friends downtown.
Someone took them out.
Took them out ? What
the fuck does that mean ?
It used to mean it was similar to a
gangland slaying. Well, maybe it still is.
Well--
well, who ?
Well--
blacks ?
Blacks ?  No, terry,
it's not their style.
From what I gather,
it was a lone gunman.
Lone gunman ? Oh, jesus,
you sound like the 5:00 news.
Why are you telling me all this shit ?
I didn't want you to hear
about it and then freak out.
Fuck you, jim. I don't
freak out anymore. Oh.
Well, it's probably nothing.
That's usually what senseless
mayhem comes down to, isn't it ?
Bad loan, bad judgment, bad faith.
These were bad people
involved with worse people.
Cops got a lot of
leads to follow, so--
As long as nobody can
connect anything to me.
No one's gonna connect anything to you.
That was a one-off deal. Like a moving
freight train, you hopped on, you hopped off.
Anything else, I would
have had you walk away.
You never saw those guys again, right ?
Are you crazy ? They're
your friends, not mine.
What ?
Your clients.
I befriended them when you needed
them. Let's put it that way.
Well, the cops.
I mean, you know--
Are they satisfied with
this gangland shit or what ?
The cops don't get
satisfied. They get placated.
They're talkin' to the kid who
got away, the kid who called me.
Well, I called them-- scared
out of his wits, this kid.
All he can say is that the
shooter is some crazy guy.
Shooter. Jesus christ.
Yeah, he said he went nuts.
He's yelling and screaming
about, "tell him I'm coming."
"tell 'em I'm coming"
? "tell him I'm coming."
Who ? Nobody knows.
Oh, man, great. This is sure
makin' the fuck outta my day.
Come on, come on. Terry,
relax, would you, please ?
The goods are long gone.
Money's been turned around.
Middlemen are dead. This is a good
thing, huh ? So don't panic, okay ?
No one can link anybody to you.
Jenny did.
yeah, well, jenny could.
She'd already got to ya.
Valentine came into the restaurant a
couple of times. The guy's a money guy.
Five years. Long time.
There you go. Jenny must have liked him.
Jenny would say, "here's my
friend eddie." he'd shake my hand.
But the guy wouldn't even
see me. You know what I mean ?
Jenny told me she met him at a
beach, got blinded by his smile.
Can you believe that ? That son
of a bitch never smiled at me.
I mean, jenny and I, we were friends,
But, you know, we didn't travel
in the same social circles.
She had her life. I had mine.
How'd you two hook up then ?
Jenny was in my acting class.
She was 21 when she came to
me. Straight from leaving you.
Maybe you should talk to
elaine. That was her best friend.
I do double duty as a voice coach.
Not that her accent would have hobbled
her progress, not with that look.
She didn't write me, did she ?
she didn't know what to say.
I figured somebody should say
something to someone, you know ?
You're jenny's father.
Why did you come here ?
Thought it'd be nice to have
a chat with you. That's all.
no.
Why did you come here ?
Been busy, have you ? How do you mean ?
I heard you were, uh-- what
is that adorable expression ?
At her majesty's pleasure.
It was the bars then.
What was it, wembley stadium job ?
That was it, right ? Pink
floyd concert receipts ?
Earning interest in an offshore account.
Security like that can't be bought.
It must be more comforting than
having a daughter to greet you.
You can call me again.
Weren't you in a soap on the box ?
Three seasons. Who
told you that ?  Eddie ?
Yeah, eddie, yeah. He's my new china.
what ? China
plate, mate.  Me and him.
quite a character, isn't he ?
I mean, not to you, of course. To
us squares in the outside world.
He give me your address.
I gave him yours.
I guess I thought I was
being loyal to jenny,
Who told me she didn't have a father.
Before, of course,
proceeding to tell me why.
Yeah, well,
She was right in a way.
Her mum died when she was six.
After that, she was on her own.
Aunts and uncles
and then, well--
How are you gonna keep her down
on the farm after she's seen l.A. ?
They give me compassionate leave from
parkhurst to visit her in hospital.
'cause we was always
mates, jenny's mum and me.
I like to think
they're together now, you know.
Heavenly choir.
and that's
where you got the word ?
That's where eddie
wrote you ?  In prison ?
Oh, no, no, I knew. I knew before ed.
Uh, what time was it
supposed to have happened ?
Eddie said 2:00 in the morning.
That's, like, eight hours
difference between here and london.
That would have made it
about, like, 10:00 my time.
I was just goin' out in the yard.
I was in the habit of savin'
my newspaper till then.
Stretch me legs, breath of fresh air.
Bit of a read, stretch out the
good part of the day as it were.
And, I couldn't open the newspaper.
It was like the pages was glued
together. Me hands were that weak.
I thought I was havin' a heart attack.
Course I know I wasn't.
Guy I knew come up.
"here, wilson," he said,
"you're as white as a sheet."
I said, "fuck me. I been in
prison half me life, haven't I ?"
But he was dead-on, because I'd felt
all the blood drain out of me head.
And I
knew--
I knew something must
have happened to jen.
She was... Magic.
I can't believe jenny
told you all that about me.
She was always so embarrassed.
Not embarrassed.
Ashamed.
Not ashamed.
Disappointed.
Do you even know who
terry valentine is ?
Some pop music producer, isn't he ?
Whatever that means.
Anyway, he took the whole '60s southern
california zeitgeist and ran with it.
What's the deal ?  Hmm ?
You and terry valentine at 20 paces ?
Come on.  Is that it ?
I don't see why not.
Are you serious ? Have you
ever known me not to be ?
Oh, you fuckin' guys and
your dicks, man.
What do you expect me to do ?
Stay at home doing sweet f.A. ?
You don't believe it
was a car accident ?
Oh, yeah ! She fell asleep at the wheel.
Terry is never gonna give
you that satisfaction.
Depends, doesn't it ?
on what ?
I bloody ask him.
Fine !  There's the phone.
I've got his number.
Whatever you got to do,
man, you better go do it.
Looks like he's brought
in the heavy mob.
You're kidding me.
Extra muscle. Bodyguards.
They look a right load of
wallies there. You should see 'em.
Let me see. Patrolling up and
down in front of the house.
Let me see. All done up like
fuckin' household cavalry.
Those are valets, man.
Valets ?  What do you mean, valets ?
Who does he think he is, the
marquess of fuckin' tavistock ?
Valets, man, valets. They park cars.
They're having a party, looks like.
Are they ?
Thank you.
Hey, trousers, uh, keep it handy.
We're not gonna be staying long.
Yes, sir. Vengo ahora.
Well, we a little early, huh ?
Well, first in, first out. That's me.
Good evening. Mind how you go.
¶
Baby sham, eduardo ?
Dubonnet with a twist ?
Tomato juice with tabasco ?
I'll have a coke.
you have those same posters.
what ? That
you have down at your office.
No, they're different.
Well, I like the colors. We all did.
Mmm.  Must have been a time, huh ?
A golden moment.
Have you ever dreamed about a place...
You never really
recalled being to before ?
A place that maybe only
exists in your imagination ?
Someplace far away,
Half remembered when you wake up.
When you were there, though,
you knew the language.
You knew your way around.
That was the '60s.
No, it wasn't that either.
It was just '66 and early '67.
That's all it was.
¶
I'm gonna have a
butcher's around the house.
Who you gonna butcher ?
"butcher's hook.  Look."
Oop.
And I'm gonna try-- no, I don't
like that. And some of these.
Hi.
Just great.  How ya doin' ? Very
well.  Thank you. Good to see ya.
Our counterfeit c.D.S are
doing extraordinary well.
Do I know you ? I'm
very happy about that.
It was supposed to be an infinity
pool to go right off the edge.
Definitely business
affairs. Terry valentine.
Hi.  Very nice to meet
you. Good to see you.
¶
Shit.
Hello ?  Hey.
No, no, it's crestview
terrace, not crestview place.
Yeah, well, yeah, no, there's
three different ways up the hill.
The best way is to
take loma vista--
Loma lin--
loma linda.
Yeah.  Yes.
Okay.  All right.  Bye.
hi.  How are
you doing ? Good to see you.
Hi.  Well, you know, it's the
record business. What can you say ?
Oh, it's the "hi.
How are you ?" crowd ?
"hi.  How are you ?" crowd, yeah.
You know jim. Of course.  We know.
Yeah, if you can afford a house like
this, you buy a house like this, you know ?
What are we standing on ?
Trust.
You know, you could see the sea
out there if you could see it.
Could ya ?
¶
where you going ?
Hello ?
the pool's hot,
too, if you want to, you know--
unbelievable.
well, you know--
You produced the first
christopher cross album ?
Yeah, wow, that record
changed my life. Come on.
What was he like ? Just a
little bit. Just give me a scoop.
A nugget. Basically, I
just do the contracts.
That's it ? Just the
contracts ? Uh, well--
hey, babe.
Bring the motor 'round. Bang out front.
Hey, point it downhill.
As I was driving down melrose,
just taking a left on seward,
I saw this old guy locking up a car,
and it was so unmarked, it was marked.
I
mean, it was--
You got a cellular phone ?
There's a dead guy down there.
Let's call the police. You
got a phone ? No, I haven't.
Somebody better call an ambulance.
Uh, excuse me. Can I
help you ? Uh, no, thanks.
Go, go.
Sir, are you okay ?
Steady on, fangio. Man,
you "steady on," man !
What the fuck you do back there ?
- Did you ?
- That would have been too easy.
- Too easy ?
- He's gotta know why.
You think a fuckin' guy
like that ever will ?
Down ! Whoa !
Whoa !  What are you doing ? Whoa !
Fuck !  Fuck !
Wilson !  Come on, man !
Come on, come on, come on.  Shit !
Wilson.
Oh, boy. You should have
let me do the talking.
Why ?  Because you're
my security consultant ?
What the fuck is going on ?
What did you tell them ?
I told them that a longtime
employee flipped out.
That he had drug problems
and he refused counseling,
Which as it happens is true.
And he committed suicide.
Jim, how the fuck do you stop
gordon at 400 pounds ?  Oh !
That was good.  Good. Well, he's
heavier than that now, isn't he ?
Now, jenny never told you about her dad.
Her dad ?  What dad ?
The one that was in
prison for nine years.
He was released last month.
Jenny's father was in prison ?
For what ? Armed robbery.  Again.
Oh, again.  Oh, god. He's
a career criminal, terry.
He's on leave of absence.
Get it ? Where are you going ?
Don't you think I ought to
find him before they do ?
Oh, man, I am fucking screwed
and screwed to the wall.
Look, I don't suppose he entered
this country under his own name.
Oh, give me a fucking
break. Can you do that ?
Well, I would, if I came this
far to kill someone. Oh, man.
Okay,
Not even one of your
guys should handle this.
What do you want me to do ? Tell them ?
No, I mean-- I told them I
didn't know who the guy was.
People come, people go. How the
fuck are you gonna find him ?
Terry, he's not james bond, you know.
This is some pathetic sad sack wandering
around. You tell that to gordon.
What's England anyway ? Some rinky-dink
country half the size of wyoming...
Where the cops don't even carry guns ?
This is getting all too close to me.
You know something ? People close
to you keep falling in the canyons.
Oh, well, now, that's brilliant.
Hey, relax. I have other resources.
I have other resources.
No one even near to me,
Because I am out of here.
I'm gone.
How do you keep getting
so lucky, terry ?
I learned how to skate
when I was a little boy.
Well, you know, you can
have a dozen interventions,
But if the person doesn't
want to face up to it--
I guess not.
All the people in the music industry
have been taken down by doing too many--
Many... Drugs.
All right, straight rotation.
No bullshit. You call your shots.
You scratch on the eight,
you lose.   Sound good ?
that's good. You let me break ?
Yeah, break 'em up.
- He broke last time.
- What'd you say ?
So what, man ? Look at
him.  He loves to break.
Look, he's all excited.
I see that. He's excited.
I don't give a shit if he
likes to break.  It's my break.
I'm not baby-sitting
this guy. I won the break.
"I won the break."
what the fuck is that ?
Are these your quarters ? Yeah.
What the fuck is this guy doin'
? What the fuck is goin' on ?
Why don't you go fuck yourself ?
And take mr. Goodwrench with ya.
I'd tell you to blow it out your
ass, but my dick's in the way.
So--  uh-oh. Did
I cross the line ?
Does that mean you forfeit ?
I just wanted to play
the fuckin' game. Stacy !
How's it goin', kid ? Not bad.
How'd you like to kill
someone for me ? Okay.
Same as last time. The rest after.
Where do we go ?
When you find the guy you'll know.
What shit is this ? I just
do it. I don't organize it.
I can point you in the right direction,
but you've got to take it into the end zone.
This bum's a
hit-and-run gunman.
I figure he's not
cruising the polo lounge.
This is unfucking
professional, man. Oh ?
A successful man like
me has limitations.
I lose touch at the street level, so I
have to depend on a smart boy like you,
Who's a lot closer to the
nitty and the gritty than I am.
Fuck you, mr.
Whatever-your-name-is, all right ?
This is a lifestyle I embrace.
That's why I'm letting
you take care of this.
I'm the one with
appearances to maintain.
But who gives a shit
about you ? Not even god.
Get it done.
Get a tie.
How much ? Five grand.
hey !
Got half in my pocket.
You makin' trouble for someone ? Yep.
Which kind ?
The forever kind.
maybe she doesn't
even know the english dude.
I don't know. Avery said
she was tight with the guy's daughter.
that don't mean nothin'.
I don't know.  I just
said, "she's nice lookin'."
And I said, "so what ?" you
think she's any happier ?
What do you mean, "any happier" ?
Any happier than any other
asshole in this life ?
I don't know. I never met her.
Why don't they make shows
about people's daily lives...
You'd be interested
in watching, you know ?
Like sick old man or
skinny little weakling ?
Big fat guy.  Wouldn't you watch
a show  called big fat guy ?
I'd watch that fuckin' show. Extras--
excuse me, "background artists," right ?
"hey.  Hey, mom.  Hey,
dad. How's it goin' ?
Yeah, hollywood's great. Still a loser."
I wonder what it's like to have tits.
Jesus, are you gay enough, or what ?
hello, studio city ! Fag.
Look at this guy.  Oh, yeah, they
need that right away.
What's the smartest thing that
ever came out of a woman's mouth ?
Einstein's cock.
That little kid's kind of cute, though.
You know what I mean ?
She's a little young, but--
You wanna run it with me now ?
Did you forget your words ?
- John, I got him. Step aside, ma'am.
-
Come with us.
Wasn't half crowded in the
back of that car, wasn't it ?
Drug enforcement ?
Narcs ?
God.  I don't suppose you'd
prefer a steady income, hmm ?
I've got a steady
income. I'm on the dole.
A leach on the welfare
state, in addition.
You don't miss a trick.
Just a fiddle.
They've got me down as an
immigrant with five kids.
yeah.
Jenny spoke fondly of
her imaginary siblings.
Do you even remember the
last time you saw her ?
I remember every time I saw her.
I watched her grow up...
In increments.
she told me you
were a ghost in her life.
Daddy, the friendly ghost.
well, she twigged
by the time she was eight or nine.
I wasn't in the royal marines...
Or playing iago in some
world tour of othello.

She was always threatening
me. Can you imagine ?
"if you're
naughty, dad, I'll put the law on ya.
Promise."
She didn't want me to
get sent down again, see ?
And if she got wind that
I was planning something,
"I'll shop ya, dad. I
promise I'll shop ya."
I can see her pickin' up the phone.
"look, dad, I'm callin'
the old bill right now !"
It became a sort of joke between us.
She never would've turned you in.
Not in a million years.
Oh, I know that.
But as time went on--
Well, went in ever
decreasing circles--
The joke wore off.
She had a feeling...
About this
last job--
How long I'd get banged up for.
Said she wouldn't be around this time...
When I got out.
How are you doin', then
? All right, are ya ?
Now, look, squire. You're the
gov'nor here, I can see that.
I'm on your manor now, so there's no
need to get your knickers in a twist.
Whatever this bollocks is that's goin'
down between you and that slag, valentine,
It's got nothin' to do with me.
I couldn't care a less. All right,
mate ? Let me explain to you.
When I was in prison...
The second time--
Uh, no, tell a lie. Third
stretch, yeah. Third.  Third.
There was this screw what
really had it in for me,
And that geezer was top of my list.
Two years after I got sprung,
I sees him in holland park.
He's sittin' on a bench
feeding bloody pigeons.
There was no one about. I could've gone up
behind him and snapped his fucking neck--
wallop-- but I left him.
I could've nobbled him, but I didn't.
'cause what I thought I
wanted wasn't what I wanted.
What I thought I was thinkin'
about was something else.
I didn't give a toss.
It didn't matter, see ?
This bloke on the bench
wasn't worth my time.
It meant "sod all" in the end.
'cause you've got to make a choice when
to do something and when to let it go.
When it matters and when it don't.
Bide your time. That's what prison
teaches you, if nothing else.
Bide your time and
everything becomes clear,
And you can act accordingly.
There's one thing... I don't understand.
The thing I don't understand is...
Every motherfucking word you're sayin'.
Do you know what I reckon ?
You and I are after the same
thing but for different reasons.
And what would that be ?
Start with the "thing."
I would hazard a guess that
whatever you're after...
Involves a considerable sum of money.
And that's not what lights your fire ?
In the past, granted,
I have been known to
redistribute wealth.
But, no, I'm after another kind of...
Satisfaction.
You're not from around here, are ya ?
You're not carrying any kind of I.D.
Who, me ? I.D., no.  No.
When your chaps went through my
pockets, there was nothing there.
What's your connection
to terry valentine ?
My daughter was living
with him when she died.
That terry valentine grafted
you out of your share of.
When I say
"grafted," I--
You think terry valentine
screwed me out of some deal ?
It wouldn't surprise me. I mean, he's
about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
what could
this deal have been, I wonder,
To have set in motion such an
unfortunate chain of events ?
Hmph.  It could have been anything.
A shitload of heroin imported
from somewhere or other,
The usual scumbags involved.
But, you know, the
thing about scumbags is:
No matter what they do with the drugs,
the harder thing to move is the money.
In my line of work, the best
thing to do is to follow the money,
Because you can't hide the money.
You can only disguise
it. So what do you do ?
You find some rich fool to bank all the
cash coming in, make it look legitimate...
In exchange for skimming
a percentage off the top.
Maybe as much as a million
dollars commission ?
A rich fool who overextended
himself over time,
In danger of not being so rich anymore.
But I can't be sure.
I can't prove anything.
Anything at all.
What was your daughter's involvement ?
That's what I wanna know.
I was hopin' you might.
The security guard that
works for valentine,
He's the one who sent
those creeps after you.
I shouldn't wonder.
Yeah, it must've been.
He's kind of a slippery fellow, but he
keeps his hands clean and valentine's.
Darn it. There go my...
Slippery hands again.
There was an incident in downtown
los angeles a couple of days ago...
That may have spurred this...
Most recent... Activity.
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, right ?
Thank you.
Your daughter, she had a
fondness for dangerous men ?
Shame about the money, though,
Goin' into valentine's
pocket and not yours.
I don't give a shit about the money.
Personally, I prefer the heroin.
See, crooks move faster than the system,
So if we're gonna clean
up the neighborhood,
We don't have time to wait for things
like search warrants and trials.
Procedure becomes whatever
you gotta do on the day.
Oh.  Cheers, mate.
Go with god.
Yeah.
¶ I like to dream ¶
¶ yes, yes, right
between my sound machine ¶
¶ on a cloud of sound
I drift in the night ¶
¶ any place it goes is right ¶
¶ goes far, flies near to
the stars away from here ¶
¶ well, you don't know ¶
I was comin' back from,
um, a motorcycle classic...
In a place called sturgis, south dakota,
And on my motorcycle on u.S. Highway 14,
On just that side of spotted
horse, I ran into a deer.
I hit a deer. I had no chance.
Even though the highway patrol had--
Highway people had
mowed the sides--
Where the culverts
were, they couldn't mow.
And this doe just jumped right
in front of the bike !
I had a chance to say one word.
It was, "fuck !" and I hit it.
I know this: If the bullet's coming
my way, and I see my name on it,
I won't be calling for my
mother.
But, man, I tell ya, I think the only reason
I'm alive and telling this story now...
Is because of the big f.L. Front end
and that solid tire on my fat boy.
Oh, your fat boy. Yeah.
Exactly.  I was wearing-- it
was the fat boy.
I saw the ground, and I
thought, "mmm, put it down."
And I just rode the bike
down into the ground.
Just perfect-- you told
me this story before.
Did I really ? Yeah, you did.
I'm sorry.
But I'll hear it again if
you want. Oh, you're sweet.
God, you are wonderful.
What's the matter ?
Nothing. It must be hard
to pass on this road, huh ?
Oh, the freeway's faster, but
it lacks a certain majesty.
It's just the car behind us has
been following us for a while.
I sure hope so.
¶
where is big sur ?
how far ?
That's where he's scarpered.
You shouldn't go back to your
place. Not till this is settled.
what's a sliding scale ?
a sliding scale
? Well, a sliding scale, um--
If we were in a union, we'd
all make different rates...
So, he's been-- that's
not a sliding scale.
What do you mean ? That's
not a sliding scale.
Well, what's a sliding
scale ? A sliding scale is--
The scale is, you know-- you start
off somewhere, and you move up...
That's a sliding scale.   he
doesn't know what a sliding scale is.
-   you move down ?
-
Dogshit cues, man.
I swear a branch off a tree outside
is straighter than this thing.
Go ahead, man. Break 'em up.
Yeah ?
I just got chewed out.
You fuckin' believe that ?
what does he want from us ?
That's what I said. "what the
fuck do you want us to do ?
You didn't tell us there was gonna be all
these negroes following the guy around too."
Something's on, man.
What ?
Let's just say I happen to know a little
more about mr. What's-his-name avery...
Than he thinks I do about
him and his... Operation.
So, man, I got a guy on the inside.
Who's that ? You know that
putz, tom, from seattle ?
I don't know him. Tom
johanssen ? Yeah, from seattle.
I sent him to avery. What'd he say ?
"what'd he say ?" he said they're
taking a road trip up the coast.
You know, him, avery, a couple of guys.
Well, do you think we ought
to hit this english guy again ?
Yeah, man, yeah. If he hasn't
gotten whacked in bucktown,
We might still have our aces.
I just can't fuckin' figure
out who this guy is, you know ?
A courier, buyer, seller ?
Anyway--
Avery wants him.
Those jigs wanted him.
You can bet your ass there's
a briefcase somewhere.
A briefcase ? So what
do you think is in it ?
Drugs, cash, whatever. Both
if we're lucky, you know.
And while they're all
fucking each other over,
A couple of parties like
us can move right in.
¶ like a silent ray of sunlight ¶
¶ catching in my eyes ¶
¶ like a seagull ¶
Hey, can I ask you a question ?
Another one ?
Yeah, like, do you
have any friends, man ?
Yeah.
Could call them that, I suppose.
Yeah, down at the boozer,
Saturday night, meet the chaps.
Friends and colleagues.
a lot of 'em are gone.
The old faces.
Don't know where.
Different characters nowadays.
Different assumptions.
You don't know where you are.
The last load of friends I had,
Well, it turned out they
weren't my friends after all.
Hey, elaine, do you ever even understand
half the shit this guy's saying ?
No, but I know what he means.
You know, I should be
in paris or kurdistan.
no, he'd
find you in kurdistan.
Why don't you try london ? He has a
history of being apprehended there.
you're a
font of optimism. Mmm.
what the hell else have
your little techies come up with ?
Terry, we're trying to hunt him down.
I've got my foot soldiers out
there. What more can I do ?
And if he comes here ?
And ? What if he does ?
Yeah.
so you don't
want to tell me about this ?
About being here... With the
bodyguards and everything ?
I don't suppose you've ever
had anything like enemies.
Well, I never went out
for the cheerleading squad,
And I never stole anyone's
boyfriend that I know of.
So, no, I'd like to think not.
You never will.
Well, come on, now. I don't want
anybody limiting my possibilities.
That won't happen either.
This
is--
This is just a precaution.
I'm sorry.  I-- I didn't
mean to... Drag you along.
I-I needed
you to, um--
I just don't-- you
don't want to be alone ?
You see ? You understand
that about me already.
where is she ?
terry scattered
her ashes from a boat.
He buries her at a private service.
Private for who ? Him ?  Shit.
Jenny lived at the beach
when she moved here.
She was from an island.
shit !
¶

I would've given her anything
she wanted, but she didn't want--
She found out about my deal !
She said she was gonna turn me in.
She said she was gonna call the cops.
I couldn't stop it. It
already happened. It was over.
She was going to call
the cops. She meant it.
She had the phone in her hand.
So--
You're english.
Yeah, that's right.

Leaving home or coming

Where else ?
Nine ye--  wow. Is that

Well, time off for good behavior.
It was these other lads what

And then just when I
finished me nine years--
Me contract--

I had to bugger off to the states.
Well, it sounds like you need a rest.
Yeah, could be.
