Looks real close.
Can't get a clear shot.
Give me a sec.
Beginning scan.
Negative. It's not a match.
Okay, Bulldog, take the northwest quad.
Samuel's in position?
We're just waiting on Miles, sir.
They give you two things when you're a cop-
a gun and a badge.
I have one.
I can't find my badge.
- It's on the thingy.
- The thing, the thing?
I was just over by the thing.
It's not there.
Shortie, remember our plan.
You're gonna stay strong, I'm gonna give you food.
Just don't tell Mom
I gave you that, all right?
Daniel Fisher. Hmm?
I'm tryin' to build
the world's most dominant pug.
He's going through a bulking phase.
Look at him.
Come here, Shortie.
Come on. Daddy's bad.
Come here.
I'll show you the thingy.
The thing.
"It's by the thing."
- I was just-
-  The thingy.
- This is the thing.
- Yeah.
- I didn't know you meant that thing.
- Course not.
Yeah? It only takes you two, honey.
Come on.
- I think it's a strong two.
-
Go to work.
Be safe, okay?
Okay. Go.
Love you, Shortie.
- Hey, Hank!
- Hey, Molly!
Come on.
Aw, shit. I am definitely not smarter
than a fifth grader.
Hey, man. What's going on?
So you, uh-you gotta get permission from
the old lady and the dog now to come to work?
- Just the dog.
-
F.B.I.'s tracking this guy through the Quarter.
They need some hand-holding.
Coming out of the hotel.
Gator's on Royal, 200 block.
All available agents, scramble.
We need a clear lock. Get audio in place.
He's moving towards Bourbon.
I'm 50 yards back.
Hold position.
- Sir, the locals need-
- Shut up!
Show me that Irish bastard.
Confirmed. All teams,
we have a positive I.D. on Miles Jackson.
The man decapitated his own brother
for blowing a deal in Tangiers.
It's game day, people.
Let's go.
Got him.
- He's got his cell phone out now.
- Sir, he's making the call.
Hey, open up Samuel's feed.
It's an incoming call, sir.
Still encrypted.
Fifteen minutes.
The abandoned wharf on Permission Way.
Miles is bringing the weapons,
and we're making the exchange.
- I need Team 1 to get me set up inside.
- Samuel, remember our deal.
You ever want to see your brother again,
you do as I say when I say it.
We get Miles, we get the weapons,
you and Joshua get your freedom.
Now we dance.
- No! Hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no.
- Hang on. He stopped.
Let's see.
He takes your bishop knight to c4...
pawn to a7, rook to block.
He takes your queen.
It's all over but the crying.
Try, uh, pawn to a6.
It's better.
He's heading east.
Mobile Unit 6 has video on him,
hundred yards back.
Have them establish
a 10-block perimeter around the wharf.
- Sir, should you call the director?
- No.
This is the first time Miles has been
out in the open in two years.
The director has no idea
you're about to cut a deal.
There is no deal.
We use Samuel and Joshua to get to Miles.
We bring 'em all down.
Nobody's going anywhere, Ray.
This time, he's not getting away from me.
Just give me the scoop, man.
So, you gonna pop the question, or what?
I'm just saying, you know, you move in
with the lady, the ring usually comes next.
Bro, it's been two weeks.
- And?
- Yeah, you've lived with, like, 14 different girls.
Why, yes, I did. But I'm sexier than you.
I mean, if a freakishly large man
such as yourself...
is gonna keep a fine woman like Molly,
you're gonna have to put her in cuffs.
E.T.A: two minutes.
Cameras are up inside the wharf.
- Okay, we're in first position.
All teams, on my mark.
We get Miles to lead us to the location
of the guns, we proceed with extract.
Okay, so... this is how
this rodeo is gonna work.
I give you the P.D.A.
with the coordinates to the weapons.
- It's all very simple.
- No.
I can't do this.
Don't you do this, you son of a bitch.
You can't do what?
-
- I set you up.
They-They know you're here.
And now I'm never gonna
see my brother again.
Half an hour, Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.
You bring me my brother,
I'll bring you Miles.
That is, of course,
if he makes it that long.
- Holy shit.
- Hey, let's move.
Get me an outside feed.
Give me the outside feeds!
You got it.
Sir, we need to stop 'em
before they get to the bridge.
Get me a 20 on Joshua.
- Samuel is gonna try to get his brother.
- You want to make a deal?
Ray, pick up the phone!
The F.B.I. told us exactly where
they were positioned. Go around.
You all right?
It's gonna bruise like a bitch.
You're lucky I didn't aim any lower.
Man, it's just like those pansy-ass feds.
I mean, they call us, we jump right away.
Those guys skin my ass, Danny,
they really do.
Look at this guy-
arms trafficking, espionage, murder.
Hell, he even sold two dirty bombs
in Paris last year.
Interpol says he's got
two more on the market.
Like the city needs more to deal with?
I mean, really, why can't they take that crap
someplace else- Kansas, Iowa?
- Helsinki.
-
- Sounds like the feds dropped the ball again.
- Surprised?
Someone broke into the safe house.
They took Joshua and killed our agents.
- He did it again.
- How do you want to proceed with the convoy?
Well, take 'em!
Take 'em.
I threw in an extra five percent,
for treating my brother and I so well.
- Was it any trouble getting him out?
- For me?
Nah. For the two guards
I had to kill, maybe.
- And he's waiting at the airfield?
- Yeah, he's there right now.
Why don't you give him a call?
If I hadn't have found out the F.B.I.
was holding your brother...
you'd have gone along with this whole
double-cross without so much as a consideration.
- And I'd be out of my hard-earned cash.
The F.B.I. would probably
have me in custody...
and you and your douche bag brother...
would be holding hands somewhere
in the south of France.
Yeah? Hello.
I'm sorry. Joshua can't come to the phone
right now, but thanks for the ride.
Oldest trick in the book, Sam.
Turn their heads with one hand...
quietly slip out the back with the other.
Later.
- Right on time, baby.
- Aren't I always?
Mmm!
Show me.
I'll drive.
- Whoo!
- Right.
- Unit 14 en route for Lower Nine.
- Whoa!
-
Uh, my bad.
Turn around.
Turn-What are you talkin' about?
Danny, we're at black. We gotta get over there.
We gotta stop that car.
That's the girl- the girl in the car.
Oh, Jesus. All right.
Pull over, please.
Come on. You heard Dispatch.
We're lookin' for an Irish dude in a gray van.
- You think this is a good idea?
- Just ask her the questions.
Such a waste of time.
License and registration, ma'am.
- Evening. License and registration, please.
- Yeah, of course.
Hope I'm not in any sort of trouble.
How does everything look?
Oh, outstanding.
But tell me, what's a pretty lady like you
doin' drivin' all by herself...
through a neighborhood like this?
Sometimes I like to be alone.
Sometimes I don't.
- Uh, give me a second.
- Yeah. No problem.
Dude, do you wanna see her face?
- Here. Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.
here's my card, you know,
for those times when you don't.
Ask her to open the trunk.
Ask her.
I'm gonna need you to pop your trunk.
- Gun!
- Shit!
- This just got interesting.
- I got this.
You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah.
- Where'd he get you?
- He shot me in my ass.
- In your ass?
- Shut up.
- Keep pressure on it. Three minutes to E.M.S.
- Hang on!
- There's one on foot.
- Left or right?
- I don't know, baby.
- You watch that side, I'll watch this side.
Pursuit on foot.
Parallel to Duquense.
Suspect's in a gold BMW.
There he is.
- Where do I go? What do I do?
- Left on Saint Claude, right on Montmartre.
We cross the bridge.
We get on the jet.
We never see the New Orleans
Police Department again. I promise.
- Police business.
-
Okay. Keep goin'.
This guy's really starting to annoy me.
- Where'd he go?
You see him?
- Move!
-
Damn!
Down, boy! Down!
Officer Fisher, still on foot pursuit.
Subject's headed towards the marina.
It's, like, two blocks to the bridge.
Home free.
- Move, move, move!
- Hands in the air now!
- Now!
Erica!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Who are you?
- On the ground!
What's your name?
Officer Fisher.
I'll remember you.
On the ground.
I'm tryin' to figure out what's worse, man-
your shootin' at this table
or your shootin' at the range.
Aw, he's got jokes, huh?
I'll take those, Jesse.
Hey, mama, this might be a little strange,
but Danny wants to know if you think I'm sexy.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Inquiring minds got to know.
- You're safe. We had him neutered.
- See? Safety first.
Ooh, whoo!
You're an animal.
- Hey, a toast.
- Right on.
To my partner.
One year ago tomorrow, we made detective.
Okay. Maybe it had somethin'
to do with the fact...
that you captured
an international arms dealer.
Hey, but seriously, bro, I mean,
from patrols in the Lower Ninth to this?
- Doesn't ever bother you?
Benefits of bein' a minor celebrity?
Hell, no!
You just never think about what would
have happened if we had stayed put...
and called for backup that night,
like we were supposed to?
Ah, aside from the fact that I wouldn't
have a bullet hole in my ass cheek?
Yeah, besides that.
No, Danny, not at all. You know what?
Neither should you.
Just sayin'.
A girl dies that night,
and we get promoted.
Can I get a cup?
- That's it?
- I got to.
- Aw, come on. It's fellas' night out. One more.
- We've had like six one mores.
I gotta go home. Why? Because
that beautiful woman, that annoying dog-
you know, they're waitin' for me.
All right, all right.
I can't argue with that, bro.
All right, man.
Good luck.
Aw, come on, son. I don't need luck.
This ain't about luck.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
- This is not a big deal, okay?
- Two inches of water on the floor. Look at Shortie.
I know. Phil's gonna be here
in a few minutes.
That's all I need- put another one
of that guy's kids through college.
This is not a big deal.
This is our home.
Apparently our home is made
of durable papier-mâché.
Stop. Stop it.
Look, I have to go to the hospital.
I'm doin' another night shift.
- I'm putting you and Shortie in charge.
- Fantastic.
- We're fucked.
I'm gonna start sleepin'
in the guest room.
Love you guys.
- What stop valve?
You said you'd take care of it yourself,
save a little cash.
- I spent all afternoon underneath that sink.
- I was gonna get to it.
- When? Two months ago?
- That's when I just bought the new car.
- I was tryin' to save some cash.
- I can't handle this. I- I'm gonna be late.
- Molly?
- Danny, what?
Look, I need a little help here, okay?
First it was the gas bill, and then
the air conditioning, and now the sink?
I mean, I love you.
I just- I need to know that I can trust you
with these things. That's all. Okay?
I'm sorry.
I gotta go.
Molly, wait.
Look, I'll see you in the morning, okay?
-
It's the ones that go underneath the sink-
those are the ones that you don't want
to have walk away.
Yeah.
Is this Officer Fisher
of the New Orleans Police Department?
Detective Fisher.
Who's calling?
This is Miles Jackson.
- How you been?
- Why the hell are you calling me?
Say hello-
chat about the weather...
see if you fancy a quick bite.
Yeah, prison food tastes like shit.
Yes, it does.
One of the many reasons that I left.
I put you there, Miles. I'm pretty sure
I'd know if you were out by now.
Really, Danny?
I'm sorry to tell you, but I think you might
have been left out of the loop on this one.
Okay. So, where are you?
Close enough to smell Molly in the shower
while you were takin' your little nap.
It's a real shame about the plumbin',
'cause I was really startin' to enjoy the show.
-
I don't know where you are
or what you're doin'.
You come anywhere near me and Molly,
I swear to God-
Danny, please shut up.
You killed the love of my life.
That was an accident, Miles!
Oh, and poor Phil.
He was really looking forward
to those pork chops.
Phil!
Phil, get out of the house!
Now, see, that was an accident.
Okay, you listen
very carefully to me, Danny.
It's our anniversary.
One year ago today, whether by dumb luck
or uncompromising skill, you bested me.
And as such, today we're going
to have our rematch.
I just took Round 1.
The last time we met, you took from me
what can never, ever be replaced.
And for that, I am going to take from you.
Now I just wonder, do you think Molly
is gonna be able to trust me?
Miles! Miles!
- Keep him safe.
- All right.
Excuse me. Could I just use your phone?
I need to call my daughter.
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.
Great.
- From her house.
-
Okay. Um-
- Molly!
How about Camille's mom?
Molly!
- Police! Out of the car!
- What?
- Out of the car. Come on.
- Okay.
-
-
Hey!
Hey, watch it!
- That's great!
- Yeah, no problem.
- Holla at your boy.
- Hank.
Call D.O.T. Have them stall
the  ferry.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on, Danny? Slow down.
Miles Jackson.
He broke out of prison. If we don't stop
that ferry in the next 30 seconds...
- I'll never see Molly again.
- All right, all right. D.O.T. I'm on it.
- Did you get good grades?
Try to get some of your homework done
while you're there.
- Bye-bye. Thank you so much.
- Hey, no problem.
- Sorry it took a little longer.
- No. Don't worry.
Whoa, whoa! Detective Danny Fisher.
Secure this area now.
Ladies and gentlemen, hold it!
Stop for a minute.
-
- Danny.
Where is she?
She's gone. She just gets
on the ferry and she's gone.
Hey, hey. Calm down. Maybe she's just on
the streetcar on the way to the hospital.
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.
He said I took from him what could
never be replaced. He's gonna kill her.
Hey, Danny.
Danny, that's not gonna happen, okay?
- We're gonna find her. We're gonna get her back.
- Molly, come on. Pick up.
Pick up!
Molly Porter's phone.
- Let me talk to her.
-
How do you know she's not dead already?
I'm just teasing, Danny.
Come on. Come on.
Where's your sense of humor?
- Here. Say hello to your boyfriend.
- Danny, please.
- Molly! Molly, where are you?
That one was for free.
I'm gonna find you.
I'm gonna hunt you down,
and I'm gonna kill you.
It's a game.
What, you like games, don't you?
Mousetrap, Monopoly, naked Twister.
This one's called 12 Rounds.
The only way to keep her alive-
you do exactly what I say when I say it.
You gotta be kidding me. You can't expect me
to believe that you're gonna keep-
Well-You'll believe
what I tell you to believe, Danny.
In 15 minutes I will be calling
a particular cell phone in the city.
Why don't you return to where we first met,
see if you can pick up my scent once again?
Okay, uh, Molly said she
was in a silver van, okay?
They can't be more
than six blocks from here.
- Put out an A.P.B., get a trace on Molly's cell.
- Okay.
No. This is where we stopped the car.
This is where it started.
And this is where he shot me in the ass.
But I don't see anything.
- How much time?
- Uh, we got 10 minutes.
- That's today's date.
That's a code. Uh-
We got degrees.
We got clocks.
Yeah, those aren't real clocks though.
There's-There's no hours.
Uh, countdown?
No, no, no. It's just, uh,
two degrees, two clocks.
Degrees, minutes, seconds.
"X."
Longitude and latitude. That's a location.
That's where we're gonna find the phone.
Longitude and latitude. How the hell
do you know about this stuff, Danny?
Eighth-grade geography, brother. Let's go.
Okay, read 'em back to me.
No, no, no, no. Twenty-nine degrees,
Yeah. Got it.
That's my brother's firehouse.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Hey, bro. We're doing an all-day Ping-Pong
tourney. Why don't you come on down?
- You at the station?
- Why are you shouting?
Get everybody out. There may be a bomb
in the house. I'll be there in two minutes.
I need the computers patched.
I need a full phone bank.
- Everybody out?
- Yeah.
Danny, you really think this guy
put a bomb in the firehouse?
This guy blew up my house. He took Molly.
I have no idea what he's gonna do next.
Fifteen seconds.
He said he was gonna call a
particular cell phone here.
You hear that?
It's right there. It's right there.
-
Hey, Jansen.
Give me a second.
- Hello?
-  Look at that, Danny. Right on time.
You've just earned yourself
extra minutes on the next task.
There's a fire
in the Orleans Savings and Loan.
by 5:55 exactly...
or there's gonna be an early knockout.
You gotta be shittin' me.
Uh, not enough time.
I'm just gonna come in.
Hey, hey. Tel-com is up on your phone.
They just think they found the van
that Miles used to take Molly.
I'm gonna go back and set up a war room,
all right? You okay?
Molly needs you to focus.
All right?
We gotta do this.
You gotta help me find her.
When have I ever
let you down before? Huh?
You're right.
All right?
Go get this done.
- Detective Fisher?
- Yeah.
Ray Santiago, F.B.I.
This is Inspector George Aiken.
We understand that Miles Jackson's
resurfaced in the area.
- What'd you just say?
- Miles Jackson.
- We heard he tried to contact you-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy breaks out of prison,
F.B.I. knows about it, and nobody tells me?
- We understand that you're upset, Danny-
- It was none of your business.
You can keep on crying about
what you did and didn't know...
or you can tell us everything that happened
this morning since you woke up.
That is, if you want your girl back.
- Danny, you catching a ride?
We're your best chance, Danny.
Tell us what we wanna know,
we'll tell you what you wanna know.
-
- You better talk as fast as they drive.
There was a prison break
in Florida two weeks ago.
and demanded 30 cars
to drive out of the prison.
- And you gave them to them?
- Wasn't exactly our choice, Danny.
puts everyone back in their cells.
- Everyone except Miles.
- Would you please just shut up?
You're killing me with the whining.
I know you "arrested" him,
but you still don't know.
mmm, that interests me very little.
the fact that he's
shown himself in the city-
that interests me quite a bit more.
You wanna catch Miles?
That's fine.
I wanna keep Molly alive,
and I know what I gotta do.
Just stay the hell out of my way.
I guess he didn't hear me
about the whining.
Sir, this is exactly what Miles wants.
Danny? What, are you best friends now?
Miles is distracted,
he might make a mistake-
and I'll bury him.
Come on!
- Dave.
- Danny.
- Six minutes.
Smoke on 10, guys.
Come on. Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go.
Let's get a line up there.
Let's go!
Keep moving! Keep moving.
Listen up!
Listen up.
I need everybody.
All right. Thirty-two minutes ago,
Molly Porter was taken from the Canal Street ferry.
We need every security camera, every
possible witness, every vehicle plate number.
This asshole calls again,
I wanna know where he is.
about touching one hair on her head.
This could be your girlfriend,
could be your wife.
Could be any one of us.
All right.
This asshole cannot win.
-
- Dave!
- Yeah.
Watch yourself.
How much time?
Two minutes.
Hold this.
Right there.
Danny.
-
Surprise!
Sometimes victory is not
all it's cracked up to be.
Eh, Danny? Round 5!
You now have less than seven minutes
to cross the 23 city blocks...
between here
and the Nicholls Street Wharf.
Seven minutes?
We won't even be out of the building
in seven minutes.
That's if we take the stairs.
What are you doing?
You got gloves?
Give them here.
When you get out of here, you get to Atlanta,
you find Mom and you stay with her.
Make sure she's safe.
I don't want this guy havin' another chance.
- Anchor this down.
- Danny-
Anchor it down!
Danny, you can't do this!
Oh, shoot!
Do you see that man?
- Danny!
-
Hey, what are you doing?
Look out!
-
-
- What's that sound, Danny?
- I'm driving a fire truck.
- Are you sure that's such a good idea right now?
Oh!
Call the bomb squad!
Get them to Nicholls Street Wharf! I gotta go!
Stay with him.
- Hey! Look out!
-
No, no, no!
What are you doin'?
Yo, hey! Hey! Chill!
Sorry!
-
- Shut down the timers, Miles. I'm here.
It was the bell. The bell signals
the start of the next round.
Oh, you're finally starting
to get the hang of this.
I wanna speak to Molly.
How about I do you one better?
How about I show her to you?
you might have quite the reunion.
Tell me you didn't kill anybody
with that thing.
I need a saw.
It's clear.
- Thought you guys were gonna catch him.
- We switched out your SI M card.
We're tapped into your phone.
We can track you wherever you go.
Miles will call again, Danny. When he does,
keep him on the line for 30 seconds.
- That's all we need.
- Miles's phone's encrypted. You can't trace it.
That's funny.
We're the F.B.I., not Mayberry P.D.
All we need is 30 seconds.
All teams, listen up, listen up!
We have a location.
I need SWAT, and I need K-9,
and I need all of you there. Now!
- Get against the wall.
- Down! Everybody down!
Blue team, seal all the exits.
I need snipers on the roof.
Shut down all communication in and out
of the building, and start with the dogs.
Ray, pull the tapes.
I need to know what room this key is for.
It's clean.
- Clear!
- Clear. Fisher!
