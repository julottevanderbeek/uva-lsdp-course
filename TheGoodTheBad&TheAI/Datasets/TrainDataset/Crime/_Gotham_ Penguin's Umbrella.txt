Oswald:
Rivers of blood
in the streets.
I know it!
I-I can see it coming!
Mooney:
It might as well be me.
Gordon:
My name is bruce wayne.
The man who did this.
Stop or I'll shoot!
Oswald:
By fish mooney and the cops.
Why snitch on your own boss?
You want to push fish out.
I told you this is important.
The old man has to go.
He figures out we're working
together, we're cooked.
Allen: You're under
arrest for the murder
Of oswald chesterfield
cobblepot.
Holy crap.
I... Am oswald cobblepot.
You son of a bitch!
Mooney:
No!
Boss, what's wrong?
Gordon didn't kill penguin
like he was told.
What?
Penguin is still alive
and working for maroni?
No.
You go find gordon,
and you bring him to me.
Still breathing.
I want to talk
to that son of a bitch.
Barbara :
Hey, guys. Leave a message.
Barbara, if you're at home,
listen to me.
I need you to get out right now.
I thought we were friends.
Harvey!
Shut up! Game's over.
Now I got to kill you and take
your body back to falcone,
And beg, beg him for mercy!
Listen to me. I screwed up.
But I have a plan
to make things right.
Don't kill me. Help me.
You think I'm an idiot?
Walk away!
Walk away.
Help me.
We don't have
to go out like this.
You better hope
you never see me again.
Wow.
What a place, huh?
A beautiful home
for a beautiful lady.
Please tell me what you want.
I guess there's no
harm in the truth.
See, your boyfriend
was supposed to kill
A certain person
for somebody.
Only, he didn't.
And now that somebody
is real mad.
Cobblepot.
What?
He didn't kill cobblepot.
There you go!
You're hip.
You are hip.
That jim gordon is
one lucky son of a gun.
What are you, like,
a hundred pounds?
:
Oh.
I bet that's your
real hair color, too.
What are you gonna...
Do to jim?
You ever been
with a criminal?
Some ladies
find it a turn-on.
Jim.
Hey!
Speak of the devil.
I was just getting
to know your lovely lady.
You're trespassing.
Get out.
Whoa. Slow down, hoss.
You're misreading the situation.
I'm the shot caller here.
The situation is you've been
told to bring me in alive,
Or I'd be dead already.
But I'm happy to kill you
right here and now.
Don't be such a hard-ass.
Come on, you know the rules.
You play nice,
you take your lumps...
Nobody else gets hurt.
Tell your friend to drop his gun
or I'll blow his brains out.
Oh, my god, jim.
It's okay. It's under control.
Drop your gun.
Okay.
Have it your way.
But now, after we kill you,
we're gonna kill blondie, too.
Nice and slow.
We've got to go.
Right now.
Barbara.
Man :
The westbound interstate express
Departs in five minutes,
bay 12.
Barbara.
What?
Listen.
No, no. No.
Just a couple of days
and I'll join you.
No.
There are things
I need to do.
Fine. Then if you stay, I stay.
Okay? Because I love you, jim.
I cannot leave you.
I love you, too.
That's why you
need to leave.
If I know you're safe, there's
nothing they can do to me.
I'll make things right,
and then I'll come join you.
And what if you don't?
Don't come back.
Don't come back to gotham.
No, jim.
Man:
Gordon's here.
Is he nuts?
What's he doing here?
You believe this guy?
Hey, alvarez.
You got any
of those blank warrants
That judge bam bam signed?
Uh... Yeah.
This cannot stand.
Gordon must die,
bullock must die,
Penguin must die today!
And maroni, too,
I suppose?
If need be.
You're overreacting, my dear.
This penguin's a nobody.
You want to start a war
Over the guy that
carried your umbrella?
He was on my hip
everywhere with me.
He knows things.
Like what?
Too much.
He knows too much!
Go to maroni
And ask him politely
to hand over your little man.
Politely.
If he refuses,
We can talk about
stronger measures.
Boss, this is
weak response.
I hate to agree with fish, but
we need to show strength now.
We need to hit back hard.
No talk.
Penguin dead, gordon dead, done.
Relax, niko.
I know what I'm doing.
Where is gordon?
I thought you were
bringing him with you.
No. He wouldn't come
without a struggle.
Now, I don't know
if he's playing tough or crazy,
But he's at work
like nothing's wrong.
I'll send victor to fetch him.
No need. My guys can handle him.
I'll send victor.
That's a nice
handsome bird, huh?
I don't know chickens.
Fall back.
The old man is
right there.
Screw him. He's done.
Now's the time to strike.
not yet.
Not yet, not yet.
If not now, when?
Look at him.
Maroni clan are laughing at us,
and he plays with chickens.
Mooney:
That's what has me worried.
The chickens.
He's happy, relaxed,
As if he doesn't have
a care in the world.
That girl of yours
is doing her job then.
No.
She says he hasn't
even touched her.
She cooks
and she cleans for him.
He likes to watch her do chores.
Weird.
But if that's his thing...
No.
He's acting as if he knows
something important
That no one else knows.
What the hell
are you doing here?
I work here. It's my shift.
Where else should I be?
How about alaska?
Arrest warrants?
For who?
Mayor aubrey james,
carmine falcone
And their close associates.
On charges of conspiracy
and perversion of justice
In the wayne murder case.
Are you insane?
No.
Maybe a little.
Feels good.
They're gonna try
and kill me anyway.
Might as well make them
pay a price for it.
You're gonna arrest the mayor
and don falcone. How?
My testimony is attached
to the warrants.
That alone is enough to
indict them on a dozen counts.
Sure, if you could execute
the warrants, which you can't.
If the d.A. Would prosecute,
which he won't.
There's not
a single cop or lawyer
In the city who will help you.
I think there are plenty
of people willing to help me
Once they see it's possible
to fight back.
You're dreaming.
Nobody will help you.
won't help you.
You don't think I want
change just like you do?
I have a family.
I understand.
Gordon...
Get out of town.
This is my home.
It was my father's home.
I'm not leaving.
Hello, everyone.
My name is victor zsasz.
I'm sent here personally
by don carmine falcone himself
On a matter
of deep concern to him,
So please be respectful.
I'm here
For jim gordon.
Only him.
Everybody else, mind your
business and we're cool.
So where's jim at?
Thank you.
Hey, jim!
:
Jim.
Hi, jim.
Relax.
I'm supposed
to take you in alive.
Don falcone
wants to talk.
Tell falcone we'll talk.
But not today.
Don't be that way.
"alive" is a very
broad category.
A man with no hands
Can still be alive.
There are 50 cops in here.
Try something.
Everybody out.
Please?!
Go, boss.
Get out of here.
Jim...
Go.
I can handle this.
Well, how now, jim?
Jim?
Jim?
Why are you hiding
from me, jim?
Officer:
Hey!
What the...?
There!
You need a ride?
Go, go, go, go, go!
No.
No, please.
Twenty-eight.
Ah. You're back.
How do you feel?
Terrible.
Where am I? Who are you?
I'm a friend of
montoya and allen.
I just took two bullets
out of you
And sewed you up.
Now I'm checking
to see how you're doing.
So...
Who are you,
what city are we in,
And what day of
the week is it?
I'm james gordon.
We're in gotham.
It's Friday.
Why are there rats?
It's the dissection lab
at the university.
I gather you're a fugitive
from the mob.
Can't go to the
hospital, said crispus.
Very exciting, I must say.
How long have I been out?
Just a couple of hours or so.
You're very lucky.
No vital organs were...
Whoa, whoa, lie back down.
Okay? You are hurt.
Just a week or so in bed...
No, I have to go.
James, you have lost
a lot of blood.
You have to do as I say
and lie back down.
If you don't, you could die.
I have to stand.
Can you help me?
Okay, okay.
Crispus?
He said
he's leaving already.
I have to go. Now.
Sure.
Some clothes would
be good though.
This is about tradition, values.
Snitches get stitches...
That's how it's
always been.
You need to hand him over, sal.
I know.
I should.
But what can I say?
The little guy amuses me.
Don falcone is going to be
very unhappy.
You want to start a war
over this punk?
War?
Whoa.
He's that important
to you, is he?
Oh, no.
He means nothing to us.
Respect is what matters here.
Respect I understand.
Penguin!
Come on out here.
Don't be scared. She won't bite.
You won't bite him, will you?
Hello, penguin.
Hello, ms. Mooney.
Maroni: Penguin,
ms. Mooney and her boss,
Mr. Falcone,
feel disrespected by you.
Oh, dear.
Well, that certainly
has never been my intention.
Maroni: Well, respect is
very important to them.
Now, I want a sincere apology
from you
For making them feel that way.
Oh, gosh, of course.
If I've in any way
Caused anyone to feel
a lack of respect,
I apologize.
Sincerely.
Maroni:
There you go.
Can't say
fairer than that.
Bloodshed, then.
I'm glad.
Jolly fat men are so tiresome.
And you...
You little
Scaly-faced bitch.
Oh... What I'm gonna do to you.
"torture" is far too nice
of a word.
I'm sorry you feel
that way, fish...
Only my friends... Call me fish.
Hey, sisters!
How's it hanging?
Holy...!
Tell your boss
falcone won't let
Any of maroni's trucks
over the bridge.
Not till he
gives up penguin.
So, listen, you got
to get hurt a little.
You want a beating or a bullet?
Why we got to get hurt?
Because we're sending a message
this is a serious issue.
We'll tell him it's serious.
No problem.
Ah, you know what?
How did they find out
about the gun truck, huh?!
That's $3 mil per
week right there!
Son of a bitch!
$4.5 mil per, gross. Cash.
Very aggressive move,
isn't it?
An overreaction.
They want to scare you.
Oh, is that right?
You think that they think
That don maroni can be scared?
Of course, you're right. No.
But why, then, would they
react so ferociously?
Why do they want me
back so badly?
I know why.
Because they know I got
A stone moneymaker here.
A golden goose.
They know it, and they
don't want us to have him.
Right, penguin?
Honk, honk.
What?
Honk, honk.
It's what geese say.
:
Oh, right, right.
Honk, honk.
So, fine, he's a goose.
Maybe we can negotiate a price,
Pay them off.
Yeah.
Yes.
Caution is wise.
The falcone clan still is
number one, after all.
Paying them off is
the safe thing to do.
Screw safe.
They want to push me?
They think I'm gonna fold?
I'll push right
back, harder.
Hit them where
it hurts. Today.
You know best.
If that's how you want
to play it,
I think I know
just the spot to hit them.
Montoya:
I owe you an apology.
You were telling the truth,
and I wouldn't believe you.
Maybe my personal feelings
towards barbara
Got tangled up in there.
And that was wrong.
Forget it.
Anyhow, I-I'm sorry
for misjudging you,
And I'm very glad
that we're on the same side now.
Yeah, me, too.
So barbara's safe though?
You're sure she's safe?
I'm sure.
Gordon, is that you?!
It's all right, alfred.
It's all right. He's a friend.
We couldn't risk
a direct approach;
There's people looking for me.
Ah, right.
Sorry about that, mate.
Can't be too careful.
In a spot of bother,
are we, sir?
Gordon: Renee montoya
and crispus allen.
Pleased to meet you.
Bruce, I promised I would find
your parents' killer.
I'm not sure I'm going to be
able to keep that promise.
It's a long story, but I'm
kind of in a tight spot.
I've upset some powerful people.
Stop treating me like a child.
Explain.
Bruce, you are a child.
You don't need to know...
You expect to die!
I'd like to know why.
Is it connected
to my parents' murder?
Yes, it's all connected.
Somehow.
Bruce...
I will do my best
to work this thing out.
But if I don't,
Montoya and allen here will
take over your parents' case.
I've told them
everything I know.
You can trust them,
one hundred percent.
One hundred percent.
Bruce, these are
good detectives.
If anyone can find
the truth, it's them.
Thank you.
Sir, what can we do
to help you now?
Nothing.
From here on in,
I have to go it alone.
I don't want anyone
else caught up in this.
I have to go.
You can hardly walk.
I'll be fine.
This way.
Not much further.
It's there.
Oswald:
Told you.
Easy as pie.
There must be a million
dollars' worth here.
Yeah, you told us, all right.
You're clever.
You're very clever.
I sense a sarcastic
and hostile edge to your tone.
Hostile?
You got that right.
You ain't no golden goose,
you're a yellow rat snitch,
And you got maroni
all twisted.
I'm so glad we're finally
clearing the air at last.
That's it.
Act smart, okay?
'cause all I got
to do right now
Is put a bullet in
your brain right here.
Bang.
See, then I go back
and I tell the boss
That one of niko's
men shot you.
Gee, that's too bad.
End of story.
Yes, that's clever enough.
I never doubted
your intelligence.
That's not your problem.
Oh, I got a problem, huh?
I got a problem.
No, you got a problem.
What's my problem, schmo?
What drives you?
What's your passion?
When you know what a man loves,
You know what can kill him.
Do you believe this guy?
For you, it's money.
You love money.
More than power
and respect.
You're a skinflint, mr. Carbone.
A cheapskate.
What are you guys playing at?
Let me go!
Sorry, frankie.
As I say, a cheapskate.
Carbone: Hey, come on!
Hey...
Consequently,
You don't pay
your people enough.
No, you know me.
You don't want to do this.
It is a sad fact...
You don't want
to do this.
No. No. No, no!
...That there is no loyalty
among thieves.
The simple offer
of a substantial pay raise
Is all it took to sway
these fine men.
So, you see,
your problem!
Your greatest passion
Becomes your greatest weakness!
Love, mr. Carbone.
Love conquers all.
Shh.
My friend.
My good friend,
today is a sad day.
Nikolai was
like a son to me,
Just as frankie
was a son to you.
We've both lost
precious family members.
My condolences to you.
And mine to you.
I want this violence to stop.
Business is good.
The arkham project
is a gold mine.
Wayne enterprises
is back in play.
Life is good
for all of us.
Why risk all of that
and go to war over trifles?
Your little man there is
obviously very valuable to you.
We'll let you have him.
Unharmed.
Our gift to you.
And as a show of
Mutual respect,
you give us something in return.
Like such as what?
How about real estate?
One of your warehouses
on the river maybe.
That's not gonna work.
I mean, I like this fella,
But we're talking about
a warehouse on the river.
Maroni:
Yeah.
Indian hill.
I'll give you
indian hill.
I'm not familiar with the name.
It's in arkham.
It's a toxic waste dump
On top of
an indian burial ground.
It's worthless.
Falcone:
No.
Nothing is worthless.
Even nothing is
worth something.
We'll take it.
As a token of
our mutual respect, yes?
You got it, my friend.
It's all love.
It's a pleasure
seeing you all.
Um, I heard vic zsasz
tore up the gcpd,
Tracking down gordon.
Did you catch him yet?
We're working on it.
Well, good luck
with that.
There's nothing more dangerous
than an honest man, huh?
Bullock: Jimbo,
it's me. Open up.
Hey.
Don't worry, I'm
not gonna kill you.
I should, but I ain't.
Glad to hear it.
Obviously, you figured you'd go
to the last place they'd look,
Because it'd be
the first place they'd reject
As being too obvious.
I-I'm sorry,
I'm being rude.
This is the duchess
of devonshire.
Duchess, jim gordon, putz.
Marsha. Hi.
Right.
Baby, why don't you
explore a little bit.
Find the bedroom,
put on your birthday suit.
And I'll find you
in a jiffy, okay? Hmm?
So I've been thinking.
You're still
a douche bag.
But you have
the moral high ground.
So I'm gonna back your play,
Whatever it is.
I figure
I'm doomed anyhow.
I might as well join
the good guys.
Thank you.
So what is your play?
I mean, you got one, right?
You said you did.
Tomorrow morning, I'm arresting
falcone and the mayor
For the framing
of mario pepper.
Conspiracy, poj,
rico, the works.
Well, that's a...
That's a hell of a plan.
You sit down with
a panel of chimpanzees
And a bucket of crack
and come up with that one?
I figure whatever else happens,
we'll stir things up.
We might even make the papers.
Oh, yeah, we're gonna make
the papers, all right.
We're gonna be dead
in the streets
In time for the evening edition.
Well, at least the people
will know the truth.
And we'll go out
doing our jobs,
Enforcing the law.
That's the best
inspirational speech you got?
Doing our jobs?
You don't have to join me.
No, I'm game.
Like I said, I'm doomed anyhow.
Now, if you'll excuse me
for one minute,
Just gonna take care
of some business.
Duchess!
Marco!
Marsha:
Polo!
Jumping catfish.
Good morning,
mayor james.
Gordon, you scared...
Scared the bejeebers
out of me.
Almost spilled
my coffee.
Sorry.
Sir, you're
under arrest.
That's not funny.
Depends where you're sitting.
Might want to take
a look at this.
How you doing, guys?
I'm here to have a chat
with mr. Falcone.
Sure thing, mr. Mayor.
Carmine falcone,
you're under arrest.
Bullock:
Move.
Lie down right over there.
Stay quiet.
What on earth are you thinking?
We're thinking
we'll take you both to jail
And charge you with conspiracy
To pervert the course
of justice.
Try and take me in,
You won't make it
to the end of the street.
That's exactly what I said.
This is a lawful arrest.
If you resist, you will be shot.
I see.
We all die together
in a blaze of glory.
If that's how it works out,
that's fine with me.
How about you, harvey?
Fine by me.
Oh, god.
Falcone:
I envy you boys.
Having nothing to lose
must be liberating.
Must feel pretty good.
Yes, it does.
Suppose you did have
something to lose.
What would you do then?
Suppose,
for instance,
I had a knife to barbara kean's
throat right now.
Would you still
be so brave?
You don't.
I'm telling you I do.
You're a liar.
I have many faults,
But I'm not a liar.
Victor zsasz has barbara.
You know victor.
You're lying. She's far away.
She came back.
Came right to me
to plead for your life.
You have a good
woman there.
She loves you
very much.
Too much.
Prove it.
Prove you have her.
I could.
But I won't.
I want you to believe me.
It's obvious, jim. He's lying.
Am I?
If you think so,
Go ahead and try to bring me in.
You'll be dead,
So you won't know what
happens to barbara.
But it won't be pretty.
Lying.
On my mother's grave.
Drop your gun,
And barbara won't be
harmed in any way.
Those muffins
smell good.
None for you, creep.
She can have one
if she wants.
No, thank you.
Got it.
What a shame.
Oh, this is embarrassing;
he straight-up
Bluffed you into folding.
We could've gone out like
heroes; now we're fish food.
Okay, so it
wasn't a bluff.
Falcone:
I'm sorry if she was
Mistreated a little.
We needed to be
Sure she had nothing
useful to tell us.
Untie her, victor.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
What am I gonna do with you?
By rights, you
have to die.
Whoa, hello.
Uh, I'm late for work.
Quite an adventure.
I'll be on my way.
Falcone:
Such a waste though.
Gotham needs men like you,
both of you.
Strong men
with principles.
I wish I could
make you see
I'm not the enemy.
The system is
not the enemy.
The enemy is anarchy.
But I told you that
before, didn't I, jim?
Yes, you did.
You didn't listen though.
Do we get a last meal or a smoke
or anything, or just talk?
Falcone: But today,
you believed me.
You trusted my word.
That's a good first step.
Perhaps there's still
hope for you.
Yes.
Go. Get out of here
before I change my mind.
Wait a minute.
Quiet.
It's been a
pleasure, barbara.
I do admire
a brave woman.
What's the catch?
Jim, he said we could go.
Let's not haggle here.
What's the catch, mr. Falcone?
I want you to think
about what I said.
I want you to
understand the truth.
That's all I ask.
The catch is...
Someday soon,
you'll see I'm right.
Barbara...
I'm sorry.
I was just trying
to help, and...
I don't know what...
I love you so much.
Mmm.
Excellent.
Delicious!
Yes.
I followed the recipe.
You're right, mr. F.,
cooking is easy.
I'm sorry you had
to see all that earlier.
Not pleasant.
I understand.
Business is business.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, it is.
I'll go see to
the chickens.
Any eggs, my dears?
Don falcone.
My friend.
Good to see you.
I was just thinking
About the night
we met.
Cut them down.
Where's the snitch?
I want to
speak to him.
Cobblepot, is it?
Condemned men are
honest men, I find.
What can you tell me
before you go?
Don falcone.
It is a great
honor, sir.
Indeed, I can tell a secret
of great value to you...
If you grant me
one last request.
Which is what?
Give the job of killing me
to james gordon.
Why him?
He's the only man
under your sway
Who has a conscience.
The only one
who might be persuaded
To spare my life.
Why would I agree to that?
I want you dead.
You're a snitch.
If you agree
and gordon spares me,
Then I will become snitch.
For life.
I will come back to gotham
under a different name,
And I will work my way
into the maroni family,
And I will snitch for you.
I am excellent at
this sort of work.
I have a gift for it.
I really do, sir.
Deal.
Gordon will get the
job of killing you.
Thank you, sir.
What is the valuable secret?
Oh, yes.
Fish mooney
and nikolai the russian
Only pretend to hate each other.
They're lovers.
And fish is
pushing nikolai
To take your place.
Is that so?
Yes, sir.
But only so fish
can take over from him.
That is a good secret.
It's almost uncanny.
Everything played out
exactly as you said it would.
We got rid of
nikolai painlessly,
And maroni thinks
you're a wizard.
You really do
have a gift.
But I think we're
making a mistake
Letting gordon live.
He's trouble.
Thank you so much
for sparing him.
I appreciate the favor.
Don't worry.
He'll see the light.
One way or another.
I guarantee it.
