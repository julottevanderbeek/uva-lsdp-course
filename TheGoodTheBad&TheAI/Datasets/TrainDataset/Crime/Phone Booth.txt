What?
Yeah, that's right.
Speaker: There are
an estimated 8 million people
in the 5 boroughs of New York.
the greater metropolitan area.
There are almost 10 million
telephone exchange lines.
Over 50 phone services.
are cell phone users.
It used to be
a mark of insanity
to see people talk
to themselves.
Now it's a mark of status.
And speed dial
is quickly replacing
the drop of a coin.
Despite increased usage
of cellular devices,
an estimated
and 2 million visitors
still utilize pay phones
on a regular basis.
Speaker:
This is the telephone booth
at 53rd and 8th,
perhaps the last vestige
of privacy
on Manhattan's West Side.
It is the last booth
of its type
still in regular operation.
Up to 300 calls daily
originate here.
This location has been
burglarized 41 times
in the last 6 months.
Verizon has scheduled
this structure
to be torn down
and replaced with a kiosk
as of 8 A.M. Tomorrow.
Hardly 2 blocks away,
meet the man who is to be
the final occupant
of that booth.
Donny. Donny, Donny,
listen to me.
I said I'd get you
magazine coverage,
and I'm getting you
in a magazine.
Look, you gotta trust me.
No means yes
to these people.
Get  magazine
on the line.
Yeah, I heard you.
Yeah, Donny,
I got  magazine
on the other line.
They want to know about you,
so I'm hanging up.
This is Erica or Lars.
I can't tell the difference.
- You got Stu.
- We said no.
And I didn't hear you,
so I'm giving you
a second chance.
We don't do magicians.
Magicians?
Donny G. Is an artist
who happens to look
like a supermodel.
The  is
offering him the cover.
Both:  wants him?
And I haven't told
my client...
my favorite client...
that I am making
this call, all right?
He wants
I want you guys.
And I can make him
come around,
but you're
gonna lose us
if I don't hear from you
by end of business.
Get Ricky at
Tell him
Is offering a cover.
Okay. Big Q.
Adam. Adam.
I know 3 people looking
for dog walkers.
That could be you.
"Sit. Stay.
Don't worry, Fluffy.
I'll clean up your shit
and wipe your ass."
You got Stu.
Yeah, what's up
with my party, Stu?
Yo, Q. I was just
telling my assistant
to get my favorite client
on the phone
and here you are. Nice.
But, uh...
But listen. Seriously, Q.
We gotta look
at a new night
for your release party.
Yeah, there's 2 premieres,
a fund raiser.
All the happening places
are booked.
If we move the date
by 2 nights...
Voodoo on you-do,
motherfucker,
from Big Q to Big Stu!
All right, Big Q.
Be reasonable.
Motherfucker,
I'm a gangsta!
I don't gotta
be reasonable!
I don't gotta
be reasonable!
You're cutting out.
Hello? Big Q?
I'll kill your ass you keep
talking about me like that!
Right?
N.Y.P.D. Blue,
Stuey, the hardest
working P.R. Guy.
How's business?
How many times
I have to tell you, Wyatt?
I'm a publicist.
Tickets.
Tickets.
right?
You know, you put the "ho"
in show business, Stuey?
It's Stu.
What you got for me?
Uh, they just checked
Mrs... uh...
Mrs. Sharp
into Bellevue again.
Tell Britney
I send my love.
Enjoy the show.
Hold on a second.
This is Lana.
Ah-choo!
Bless you.
Lana, it's Stu Shepard.
- Ah-choo!
- Bless you.
Is it you or
your boss calling?
It's me.
Listen, I'm looking
for some mutual
back scratching.
You get my privileged
N.Y.P.D. Blue info,
and I get you
to save my ass.
Not now, Stu.
I'm a sick woman.
Well, this is gonna
make you feel better.
Tony award-winning producer
jeffrey Sharp
tossed his wife back
into drug rehab today.
How nice.
What do you want
for that little tidbit?
Well, you better be nice to me
while I'm still on the way up
and taking your calls.
You know what they say,
the higher
the monkey climbs,
the more
you see of his ass.
Oh, have a heart, Lana.
Listen, earlier today,
my half-wit assistant
faxed you regarding
my favorite client.
Great singer about
to turn great actress.
Oh, another little
Miss Tits-and-ass?
Look, I'm on cell.
No names.
That was strictly
in-office information.
You didn't print it,
did you?
I got it.
All right, well, tell me
Richard didn't see it,
and he didn't put it
in the column.
Lana: Stu Something's on the phone,
scared he's gonna lose his job.
His office sent you something
by mistake. He wants it back.
Richard: You tell him T.F.B.
Put that at the top of the column.
- Stu, it ran. Sorry.
- Yeah.
Oh, God. No, no.
Yes!
Erica from
magazine.
They offered Donny G
a photo
in "What's Hot
and Happening."
Fuck 'em.
Make 'em sweat.
He's on a conference call.
He could take a while.
Uh, yeah.
Can he call you back?
Okay. All right. Bye.
Pretty smooth, Adam.
Thank you.
Now if you can
absorb everything
I'm trying to teach you,
focus,
and get a new wardrobe,
you can make it big
in public relations.
I got a sense.
Cool, cool,
cool, cool.
What's up, T?
How ya doin'?
Mario's.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Not so fast, Stu.
How come you run every time
you go past my place, huh?
Because I'm busy,
Mario.
Yeah? Yeah?
Well, no more drinks
or free meals, okay?
One lousy mention
in the
you expect to eat
for 6 months? No!
Maybe... Mario!
Just maybe I could throw
the hippest party
this month your way...
- Stu.
- No, I couldn't.
My clients
would kill me.
What? What?
What hip party?
It's just Big Q.
The hottest new rap star.
There'll be
local TV coverage,
- Adam: 9 and 11.
- 9 and 11.
MTV, B.E.T., VH1.
But I promised
other clients, Mario.
People who actually
pay me money.
Look, you owe me, Stu.
It's gotta be
the night of the 18th.
You toss in the buffet
for 80 people,
the record company
will pick up the booze,
and I will deliver you
a truckload of celebrities.
Anything you want, okay?
Expand the menu,
wallpaper
those bathrooms,
for God's sake.
And lose the chain.
You only get one shot
with celebrities.
Thank you.
Thank you, Stu.
Brilliant. That was
fucking brilliant.
Stu: Call Big Q.
Tell him we got him into
the hippest place in town
on his date.
All right.
Call  magazine.
We'll take their offer.
And messenger a bottle
ofJameson's over to Lana
at  with a note saying...
write this down.
Got it.
"Irish chicken soup.
Love, Stu."
"Irish chicken soup.
Love, Stu."
All right.
No harm being gracious.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Actually, better off,
deliver it over yourself.
Get to know
the players.
Yeah, yeah. No. I'll do
that. Definitely.
Thank you so much
for teaching me.
And, Adam,
don't you have a suit?
Uh, actually, no.
Here. Get yourself one.
I'm gonna have to start
paying you pretty soon.
Yeah, I hope so.
Stu, listen, you got
a bunch of messages.
Listen, I'm already late
for a meeting. Hold 'em.
All right.
See you, Stu!
See you, Adam!
Excuse me.
I'm trying
to make a call here.
This is for you.
Half pepperoni,
half mushroom,
extra crisp.
You ever heard
of delivering a pizza
to a fucking phone booth?
I don't think so.
"Gentleman occupying
phone booth,
Broadway and 8th."
It's a mistake.
What am I supposed
to do with the pie?
It's all paid for.
Look, there's a homeless guy
just around the block.
Give him the pizza and say,
"You can turn away from it,
but you can't make it
go away."How's that?
He'll think I'm
trying to poison him.
They always get
that idea...
Get off the fucking pizza,
all right?!
That language
is uncalled for.
Holy shit!
I'm sorry.
Please return to sender
and fuck off.
There you go. $5.
Eat the pizza yourself.
You look like you could
use a good meal.
Hello?
Pam.
Could you believe
some nutcase just tried
to deliver me a pizza
to a phone booth.
Why are you always in
the same phone booth,
same time, every day?
Well, it's
quitting time, right?
Thank God. We were
mobbed for lunch today.
So how's your day?
It's getting better
by the minute, sweetheart.
Who's the most famous person
you've publicized today?
You.
Oh, really?
I told a few gossip columnists
that Mel Gibson
was looking for actresses
for his latest film.
And I said the possibilities
were Cameron Diaz,
julia Roberts,
and my favorite client, you.
You didn't really do that.
First step
towards being noticed
is being mentioned, Pam.
Look, I just got out
of a press conference
at the City Hotel
and I was thinking
maybe you could come
down here, you know?
There are
a couple of people
and a few Martinis I'd
like to introduce you to.
Stu, l...
Listen, Pam, Pam, Pam.
It's about time
we really talked
about your career.
Come on.
Look, I feel awful
always saying no,
but I promised
my scene partner
that I'd rehearse
for class.
We're doing a scene
from
and I'm playing
Renée Zellweger's part.
That's great.
Well, look,
I rescheduled a meeting
to see you,
but I guess... I guess
I could reschedule it back.
Are you mad?
Don't worry about it.
No, I'm not mad.
Maybe tomorrow.
Yeah. Later.
- Look, Stu?
- What?
Big kiss.
You, too.
Ahem. Yeah.
Caller: Isn't it funny?
You hear a phone ring,
and it could be anybody,
but a ringing phone
has to be answered,
doesn't it?
What?
Caller: I hope you realize how
you've hurt my feelings.
Who the fuck is this?
Caller: Don't even think about
leaving that phone booth.
Wrong number, pal.
Caller: It was a perfectly
delicious pizza,
and you're certainly
going to wish
you had accepted it.
I imagine this is part
of the same gag...
The pizza bit.
That was some funny shit.
Caller: Yeah, well,
it's purpose
was to keep
your strength up
for what's coming next.
What's coming next
is I'm hanging up.
Caller:
Oh, no, you won't.
You're going to learn
to obey me.
Obey you?
Who is this?
Caller: Someone who enjoys
watching you.
Watching me?
Caller: Yes, I love the suit
you're wearing today.
The black
on raspberry sorbet.
Very Italian.
Where, uh...
Where are you?
Caller: There are hundreds
of windows out there.
Why don't you
check them out?
Yeah?
So what am I doing now?
Caller: You're scratching your head.
Now you're brushing
your hair back.
Caller: That's
not very nice, Stu.
Did you call me Stu?
Who's Stu?
I don't know any Stu.
Caller: Why, do you prefer Stuart?
Look, a lot of people
in this neighborhood
know who I am.
Caller: Stuart Shepard,
third floor front.
Go mind-fuck
some other guy, pal.
Caller: I know
Pamela McFadden, too.
It's not
in your best interest
to disconnect me.
Someone could get hurt.
Oh, what's
the matter, Stu?
Listen, if you're some
fucked-up failed actor
I wouldn't handle or
some prick intern I fired,
I will hunt you down
and I will crush you.
You will never work
in this town.
All right, trust me.
I can turn people
into gods,
and I can turn you
into a total fucking loser
if you weren't one
already.
Do you hear me?
Am I upsetting you?
Hello?
You think I'm gonna what,
pay you off or something?
Tell me what you want.
Caller: Oh, now you want
to talk to me.
Stu: Look, did Adam at my office
put you up to this?
Caller: No. I thought this up
all by myself.
All right, well,
keep thinking.
I'm hanging up.
I'll say hi
to your wife Kelly for you.
Talk to you later.
Recording: The callback
feature cannot...
Motherfucker.
Tell me what you want.
Caller: I want
your complete attention.
Are you an actor?
Yes, one of
your pathetic failed ones.
Yeah, well, it's tough
when you're not known.
Caller: Tell me about it.
You don't have
to hunt me down
and crush me.
I can't get work
in this town
as it is.
I've done
some off-Broadway,
some off-Manhattan plays,
but that dried up.
Now I wait tables,
clean toilets.
Anything I can
to make the rent.
I'm a walking cliché.
Yeah, well, listen,
l... I can help you.
I can get you
auditions.
How can you
get me auditions?
You're not an agent.
You're a publicist.
Of course I'm a publicist,
but I have contacts.
I know agents.
I can get you an audition.
Caller: Really?
Yeah.
Caller: Wow. There is someone
I'd like you to call.
Name it.
Try the number
you dialed
when you first got
into the booth.
I don't know what you're
talking about, pal.
No? Lucky you, then,
because I wrote it down.
I can see every number
you pressed.
Let's see if Pam
is still at work.
No!
Then I guess
I'll have to do it.
Look, don't!
Too late.
It's already ringing.
I'll put her on speaker
so you can hear.
You're fucking kidding me.
Stu, I never kid.
Hello?
Caller:
Well, hello, Pam.
Hi, who's this?
Caller: It's a good friend of Stu's,
and he hasn't got many.
You know Stu?
Caller: I know he lies.
Who is this?
Don't worry about that.
Stu's listening in.
He can hear what
we're saying about him.
Stu, is that true?
Are you there?
Stu: Look, Pam, just hang up
the goddamn phone.
Caller:
She can't hear you, Stu.
Pam, I'm afraid Stu
hasn't been totally
honest with you.
What do you mean?
Stu: Don't fucking do this.
Caller: Stu has been
lying to you.
Stu: Pam, hang up.
Caller: Now, why would a man
who has a cell phone
call you every day
from a phone booth?
Because
he said it's quiet.
Caller: Pam, that's just stupid.
It's because his wife
checks his cell phone bills.
No record of
his calls to you.
Stu: Jesus Christ.
He said
he wasn't married.
Caller: Oh, he's married.
Her name is Kelly.
I've never seen her,
but she sounds lovely.
Why do you think
he invites you
to the City Hotel?
Cheap rooms
for cheap girls.
Stu: He's a
fucking asshole.
Caller: He's telling you all this
so you'll sleep with him.
Stu: Look, he's lying, Pam.
Don't listen.
Pam: I know that, okay?
I may
be from Montana,
but we have men
there also.
And l... I wasn't planning
on sleeping with him.
I just don't know
a lot of people
right here right now,
and he's cute,
and he said that
he would help me.
Caller: Pamela, he's
never made anyone a star.
Good-bye now. Big kiss.
Hello?
You done in there,
daddy?
Caller: Back to you again, Stu.
Gotta hit
this trick back
"fore the next bitch
take my score.
- Go away.
- Go away?
Hang up the fucking
phone, nigga.
This motherfucker.
You don't
eyeball me, bitch.
Why are you
doing this?
Huh? Did I ever harm you?
Did I ever...
Caller: Now,
let's call Kelly.
She's not home.
Caller: Oh, but I'm sure she's
at the shop on Columbus.
How the fuck do you know
all this shit about us?
Caller: Speed-dial her.
Press auto one.
That's her button.
And what am I
supposed to say?
Why don't you try
telling her the truth...
You're cheating?
I'm not cheating on Kelly.
I never have.
Then what do you
call it?
Look, you're a guy.
Sometimes you just
want to know
it's a possibility,
all right?
You know, it's like
having a beautiful home,
but you still dream of that
quick vacation now and then.
You know, some nice
hotel room with a great view.
You know, maybe a pool.
But it's just a fantasy
because you'll never
really leave home.
Do you hear
what I'm saying?
Kelly is a home
and Pam is a motel.
I'm sure they'll both
appreciate that.
Oh, fuck you!
Caller: Hey, that kind of
language is uncalled for.
Come on, man!
You can't take up
the whole fucking booth!
This here's about business.
Look, this is not
the only phone in New York.
This ain't no...
It's the only one
on Eighth Avenue
that's working now.
Bullshit! Go in a restaurant
or someplace, but get lost!
Motherfucker,
this is my phone!
Get... Goddamn it,
man!
You done made me
hurt my dick hand.
Oh, I'm sure
you're just as good
with the other hand.
Yeah, go away.
I will be back, Motherfucker.
I will be back, bitch!
Get out of my way!
Caller: I was worried
there for you, Stu.
I thought she was
gonna put an eye out
with that... that hand.
Stu: Look,
whoever you are,
you're obviously
a very intelligent man.
And I know what stress
does to you.
It's all I can do from
going crazy myself sometimes.
Caller: You're calling me crazy?
Stu: No. What I'm saying is
you're going through
a difficult time.
Please don't call my wife.
Look, let me give you
my office number.
Come in, we'll talk.
I know a reasonable
photographer
who'll do some
head shots.
Caller: Stu, do you really think
that I'm an actor?
I'm not an actor.
I have no use
for you, Stu, none.
I would just like you
to tell Kelly
the truth
about yourself.
So, are you going
to call Kelly
and tell her about Pam,
or do I have to?
No! Jesus, no.
I'm doing it.
Feeling kind of
nervous, Stu?
Hello?
Caller: Hold it close
to the receiver
so I can hear.
- Stu?
- Yeah.
Where are you?
I'm in a phone booth.
Baby, I just got
this call from this guy
who said you'd be
calling me from a booth
to tell me
something important.
There's a lot of
prank calling
going on today, baby.
Caller: Tell her you call women
from your little phone booth...
Stu: Shut up!
Caller: And invite them to drinks
at discreet hotels.
Stu: Look, I'm not talking
to you, baby.
Come on!
Caller:
Someone's got company.
Get the fuck off
our phone!
Kelly: Honey, who is
that woman?
First Hooker: Oh, the bitch
got a cell phone.
Just some hookers
trying to use the phone.
He just called me
a hooker.
Kelly: Hookers?
First Hooker: Hookers?
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
Kelly: Stu, are you sure
there's
nothing wrong?
First Hooker: We are escorts.
Escorts.
Caller: Tell her you want
to sleep with other women.
Stu: Look, Kelly,
there is this person
and he's saying things
about me, all right,
things that might not
be true.
And if he calls you...
Look, get the fuck
out of here...
Caller:
Repeat after me...
Honey, I want to sleep
with other women.
Look, Kelly,
whatever he says,
don't believe him.
I haven't done anything,
all right?
I haven't done anything.
Only because Pam
had to rehearse
with her scene partner.
Shut the fuck up!
Stu, I don't know what
you're talking about.
But you're scaring me.
Look, I'm sorry, baby.
Can you come over
to the store
so we can talk
in person?
L... I feel
kinda weird.
Yeah. Look, I'll try,
don't worry.
Come on!
First Hooker:
Yeah, bitch!
Kelly: I love you.
Yeah, love you, too.
Caller: I love you.
Get the fuck out of here
before I call Hillary
and have you deported
toJersey, okay?
You know what?
You're a fucking asshole!
Yeah, and you're
a dirty skank.
What are you gonna
do about it?
Ooh, you motherfucker!
Fuck you!
Your mama is
the skank, bitch!
Caller: You didn't tell
your wife the truth,
did you, Stu?
And you can tell
she really loves you.
Must be nice to have
a pretty girl care for you.
Look, why screw up
her life?
She never did you
any harm.
Everybody does harm.
Stu: Look, that's it.
This mind-fuck is over.
Stu, if you hang up,
I will kill you.
Stu: What are you gonna do
about it
up in your fucking
high window
with your goddamn
binoculars?
Caller: I never said
I had binoculars.
I have a highly-magnified
telescopic image of you.
Now what kind of device
has a telescopic sight
mounted on it?
What, you mean...
like a rifle?
Caller: A.30 caliber
bolt-action 700
with a carbon-one
modification
and a state-of-the-art
Hensoldt tactical scope.
And it's staring
straight at you.
Stu: Yeah? How's
my fucking hair?
At this range,
the exit wound
ought to be about the size
of a small tangerine.
Nice try, pal.
Go to hell.
Now...
doesn't that just
torque your jaws?
I love that.
You know,
like in the movies,
just as the good guy is
about to kill the bad guy,
he cocks his gun.
Now why didn't he
have it cocked?
Because that sound
is scary.
It's cool, isn't it?
Look, you shoot a gun here
and there'll be
pandemonium.
All right, do you hear me?
There'll be cops swarming
all over this block.
You think so?
Let's see.
That won't help you.
Oh, Stu,
look at everybody.
Look at all of the people
screaming, Stu.
Here come the cops.
Sniper on the roof.
Gunfire. Hit the deck.
Stu, you still with me?
Stand up and be a man.
Stu: So, what are you...
You mean you'd whack me
for no particular reason?
Caller: Oh, I have
plenty of reasons,
and you keep
giving me more.
Shall I take care
of him?
No! Shit no.
Caller: It would be so easy.
Stu, you just gave
that gentleman
$10 to walk away.
You saved his life.
You do have
a sensitive side.
How much to let me go?
Caller: Let's see how sensitive
you really are.
I'm aiming at you
right now.
Can you feel it...
the heat of it?
Come now, Stu,
you can feel it.
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
Take a look at
where I'm going.
You're doing so much better
than the others.
You read about
the German porn-king
shot 10 days ago,
didn't you,
at 38th and Eighth?
He thought he was an artist
and wouldn't admit that
he was just a pedophile.
Believe me, he had plenty
of chances to come clean.
And of course
you must have read about
the corporate executive
shot in the head
at 47 th and Tenth.
What you probably
didn't read
was that he cashed in
all of his stocks
just before the bottom
fell out
while all the little guys
lost everything.
Now, if he had been
willing to make amends,
share the money, things
might have been different.
Please, tell me,
where am I aiming now?
Below the shoulder.
Which one?
The right shoulder.
Love to love you,
too, baby!
That's phenomenal, Stu.
You're doing so much better
than the others.
What do you remember
about those killings, Stu?
L... I don't know.
Well, you think of yourself
as a smart guy, Stu. Try.
Look, they got shot.
I don't fucking
know, all right?
Caller: Okay, I'll give you a hint.
Wallets, watches...
Everything was left
on their bodies.
"Cause they weren't robberies.
They were executions.
Caller: They didn't have to be.
What did I do
to deserve this?
Huh? Why me?
If you have to ask,
then you're not ready
to know yet.
Second Hooker:
Never let us use the phone.
First Hooker:
Right here. Shit.
- Jesus.
- Yo, in the booth.
Now what?
You got any idea
how much a pain in the ass
you're making my life?
Hey, look at me.
Look, I hear you!
Look me in the eye.
Hang up the phone
and walk away.
Caller: Don't do it.
L... I got my own problems.
I'm your
fucking problem.
You know why I'm
your fucking problem?
My girls keep running
"cross the street,
yapping at me, "Leon, he
won't share the phone.
"Leon, he's
tying up the phone.
"Leon, he told us
to fuck off.
"Leon, we're gonna
make you nuts
"unless you get
over there,
make him get off
the fucking phone."
All right? I'm trying to run
a fucking business here.
I absolutely sympathize,
but I can't get off the call.
You don't understand me,
all right?
I got the G-string Union
over here.
They're breaking
my fucking balls.
I gotta live
with their shit,
but I ain't gonna
put up with yours.
So I'm saying this
once nice, all right?
Hang up the phone.
Walk away.
Caller: He did say it
nicely.
Got cell phone up in there,
too, precious daddy.
Yeah, like he even
need a phone!
Look, I can't get off
the call, all right?
Hey, shut the fuck up.
You hear that shit?
It's like nails
on a chalkboard,
and they ain't gonna
fucking stop
till I get
their fucking way.
I'm... I'm getting
a fucking headache, pal.
All right, look...
Look, all right!
I'll pay you to go away.
How's that?
I don't want
your fucking money.
I want you to
hang up the phone
and get the fuck
out of here.
$120. It's all yours.
Caller: Everybody has
their price, right, Stu?
You're gonna
give me $120
to rent the phone booth
the bums piss in
every fucking night?
I'm... I'm a nice guy.
Something ain't
right with him.
Look at all that
sweat pourin' off
that son of a bitch.
Just one sick mother
we have started with
right here.
Second Hooker: It's
probably catchin', too.
Leon: Yo, yo, yo.
He got the Al DS.
How long you want
to rent the booth?
Stu: Indefinitely.
Indefinitely?
What do I look like,
a fucking asshole?
Let me tell you something.
Hey! $500 gets you
indefinitely.
Wait up!
Hold the fuck up!
How come he
defyin' you, huh?
What, you got
bitch in you now?
Let me know!
I said shut the fuck up!
Yeah, now talk to him
like that!
Come on,
get the fuck out!
Jesus Christ...
Are you enjoying this?
Caller: Do you need help?
Look, I'm handling it.
Come on!
I can help you, Stu.
I wasn't gonna
kill you before,
but you just changed
my fucking mind.
I'd take off
if I was you.
He gonna
kick your ass.
- Uh-huh.
-
@@ He gonna
kick your ass @@
@@ He gonna
kick your ass @@
Will you get the fuck
out of here?
Will you go away,
please?
Caller:
He looks very angry.
Aw, come on...
Hey, look.
Caller: Get rid of him.
Hang up
the fucking phone.
Look, we can work this out.
Caller, annoyed:
Get rid of him!
Hang up
the fucking phone.
I got a watch.
It's a Solaris.
$2,000 retail.
Yeah? I got a fucking
gold rolex, Motherfucker.
You got 5 seconds to
get off the fucking phone.
Caller: Batter up.
4...
I can stop him.
just say the word, Stu.
No, don't... don't!
Oh, fuck.
Caller: This will count
as a hang up.
I can make him stop.
Just say the word.
Can you hear me?
Stu, Muffled: Yes.
- What?
- Yes!
Who runnin' this?
Whose street is this?
Oh, my God.
Baby, you bleedin'.
You must've cut yourself...
Second Hooker:
What's wrong? What's wrong?
- Baby? Leon?
-
- Leon?
- Unh.
He was fucking shot!
Oh, my God!
Motherfucker!
Somebody call
an ambulance!
Call 411!
First Hooker: Yo,
he ain't breathing.
Call the meat wagon!
Second Hooker:
Shut the fuck up!
You shot him.
Why'd you fucking
shoot him?
- Caller: You said yes.
- L...
That was "Yes,
I can hear you"
not "Yes, kill him,"
motherfucker.
Caller: You ought to be more careful
with what you say.
Oh, my God.
Motherfucker, why?
It wasn't me!
Where's the gun?
Do you see a gun?
Fuck you!
You pumped one
into him!
Hey, I saw it!
He's got a Glock!
Get down!
Get the fuck down!
Daddy got a Glock!
What Glock?!
I don't have a fucking Glock!
It's a telephone!
You shot my man,
Daddy!
Yo, come on, he'll
fucking shoot your ass!
You shot my baby,
Daddy!
Mr. Motherfucker.
Mr. Motherfucker!
Bitch, come on!
Get in here, bitch!
First Hooker:
Better run, Motherfucker!
The cops is comin',
and I hope they gun
your ass down!
I'm not going
anywhere, am I?
Caller: If only you had
dealt with the man decently,
this might not have
been necessary.
Look, I offered him money.
I offered him my watch.
Caller: But not your respect,
which is what he
really wanted.
You were dismissive
like you dismissed
the nice pizza guy.
Stu: Fuck.
Caller: You are guilty
of inhumanity
to your fellow man.
Look, I'm not guilty
of a goddamn thing...
Oh, take responsibility
for what you've done, Stu.
Be a man.
Oh, I love this
fucking spin.
You shoot the guy and
I'm fucking responsible?
Well, looked that way
from up here.
I don't know what
I ever did to you,
but whatever it was,
I'm glad.
All right? I wish
it'd have been worse.
I wish you'd
fucking died!
Yes! Finally some honesty.
Just tell me
who you are.
No one you'd ever notice.
I don't run in your circles.
Yeah, and what is it
you do?
Caller: I watch.
You watch?
Caller: Yes, well, what else
is there to do
when life turns on you
and you've retreated
into some small room?
You look out your window.
You see people
come in and out
of this phone booth,
the same ones every day.
You make up names for them.
You imagine their stories.
But eventually
you get tired of imagining
and one day you follow
one of them.
And you hear
all of his lies,
and you decide that his sin
should be punished.
Some guy shouting
into his cell phone
full of self-importance
isn't gonna notice me,
but I noticed
that German porn-king,
and I noticed that
corrupt executive.
And I noticed you, Stu.
I'm flattered.
Police Operator 553,
what is your emergency?
Will you please respond?
Stu: Look, what was
so interesting
about a guy
in a phone booth
on 53rd and Eighth?
Caller: The Stu Show.
Better than TV.
Look, how'd I get
so lucky to be picked up
by a killer
with a rifle?
Operator: Are you in need...
Caller: You had it made.
Kelly at home.
Pam on the side.
I saw Pam once.
I followed her
to a restaurant.
Lovely.
Life has given you
more than your
fair share, Stu,
but it appears
you don't appreciate it.
Look, look, look,
listen.
Appearances can be
deceiving.
I mean, I may
look confident,
but I'm really
actually
just crying out
for help!
Help! You know?
I'm trying to help you, Stu,
but you won't help yourself.
Ah! Fuck!
What's the matter, Stu?
You shot me.
It's time you learn, Stu.
Deception can't go
unrewarded.
Stu: Deception?
What fucking deception?
Caller: "Are you in need
of immediate
police or medical
response?"
Shit. You bugged
the fucking booth.
That's how you knew.
That's how you knew
about Pam and me.
Caller: You picked the wrong
person to lie to.
Look, I didn't pick you.
Caller: Right. It must have been
your flashy suit
that attracted me.
I get fucked on account
of my clothes?
Huh? That why you
killed Leon?
I didn't kill Leon because
of the way he was dressed.
Yeah, and those other
Did they dress too nice?
You must feel
really expensive
when you
walk out the door.
Stu: Look,
here come the cops.
What are you gonna do?
Go out
in a blaze of glory,
or are you gonna run?
Caller: No, I'm not a coward
like some people I know.
Stu: Look, you can get away
if you run now.
Caller: I suppose you'll
blame me for Leon.
Stu: No, no, no, I'll
confess I shot him
with my fucking phone.
Caller: Well, then I urge you
to keep one thing
in mind, Stu.
Take a look
at your chest.
You saw how accurate
I can be, how lethal.
Stu: You kill me now, and you
give yourself away.
Caller: Not with a silencer.
It would take these guys
the rest of the day
to figure out it wasn't
one of their own men
that did it.
You know you can be
shot 41 times
for just pulling out
your wallet.
You in the booth,
throw down your weapon
and come out
with your hands raised.
Caller: Ignore him.
W-What if
they open fire?
They won't.
Look around you, Stu.
Do you see the tourists
with the video cameras?
The ones just hoping
the cops will blow you away
so they can sell the tape
to the most gory
police shootouts?
Don't worry,
they'll keep the police
on their best behavior.
So long as you don't take
what would be interpreted
as a hostile action,
you should be safe.
Safe?
You call this safe?
I got a whole fucking
precinct here
with guns
pointed my way.
Sergeant:
With both hands raised,
moving slowly,
step out of the booth.
If we see
any signs of a weapon,
we will respond.
You won't because
there isn't any!
Put down the phone
and raise your hand!
Look, I can't.
I'm on
an important call.
Verify this
information for me.
The guy in the booth
shot that guy over there
and stuck around
to make a phone call...
Is that correct?
Yeah, yeah, that's what
the hookers are saying.
All right,
give me the horn.
Sir!
I'm ordering you
to fully comply.
Look, I'm busy.
All right?
Come back later.
Caller, Laughing:
Very good, Stu.
Officer: Step out
of the booth
and raise your hands.
I am giving you
an order.
Caller: I give the orders
here, Stu, don't I?
This guy's
looking for us
to kill him,
Captain.
Suicide by a cop?
That's not gonna happen.
Get that body
out of here fast.
Yo, somebody
get the body.
Tell the ambulance
to get the body.
Caller: Thousands of people
die every day,
but you put one dead body
in the middle
of a busy street,
and it makes people crazy.
Look at these guys.
You can smell the fear.
Fuck. 10 cops.
Caller: This reminds me of 'Nam.
Vietnam?
Yes, Vietnam.
I was too young
to go,
but I've seen
pictures.
Well, pictures
can't do it, Stu.
You can't imagine
the fear, the stench,
pigs eating
Napalm-charred bodies,
children leaving grenades
in your boots.
And you got blamed
for the war.
I came home,
and people spit on me.
This country
owes you an apology.
Look, I just had this
vision of you, of a kid,
coming back
from the war, you know?
Inured to the killing,
not able to get work,
isolated.
I think that
could be made into
a pretty affecting story
and, you know, one that
everyone understands.
And I think cops...
I think they're on
the side of vets.
You are pathetic, Stu.
Why don't you wake up?
Napalm-charred bodies?
I'd have to be 50
to be in that war!
Look, stop fucking
with my head, please.
Cover me. I'm going
to go talk to him.
Shouldn't we wait on
the E.S.U. Negotiator?
They could take
I'm not gonna take
a chance on this one.
I'm not.
I'm gonna handle this.
Sir! I'm taking out
my weapon.
Putting my weapon
down on the car.
Officer: The captain's going in.
I'm not armed.
Yeah, neither am I.
My name is Ramey.
Captain Ed Ramey.
What's yours?
Look, I don't want
to be friends.
I don't know,
it looks like you could
use a friend right now.
Caller: Tell him you've
already got a friend.
I already
got a friend, okay?
Is that who you're
talking to on the phone?
Look, I just want to hear
your side of it.
That's all.
I ain't got
no side of it.
And I didn't
shoot anybody.
You see a fucking
gun anywhere? Look.
Felicia: It's in
your back pocket!
I see it!
He been feeling it!
Sir, do you have
the weapon in your pocket?
No. I got a cell phone,
and I got cigarettes.
I got no fucking weapon.
Okay. Then what
are you doing
in a phone booth
making calls?
Look, you want
to see it? Here...
Hey! Don't reach
for that!
- Hold your fire!
- Jesus.
I don't need
to see it.
I already know
it's there.
I got plenty
of witnesses over here
who saw you use it.
Look, they didn't see it
because it didn't happen!
Shut them up!
He's dead,
but it didn't happen.
Then who did it?
Caller:
Mustn't tell him, Stu.
I don't know.
Hey, you were
the closest one to him.
You must've saw it happen.
Come on,
help me out here.
Caller: This guy is
getting on my nerves.
Look, stay the fuck
out of this.
Who do you keep
talking to on the phone?
Nobody.
Your friend, your parent,
your lover... who?
Caller: Careful, Stuart, careful.
My psychiatrist.
Excellent.
I should have
thought of that.
I see. What's this
doctor's name?
It would be really helpful
to us if we knew that.
He says
not to tell you.
It's privileged
information.
Very good, Stuart.
See, now you're having fun.
Yeah, whatever
you fucking say.
Ramey: I respect your
right to privacy.
I've been through
therapy myself.
The department...
they provided it for me.
I know it's not good form
for a cop to be saying that,
but you know, sometimes,
hey, the circumstances...
Stress... I had issues.
I lost my marriage
over it.
Caller: Tell him not to come
any closer.
Stu: Look, don't come
any closer.
Stop right there.
Go back a few steps.
Go back
to where you were.
Okay, okay.
Hey, no problem.
So you got some
intimacy issues.
I got those, too.
All I want to know is,
what happened, man?
Caller: Tell him to read you
your rights.
I want you to
read me my rights.
And stop asking
questions.
You have the right
to remain silent.
You have the right
to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one,
an attorney will be
provided for you.
All right?
So now, can you at least
give me your first name?
Just your first name.
Caller: Don't tell him.
It's my right not to
have any first name.
Ramey: No gun, no name.
Stu: That's right.
You're a highly
underprivileged person, sir.
Caller: Demand your lawyer.
And go get
my lawyer, too.
I want an attorney
brought down here
to negotiate
my surrender.
Caller: Just brilliant, Stu.
I understand that,
but, uh,
it's gonna be
very difficult
to get a lawyer
to come down here
and risk his life,
but once you
hand over the gun...
How can I hand over
the fucking weapon when
you won't let me put
my hand in my pocket?
Oh, no, we'll
take it out for you.
All you have to do is just
step out of the booth
with your hands raised...
nothing will happen to you.
It's not gonna work.
Caller: Stu, Stu, please.
What?
Ask him a question for me.
Ask him if his wife got
tired of sleeping with him?
I, uh... fuck.
I can't do that.
Oh, sure you can, Stu.
Ask him if
he couldn't get it up,
if he couldn't
satisfy her.
Sir, are you going
to step out of the booth?
- I can't... No.
- Ramey: Is that a "no"?
You're not stepping out
of the booth?
Caller: Ask him.
Is that a "no"?
Caller: Ask him!
Both your lives
depend on it.
Sir?
Captain, you, uh,
you couldn't satisfy
your wife sexually?
Excuse me?
Caller: Ask him if he abuses himself
now that she's gone.
Does he masturbate
on those lonely nights?
For God's sake!
Caller: Say it!
Say it or I will
blow him away!
So do you
wack off now?
Hey!
I'm going to see about
that lawyer for you, okay?
Yes.
Just relax.
Caller: Stu, I think
you hurt his feelings.
I want to know who he's
on that phone with.
I want a techie here.
I need to talk to somebody
about that phone.
Caller: Do you think we went
too far, Stuart?
Should we
give ourselves up?
You know,
maybe I'd like someone
to negotiate
my surrender, too.
Look, I'm sure we
can work that out.
Well, I don't want to just
spill my guts to anyone.
Could you get me
national news?
I mean, you've got
connections, right?
Sure.
Larry King? Could you get
Larry King down here?
Larry... why the fuck
would Larry King
come down here?
Because you're friends.
Who else
could you get, huh?
Could you get
Tom Brokaw?
How 'bout Dan Rather?
Diane Sawyer?
Look, l... I don't know.
They're busy.
"I... I... I... busy."
How 'bout Mike Wallace,
Ted Koppel?
PeterJennings,
Katie Couric,
Al Roker, anybody?
Nah! Nobody.
Face it, Stu,
you're small-time,
and you've got
a credibility problem.
Listen,
don't fucking worry
about my credibility,
all right?
What about yours?
Look, it's our friends
from channels 2 and 5.
You're local news,
Stuart.
You could never do this
for any of your clients,
not if your life
depended on it,
but me,
I've made you famous.
Stick your head out
a little
so they can get
a better angle on you.
They're here
for coverage of me
dying in the gutter.
Caller: How ungrateful.
Those cameras
will make the police
very careful, Stuart,
so come on,
smile a little for them.
Can you tap into
that phone call?
Should be no problem.
Except we'll need
a warrant
if he's on the line
with his shrink.
Fuck that, I'm not
gonna jeopardize this
on a technicality.
Look, tracing...
That's not
a violation, right?
As long as we
don't listen in.
Okay, this is what
I want you to do.
I want you to find out
who he's talking to
and their current
location.
All right.
We get that,
I want somebody
to get over there
and find out what
the hell is going on.
Caller: Look across the street
and see what everybody
in New York is looking at.
You're the man, Stuart.
You're the center
of attention.
Wait till this
goes national.
ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN...
You're gonna hit
the whole alphabet, Stu.
Listen, I'll be
forgotten about
in a week.
No one ever remembers
the name of the victims.
It's the killers
that get the cover
of  magazine.
All right?
Think about it.
You'd be famous.
Ted Bundy,
john Wayne Gacy,
fucking Jeffrey Dahmer.
Name a victim.
You can't.
And anyway,
I don't deserve to be
the center of attention.
It ought to be you
they're covering.
No, all that attention
would embarrass me.
I know exactly the spin
to put on this.
How your terror inspires
your creativity?
This could be
a media frenzy.
All right, you'd get
Barbara Walters,
Larry King... if you
still wanted him.
See, that approach
seems predicated
upon me surrendering myself
without killing you.
No.
Listen, we can
make you sympathetic.
Sit down with a writer,
bang out a book.
You know,
movie of the week.
Get America
on your side.
Right, you killed Leon
because he was gonna
kill me.
You killed Leon
to protect me.
All right? Now,
in a city where nobody
looks out for anybody,
you took a stand.
I'm your best witness
to that.
So you want me to trust you
to get me out of this?
Y-Yes, I do.
I want you to trust me.
Trust me.
Stu, you must think
I'm crazy.
Oh, shit.
Here comes Braman.
I'll take care
of him.
Hey, you should've
waited for me
to initiate contact
with the suspect.
I already established
some rapport with him.
I'll let you know
if I need any help, okay?
What, are you grandstanding
for these TV cameras?
You want to leave this
to a professional.
Until a professional
gets here,
I'll handle it.
You're a funny guy.
All right.
You get
somebody else killed,
it's on your head.
Got it?
Hey, look, this is what
I want to do, okay?
This is the City Hotel
right here.
I want to put 3 guys
in the lobby over here.
And give me
Okay? See if you can get me
What the fuck?
Caller: Not going
to answer it?
I can't.
I reach for the phone,
the cops will think
it's a gun.
Hmm, I'll bet
it's Kelly.
She's probably
heard what you did,
she's sick with worry.
And I'm not gonna make her
feel any better, am I?
Well, you could ask her
to forgive you, Stuart.
You could confess your sins
and beg for absolution.
Come clean.
Stuart, you're
in this position
because you're not
telling the truth.
I'm in this fucking position
because you've got a gun.
No. Stuart, that is
the sin of spin.
Avoidance and deception.
You are being
given a chance here
to make things right.
Now, talk to her.
Look, I can't.
Please.
I am telling you
to answer that phone.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Ma'am, you can't cross
in front of here!
Caller: Answer it!
Stu: Look, I can't.
Please.
Caller: Don't make me hurt you!
Talk to your wife!
It's not her
calling.
How can you be so sure?
It's you.
It's you,
you miserable fuck!
Damn, you got me.
You continue to impress.
Yeah,
you could shoot me,
but you want them
to do it.
Yes, well,
that's an option.
Captain, this lady says
the perp's her husband.
Here's her I.D.
I couldn't believe
it when I saw this.
Who do you think he's talking to
on the phone right there?
L... I don't know.
I spoke to him
earlier today,
and, um, I told him
that there was a man
who called me.
A man?
Did this upset him,
that you were
talking to other men?
Yes, he did seem
a little upset,
but, no,
it's not like that.
I didn't even know
who this guy was.
Who's his psychiatrist?
He doesn't have one.
That you know of.
I've been with him
for 3 years,
married for one.
I think I'd know if
he was in therapy.
I wish to God
he had been.
I saw somebody
after my divorce.
It kept me from
picking up a gun,
doing something I probably
would've regretted.
Look, Stu didn't
kill anyone.
Ma'am,
under the circumstances,
you need to consider
whether your husband
is exactly who
you thought he was,
because according
to these witnesses
right over here,
he has a gun,
he has used that gun,
and let's pray to God
that he doesn't use it again.
Captain.
If you can think
of any disputes
he's having currently,
please tell me.
Emergency Service Cop: We're clearing
the first floor of the City Hotel.
I can stage an assault unit
within 10 feet of the booth.
We've also got sharpshooters
securing rooftop positions.
Okay, let me know when
you're in position.
Absolutely.
What about that wire tap?
We got something on that?
No. We're working on it
right now.
Just gotta hold tight
a while, all right?
Yeah, no problem.
No problem.
Mrs. Shepard.
Mrs. Shepard.
Everyth...
Does he like being
called Stuart or Stu?
No, Stu.
Call him Stu.
Stu, okay.
Come with me, please.
Stu!
I have your wife here
with me.
Caller: So that's how you knew
she wasn't calling.
You deceived me.
Kelly: Stu!
She's not my wife.
Are you okay?!
Can you
just talk to me?
Caller: Yes, talk to her, Stu.
Look, she's not
my wife.
All right? She's some
fucked-up failed actress
I wouldn't handle.
She's stalking me!
You're not making this up.
You are his wife, right?
Yes, here's a photograph
of us together.
I don't know what
he's talking about.
Stu, listen
to your wife.
She only wants
what's best for you.
Look,
she's not my wife!
Stu, nobody
wants to hurt you.
We just... We just want
to know what happened.
Yeah, very good.
Go home,
you fuckin' lunatic.
You hear me?! Go!
Please don't
make things worse.
Just come out.
Do what they
tell you to do!
Caller: So your wife is a crazy
actress stalker
and you don't know her.
That's an interesting marriage.
Look, get her
out of here, all right?!
That's it.
That's enough.
I don't want to
agitate this.
Are you guys having
some marital problems?
Braman: Come on! Get the woman
out of here.
Kelly: No! I don't know
what's going on.
He's... He's bleeding.
We... We... We're fine.
This morning
everything was fine.
You just stay
right here, all right?
- Stay here, okay?
- Okay.
I think
she did some good.
You got a number where
that lawyer could be found at?
No, we don't have
a lawyer.
He specifically asked
for his lawyer
to come down here to
negotiate his surrender.
Well,
we never needed one.
Well, you need
a good one now.
Look, you'll do me best
by staying near here, okay?
Okay.
I'm gonna get your husband
out alive, all right?
I'm not gonna let you
fuck this up
with this amateur-hour
bullshit!
Get Mrs. Shepard
out of here.
You know, get her some coffee
or something like that.
You're gonna lose
this guy, too.
You need
some kind of redemption,
do it on the couch.
What are you seeing
a shrink for anyway, huh?!
Get the fuck out of here!
Don't fuckin' touch me!
I'm not steppin' down
for you.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Caller: You'd think she didn't know
she was being watched.
What?!
But beautiful women
always know.
You talking about Kelly?
Caller: That false, indifferent,
superior air,
it's just a tease.
They want eyes on them.
Why does she
put on her makeup,
do her hair,
dress so nicely?
Not for her husband
that she hardly ever sees.
No, it's for somebody else
to notice.
I noticed.
What the fuck
are you doing?
You stay away from her.
Leave her alone!
I'm giving her
what she wants.
I'll bet you've never
looked at Kelly
the way I am right now.
Don't you dare
fuckin' hurt her.
Don't I dare?!
I'm not the one who has
hurt her, Stuart.
What they can't know
is what we do to them
in our minds, right?
You sick fuck.
Perfect violation.
Look, leave her
out of this.
How many times have you
had sex with Pam
in that hotel bedroom...
in your head?
Would you really miss Kelly
if she was gone?
That's it.
Not another word.
I'm not
talkin' to you.
Your choices put other people
in jeopardy, Stuart.
When are you
gonna learn that?
This is funny.
Stuart, look uptown.
These geniuses are still
at the juncture box
trying to tap in.
Only I have installed
an encryption device
at both ends of the line.
There's no chance
of a trap trace,
so now they've got to try
some fancy LoJack instrument.
It's really sad.
I hope you weren't pinning
your hopes on those morons.
Truth is, I'm on a wireless
A.D.S. With a cloned number.
It'll take them at least
a half an hour to find out
that I've call-forwarded it
through Philadelphia.
And let me tell you,
this will all be over
before they can get
a dial tone.
We can't get a trace
or break
into the line.
It's like a ball
of rubber bands.
I knew there was
somethin' weird about this.
You guys keep
workin' on it.
Caller: Stu?
Stuart, come on.
You're behaving
like a child.
Still gonna give me
the silent treatment? Hello.
Stuart, don't do this,
please.
Come on. My sainted mother
used to do this.
She used to dish this out.
Stuart,
please don't do this.
Stuart, you're bringing back
my unhappy childhood!
Stuart,
talk to me, please!
Talk to me!
I can't take it, Stu!
Please! Aah...
Ha ha ha!
I'm kiddin'.
I had a very happy
childhood.
Hey...
There's our girl again.
I wasn't planning
on killing her,
but plans change.
Just tell me what
the fuck you want from me.
Anything you want.
Oh. Hello.
There you are.
I thought I was talkin'
to myself again.
Anything you want,
I'll do it. Just tell me.
Tell Kelly
about the real Stu,
about your little motel.
And then
you'll let us go?
Why not?
Kelly?!
That's a start.
Baby?
- Ramey: Hold her back!
- Officer: Hey!
I want you
to talk to me!
- Ramey: Keep her back!
- Yes?
- Keep her back!
- Grab her!
I'm listening!
Kelly, I called
some woman.
Caller: Every... day.
Every day. L... I was attracted
to this other woman.
I called her, and...
Caller: I wanted
to fuck her.
And I wanted
to sleep with her.
No...
I wanted...
to fuck... her.
Say it.
Say it!
And I wanted
to fuck her.
I'm sorry.
Whatever you did...
I don't care.
Please... just...
come out
of the booth. Okay?
That's all I did.
That's all I did.
I'm sorry.
All right, look, l... I've
done what you asked.
That's it. I've had
enough of this game.
haven't.
You said
you'd let us go.
I changed my mind.
You miserable fuck.
You can't do this!
You can't do this to me!
Look, I took
all your shit!
I did everything
you fuckin' asked!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You lied to me. Now
I'm done with this game.
I've fuckin' had enough.
You go fuck yourself.
- Later.
- Ha ha ha...
He hung up.
Maybe they already
got a trace.
E.S.U.
E.S.U.
I'm givin'
myself up!
- First the gun!
- Heads up!
I want to see you
toss away your weapon!
Throw the weapon
outside the booth!
You stay
where you are!
Hey! First...
Don't hurt him!
Please don't hurt him!
There is
no fucking gun!
You stay right
where you are!
I want you to turn
around, interlock
your fingers
behind your head.
-
- Okay?
Please! Give them
the gun!
Kelly, no!
Get back!
Kelly!
Hey!
Back her up!
Freeze!
Get back!
Get back!
Baby!
Ramey: Freeze!
I gotta answer it.
Freeze!
Don't move.
-
- Hold your fire!
Ramey:
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire.
Hold. Hold.
Go ahead.
Answer it.
Whoa, whoa! What
the fuck are you doin'?!
He's comin' out!
Answer the phone.
Stu: You fuckin' coward.
Caller: Hi, Stu.
Now... you've had
your little tantrum.
And you said
some things in anger
that I am willing
to forget.
Get her back
in the car!
You're acting like he's
not the fuckin' perp.
If he's not the shooter,
who the fuck is, huh?!
Captain, what
the fuck is up
with the phone
calls, man?
Caller:
So, can we start over?
You lied.
Caller: Well, you can't know
the pain of betrayal
until you've been
betrayed.
Sniper up in one
of these buildings,
so I want you to
talk to E.S.U.
I want you to get one of
these guys over here...
This building.
Start looking up here from
window to window to window
until you find
the perp, okay?
I want you
to do it quickly.
I want you to do it
quietly. All right?
All right.
Yo, where's
the E.S.U. Sergeant?
You said we could go.
You said
you'd let us go.
Caller: Relax, Stuart.
Nobody gets it right
the first time.
You've done much better
than the others,
and you will get
another chance to end this.
I'm just not finished yet.
Yeah, well, I am.
There's nothing
keeping me here.
You mean
besides the fear of death?
Look, I dive out now,
you got one shot,
and I'm gonna be
fuckin' dancing.
You think
you can get me?
Well, I could go
for some target practice.
One shot, they'll be
looking for you.
A second shot, you'd
give yourself away.
Go on, Stuart.
Hang up.
Trust your fate to
the friendly men in flak jackets
with automatic weapons.
I'm sure you can patch up
that little misunderstanding
about the dead body.
The cops can't prove
I killed anyone.
You had motive.
No weapon.
Plenty of
loud-mouth witnesses.
No gun,
and I walk.
Are you sure?
Yes!
Yeah.
You murder a guy,
and you forget where
you stashed your gun.
Why don't you lift
the plastic ceiling panel
and feel around?
Peekaboo.
What's up next to
the Florescent bulb?
Check it out, Stu.
Cops see me reach
for something,
and they'll
blow me away.
Caller: There's only
one way to find out.
Look, the slugs
from that dead guy,
they came from
your rifle.
They're not gonna
match any handgun.
I've seen enough cop
shows to know that.
Hollow points
fragment on impact, Stuart.
There's nothing to match.
Stu: Only there's no gun
up there.
Caller: Don't take my word for it.
See for yourself.
There are rounds left
in it.
I totally couldn't
give a shit.
Come on, Stuart.
Don't disappoint me!
Use your imagination.
You'd shoot me
if you got the chance,
wouldn't you?
With a big fuckin' smile
on my face.
There's the spirit.
Now, what if I told you
I was just above the theater,
See the pink curtains?
There you go, Stuart.
Yes.
Yoo-hoo.
Yoo-hoo.
Why would you do that?
Because it's fun.
The odds are even now,
Stuart.
Isn't that what you wanted?
You know where I am,
and you have a gun.
If you have it in you,
you can take me down.
Fuck.
They'd kill me
before I got off
a shot, you...
Caller: Aw, you're probably right.
I'm not really there anyway.
You would've just spoiled
some nice lady's curtains.
Looks like someone
watches the news.
Stu: Who?
Caller: The motel.
Oh, God.
I think she could use
a new head shot.
Don't!
Then take down the gun!
But this has nothing
to do with her.
She has everything
to do with this, Stuart.
You're here
because you called her.
She's here
because you called her.
Now, take it down!
Don't make me
hurt Pam, Stuart.
Take down the gun.
Sgt. Cole:
Everybody get ready.
Hold on. Let's just see
what he does, all right?
Let's just see what
he's doing. Hold on.
There's nothing there.
Caller: Nothing
but your fingerprints
on the finest cop-killer
money can buy.
Come on, Stu.
Let's see it.
Fuck, no.
It's staying there.
Fine, then someone will
have to take your place.
Come on, Stu! You're in
a perfect position!
How do you
figure?
You get to choose
between them...
Pamela or Kelly,
or should I choose for you?
One of them
can take your place.
Don't do this!
Stuart,
you've got to be
more in touch
with your feelings.
I thought
you only loved Kelly.
It's true.
But you lie to her.
It... It's complicated.
Then I'll uncomplicate it,
Stuart,
by removing temptation!
I say Pam.
No! Look,
this isn't Pam's fault.
This is all my fault.
She's... She's innocent.
Oh. Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Time's running out.
Okay, Kelly, then.
You decide.
No! Please!
Come on, Stu!
Don't you get the game yet?
You're a selfish guy.
Pick one and save yourself.
You're a selfish guy.
Pick one and save yourself.
Blonde or brunette?
Time's running out.
You or them?
Kelly or Pam?
Kelly or Pam?
Kelly or Pam?
Come on, Stu.
Stop this.
I can't take this
anymore.
What are you doing?
Get up.
I was looking
for my ring.
Get up, Stuart!
L... l...
Stand up and be a man!
You're embarrassing
yourself!
Captain, yeah,
I got it.
The rifleman on
the east side of the street
reports the subject pulled
a small, dark object
out of his pants pocket.
All right. You're
lookin' at a suicide
now on national
fuckin' TV.
You gonna let me take
this over, Captain?
Tell everybody
to hold on, all right?
Tell everybody to
hold their fire.
Everybody hold.
Stay ready, but hold.
Caller: Stuart, you're
beginning to annoy me.
Y-Y-You can't do this.
Caller: Stu, no more spinning,
no more excuses.
Oh, what are you doing?
Look, listen.
Listen,
please listen to me.
Caller: No more delays, Stuart.
L... l... I'm on my knees
begging you not to kill me.
Well, I will if you keep up
this pathetic spectacle.
Hey, look, from up
in your high window,
you could kill anyone
on the street.
Caller: Yes, I know that, Stu.
And, uh...
y-you can pick off
any of the cops like Ramey
with your rifle.
Shut up and stand up!
Look,
why threaten Kelly?
You said you liked
how she sounded
on the phone
at the store.
Please don't hurt her.
Please don't fuckin' hurt
my wife.
This doesn't have to end
with me shooting you,
but you're leaving me
no choice.
Now get up!
Okay, how does this end?
Tell me how this ends.
Caller: The stage is almost set.
People are gonna be
eating dinner
watching you die.
We got a sniper
situation here.
What about that
phone call earlier
to your store?
I got a phone call
this afternoon from somebody.
I think
it was a prank call.
He told me Stu would be
calling me from a phone booth.
How long will it take to
bring up a record
of Mrs. Shepard's
incoming calls?
If he's using
that secure line,
we won't know anything
more than we know now.
Say he didn't.
Let's just assume
that he's human,
makes mistakes
just like all of us.
I need to
get that number.
I've been waiting
for that number.
It was a guy.
He... He sounded like
mid-thirties.
Mrs. Shepard, you know
it would be safer
if you got back
in the car, okay?
Please get back
in the car.
I want you to divert
the incoming
E.S.U. Units
to Broadway and just
hold them there.
You want me to start
clearing the streets?
Yeah, that sounds like
a good idea.
No, no, no.
I don't want the sniper
to be aware
of any of our movements.
He's already
got position on us.
Let's not let him know
we know too much, okay?
I got you.
- Jonah!
- Yeah?
Don't look up.
Give me sharpshooters
looking at those windows.
You got it, Captain.
I'm gonna buy us
some time here.
All right.
Stu, is it okay
if I come out
and talk to you
for a second?
I don't know.
Caller: This guy
is so lonely.
All he wants to do
is talk.
You're walking through
a bad dream,
and you can't wake up.
Caller: Okay, now he's really
testing my patience.
You want to wake up,
Stu?
I want to,
but...
l... l...
I got issues
I can't
talk about.
That your psychiatrist
on the phone, Stu?
Yeah. I, uh, I'm
paying him overtime.
That was pretty brave,
what you did.
Admitting all that stuff
to your wife.
It was liberating, right?
Should've been.
Maybe if I could be
more honest with my wife,
you know, then...
then I don't know,
maybe something would've
turned out different.
Caller: Oh, please.
Trust is the key.
You trust me, Stu?
Caller: Get this man
a seat on
I want to, but
I got, I got...
issues I can't
talk about.
Caller: Yes. Lethal issues.
Tell him to stay back.
Look, don't come
any closer.
Hey, I don't
want to cause
or make anything
harder for you.
Caller: Pam, Ramey, Kelly,
people on the street.
You've got a lot of lives
in your hands, Stu.
Look, I already
told you
this is a private
conversation.
Now, what the fuck
do you want?
I want to let you know
that it's safe
outside the booth.
Caller: No, it's not.
Always get out of the
booth. You can't stay...
I like it
in the fuckin' booth!
All right?
It's my whole world.
Now, this is my booth,
and I'm not coming out
ever, all right? Never!
We're not gonna try
to force you to come out
because then there could be
some kind of miscalculation,
and then I would never
find out why this happened.
Stu...
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid that I'm
gonna be standing by
and my men are gonna
shoot some guy,
and when we find out
what he has in his hand
once we turn over
his dead body
and we see the thing
that he was
threatening people with,
we realize that it was just
a little black bible.
Or a cell phone.
Caller: Don't push me, Stu.
I'm not gonna
let that happen here.
All I wanted to make
was a phone call.
One lousy
phone call.
Caller: That's enough, Stu.
Ramey: You got some bad news
on that call, right?
The worst.
It made you want to
jump off the edge.
I've been falling
ever since.
Caller: I'm gonna
push  over the edge.
Just say the word.
It's time to land, man.
When you hit bottom,
you die.
I'm your safety net.
Caller: Oh,
please say the word.
If I tell you what
you want to know,
you'll die, too.
Caller: Exactly.
I'm going.
Stu: Good.
Look, Stu.
Um, we put a call out
to your lawyer.
Your wife,
she gave us the number.
And I got my best men
working on
bringing him down.
Okay?
Caller: That's it.
The captain gets a bullet.
Go on, get out of here!
D-D-Did you hear
what I said, asshole?
Get out of here!
Go on, now! Go!
Enough of this sideshow,
Stu.
No problem.
Your sins have
finally caught up to you.
Oh, so this is all some
religious thing, huh?
Ah, that would explain it.
Bible-crazed killer picks on
fashion-obsessed P.R. Guy.
Tell me
what you want, then.
What everyone wants...
For the bad guy
to get what he deserves.
Go for the gun.
Kill myself?
Caller: Yes. It would be a rare,
unselfish act.
Uhh.
We got hostile action.
Hey, hey. Nothing is hostile
until I say it is.
L... I can't find it.
Caller: Kelly, Pam...
Bam, bam!
All right, all right. Look.
I found it. I got it.
Then let's see it.
Let everyone see it.
The cops will kill me.
Yes. You're talking
prime-time material now.
All this shit just
to watch me die, huh?
No. To get you to do
what's right.
If you want
to save yourself, confess.
I already told Kelly
everything.
Everything?
No. No more excuses
and half-truths, Stuart.
You look out into those cameras
and you bare your soul.
TV seems to help bring out
the worst in people.
You should be fine.
How those techs doing?
We got anything?
No, not yet.
Not yet.
We haven't found
your lawyer yet, Stu,
but we're
getting close. Okay?
Caller: Stuart,
I'm offering you a chance
to redeem yourself.
Come on, Stu.
Humble yourself
in front of your loved ones
and millions of strangers
and me.
It's do-or-die time.
What, you couldn't find
anyone worse than me?
I'm not, not a murderer
or a child molester
but a publicist
who has fantasies
about pretty
little actresses,
who spends all his money
on Italian suits
and dry-cleaning so people
will think he's important,
who doesn't waste his time
being nice to people
who aren't any use to him.
These are my crimes?
Stuart,
I know your crimes.
Tell them.
I've never done
anything for anybody
who... who couldn't do
something for me!
I string along an eager kid
with promises
that I'll pay him money.
I only keep him around
because he looks up to me.
Adam, if you're watching,
don't be a publicist.
You're too good for it.
I, uh, I lie in person
and on the phone.
I lie to my friends.
I lie to newspapers
and magazines
who, who sell my lies
to more and more people.
L-l-I'm just a part
of a big cycle of lies.
I should be
fuckin' president.
I wear all this Italian shit
because underneath,
I still feel
like the Bronx.
I think I need these clothes
and this watch.
My $2,000 watch is a fake,
and so am I.
I neglected the things
I should've valued most.
I valued this shit.
I take off my wedding ring
to call Pam.
Kelly, that's Pam.
Somebody got a 20
on this Pam?
Don't blame her.
I never told her I was married.
And if I did, she,
she would've told me to go home.
Kelly,
looking at you now,
I'm ashamed of myself.
All right?
I mean, l... I work so hard
on this image,
on Stu Shepard,
the asshole who refers
to himself in the third person,
that I only proved
I should be alone.
I've been dressing up
as something I'm not
for so long...
I'm so afraid you won't like
what's underneath.
But here I am.
I'm just flesh and blood
and weakness.
I, uh...
I love you
so fucking much.
I, um,
I take off this ring
because it only reminds me
of how I failed you.
And, uh...
and l... I don't want
to give you up.
I want to make
things better,
but it may not be
my choice anymore.
You... You deserve better.
You're not gonna
let me go.
Caller: No.
You never were.
I know a thing about lies,
and I know a thing or two
about liars as well.
Then why the confession?
I didn't do it for you.
Captain, Captain.
The call to his wife
originated 2:17
at a hard line from
the old Barkley Hotel.
You got a room?
Second window
from the corner.
All E.S.U. Units
still holding.
Bring 'em in from
the 52nd Street side.
Cover the windows,
the doors,
the fire escape,
every goddamn point of exit.
Right.
Stu!
Sgt. Cole: 52nd Street side.
...your lawyer's
coming down now!
Now.
Caller: At least you'll die
with a clean conscience.
No. You're the one
that's gonna fuckin' die.
Listen. Listen.
You can hear them right now.
They're coming up the stairs.
They're coming to get you.
And you know why?
Because I sent them.
Stuart, you can't
stop lying, can you?
What, I can't stop lying?
They're coming up
the fucking stairs.
They're coming to get you.
Look around you.
Look around you.
That room's getting fuckin'
smaller every second,
isn't it? Inch by inch.
You know what?
Until it's not gonna be
any bigger
than this fuckin'
goddamn booth.
They're in position.
They're in position.
- Move!
- Move! Move!
Caller: No, Stuart.
There's nobody out there.
There's nobody there?
Listen,
they're coming through
that fuckin' door
to put you
out of your misery.
You only got
a couple of seconds left.
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna run?
If this is true, Stuart,
then I have to take
someone with me,
don't I?
And since Kelly is
the most important thing
to you in your life,
I'll take her.
Take me! Take me!
This is about me!
I'm the fuckin' one
you want. Take me!
This is about me!
Come on!
Take me!
It's me you want!
Me you want!
This is about me!
I'm the fuckin' one
you want!
Come on! Take me!
This is Captain Ramey.
Somebody talk to me.
We're too late, Captain.
Son of a bitch psycho
heard us coming
and slashed his throat
with
a carpenter's knife.
What's his condition?
Critical. He's lost
a lot of blood.
Get him down here now.
I don't want nobody
dying on me.
All right.
Kelly, where's Kelly?
Sgt. Cole: Your wife's fine,
all right?
Now try not to sit up.
What hit me?
Rubber bullet.
Figured if someone
was gonna shoot you,
might as well be us.
Heh heh. Thanks.
Uhh, did you get him?
You did.
I didn't do anything.
Gotta give yourself
some credit.
You got yourself
out alive.
Doesn't always
happen that way.
- Kelly: Stu!
- Stu: Kelly!
Stu!
- Are you okay?
- It's okay.
I'm okay.
Oh, God.
I was so afraid.
I thought I wasn't ever
gonna see you again.
Me, too.
A lot of things
we got to talk about.
I only want to talk about
what you want to tell me.
I want to tell you
everything.
Everything.
Get that gurney
over here, please.
Get over here.
We lost him.
Hey.
Stu: I want
to stand up.
I got him.
Yeah, I got
to see him.
You don't wanna see
this, Mrs. Shepard.
Yes, I do.
Okay, take it easy.
Yes, I do.
Allow me.
Allow me.
Go ahead.
Ramey: You
recognize him?
Yeah. He... He
was down there
trying to deliver me
a pizza
I got the call.
I, uh, told him
to fuck off.
That's enough
these days.
Just give it
a minute.
We'll be driving,
and you'll be flyin',
my friend.
Whatever you say.
Nice shoes.
Italian.
You hung up, Stu.
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.
I feel bad
about the pizza guy.
But I couldn't miss seeing
you and Kelly reunited.
You don't have to thank me.
Nobody ever does.
I just hope your
newfound honesty lasts.
Because if it doesn't...
you'll be
hearing from me.
Stu, Echoing: Help.
Help.
Help.
Help.
Caller, Voice-over:
Isn't it funny?
You hear a phone ring,
and it could be anybody.
But a ringing phone
has to be answered, doesn't it?
Doesn't it?
Man: Hello?
