Fly me to the moon
Let me
play among the stars
Let me see
what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words
Hold my hand
In other words
Baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
Please be true
In other words
I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Please be true
In other words
In other words
I
Love
Good morning.
Jackson-Steinem.
You
How you doing, Buddy?
Doing any better,
it'd be a sin.
Good morning.
Good morning, Dan.
What's looking
good today?
If I knew, I wouldn't
be in this business.
Get out while
you're young, kid.
I came here one day
and look at me now.
Ah, look at you now.
Good morning, Brian.
Chuckie!
How's the woman slayer?
Still looking for the right
How you doing, pal?
If I had your looks, better.
Takes genetics, education,
and the right tailor.
Not that you learned anything.
Marv, I got a feeling
we'll make a killing today.
Oh, yeah?
Where's your machine gun?
Jesus, you can't make
a buck in this market.
The country's
going to hell faster
than when Roosevelt
was in charge.
Too much
cheap money.
Worst mistake was getting off
the gold standard.
Putney Drug. You might want
to look at it.
No. Take five years for that company
to come around.
But they got
a good new drug.
Stick to the fundamentals.
That's how I BM
and Hilton were built.
Good things
sometimes take time.
Look sharp today,
especially you rookies.
The Nikkei Index closed
up 90 points last night.
We expect heavyJapanese
buying on the opening.
Get on the horn
with your institution.
Utilities are
our top priority today.
And they're off and running!
Can we check that
for you?
I can confirm that.
We cleared up to 60,000...
G.C. At 481/2.
Yes, that's right.
The market just opened.
What are you
talking about?
Here's a hot lead.
Research just put thrifts
on the recommended.
Yeah! Dump them,
for Christ's sake!
Jack, 30,000. 38 top.
I'd go long at 23.
You got it.
Now you own it.
Conwest Air?
Let me check.
That's Industrial Oil...
for Templeton!
We are in the middle
of the biggest bull market
our generation
or any other ever witnessed.
Sir, if you'd take
five minutes of your time...
Looking for 50,000 Con Air!
What do you got?
September?
How about those Decembers?
Bud Fox,
Jackson-Steinem.
If I could have
five minutes of your time
to explain the extraordinary
opportunities
emerging in the
international debt market...
I know all about it.
Bud Fox, Jackson-Steinem.
If I could have
five minutes of your time
to explain the extraordinary
opportunities
emerging in the
international debt market...
I'm sure that, uh...
I need the information now,
before the close!
In 10 minutes, it's history!
At 4:00, I'm a dinosaur!
Sure, it's gone down,
but you got the tip, I didn't.
I didn't tell you to buy it.
Why would I tell you to sell it?
I can't give it back.
You own it!
He's not here right now.
That's what
you told us to say.
Give me that phone.
Hello?
Hello. This is the sales manager.
What seems to be
the problem?
Give me a break!
How was I
supposed to know
you were in surgery!
Want me to pull
my account?
No, sir.
I'll discuss that
with the account executive.
You're welcome.
I'm closing
the account out.
If he doesn't pay tomorrow,
you pay.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you
he's lying!
We give you one of those
rich man's accounts.
You tell me he'll D.K. You
for a Lousy 1/4 point?
You know he's got a history
of this kind of bullshit!
Somebody's got to pay.
Ain't going to be me.
Little trouble today, Buddy?
Howard the jerk
reneged on me.
I've got to cover his losses
to the tune of about seven grand!
Yeah, I'm holding.
I'm tapped out, Marv.
American Express has
a hit man looking for me.
Well, could have been worse.
Could have been my money.
Here, here, rookie,
let me help you out.
What do I got?
A C-note.
Thanks, Marv.
I'll make it up to you.
Yes, I am still here!
You know
what my dream is?
To be on the other end
of that phone.
You got it!
Where the real cheesecake is.
Bud, you forgetting something?
The Gekko phone call!
Buddy, when are
you going to realize
big game hunters
bag the elephants,
not guys like us.
Gordon Gekko, please.
30 seconds after
the Challenger blew up,
Gekko's selling
NASA stock short!
Yeah, but he made 23
on the Imperial deal before he was 40.
The guy makes 20 times
what Dave Winfield makes in a year,
and he talks
to everybody.
And he had
an ethical by-pass at birth!
Hello, Natalie?
Guess who?
Mr. Fox.
That's right.
Every day I tell myself,
"today could be the day."
Will you marry me?
- I'll think about it.
- That's terrible.
Please get me through
to Mr. Gekko.
Five minutes,
that's all I'm asking.
Mr. Fox,
I'm sure you're a good broker,
but our traders
deal with the brokers.
Mr. Gekko only deals
with investment bankers.
Tell him I called.
There are big changes
in the international debt market.
Leo, I understand,
but you have to realize there'll
be major subordinated debt involved.
Buddy boy,
how you doing?
Great, Charlie.
Any better would be a sin.
I hear all wall street guys
are millionaires.
When you gonna
make us all rich?
Give me 50 grand,
I'll get you a condo in Florida
next Christmas.
Sure! We'll own
the airline by then!
Let him make himself rich
so he can pay off
his school loans.
Nice to see you're
in such a good mood.
What did mom give you
fish for dinner?
You're smoking too much.
How many times
you gotta go to the hospital...
Leave me alone. It's the only thing
that makes me feel good.
Your mother still
makes lousy spaghetti.
It's called pasta now.
Spaghetti's out-of-date.
So am I.
You want a beer?
Yeah.
A Molson Light
for the kid!
He's looking good.
He looks terrific.
Carl, we'll be at the bar.
Nice seeing you, Buddy.
Take care.
You look like
you've grown another inch,
but you don't look so hot,
Buddy.
Starting to get bags under your eyes
like your old man.
I had a tough day.
Some jerk D.K. Ed me.
I got to cover his losses.
Speak English.
D.K. Didn't know
who I was
when the options he bought
took a bath.
I warned you
about that racket.
You could have been
a doctor or lawyer.
If you'd stayed
at Bluestar,
you could have been a supervisor
instead of a salesman.
I am not a salesman,
I'm an account executive.
Soon I'll be
in the investment banking side.
You ask strangers
for money,
you're a salesman.
I'm building
a client list!
I could make more money
in one year as a broker
than I could in five years
at this airline.
You borrow money
to go to NYU.
You made 50 grand
last year.
You still can't
pay off your loans!

Live rent-free

$50,000! Jesus Christ!
The whole world's off its rocker!
I made a total
of $47,000 last year.
That's before taxes.
That's Queens!
A 5% mortgage
I got to live in Manhattan
to be a player.
There's no nobility
in poverty anymore.
One day you'll be
proud of me.
It's yourself you got to be proud of,
huckleberry.
How much you need?
Can you spare 300?
I don't know if
I got that much on me.
Not in here, please.
It adds up.
You know 300 here,
Well, money's only
something you need
in case
you don't die tomorrow.
How you doing?
How's work
been treating you?
Damn mandatory drug tests
are driving my men crazy.
The only good news is
we had a meeting with the controller
about union business,
and guess what.
Remember the accident last year
and the investigation?
The FAA is going to rule
it was a manufacturing error.
I told them
it wasn't maintenance.
It's those god damned
greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati.
That's great, Dad.
We'll be out of suspension.
We can get new routes to Pittsburgh
and Boston now.
We'll compete
with the big guys.
Well, to Bluestar.
As your broker,
I advise that you hold on
to that stock.
What stock?
Are you kidding?
You sure
about this thing?
What?
The FAA
announcement.
Sure I'm sure.
Look at me.
You've got that mischievous look
in your eye, Buddy.
You used to smile like that
when you were a kid sleeping.
It's true,
just like that.
Morning, Gordon.
There's a delivery
for Mr. Gekko.
He needs your signature.
Send him in.
Hello, Natalie.
Recognize the voice?
I'll give you a hint.
You're seriously
considering marrying me.
You're lovelier
than I pictured.
I have Mr. Gekko's
birthday present.
You can't come barging in,
and what makes you think
it's his birthday?
It's in the bible, see?
You better buy him a gift.
Please, Natalie,
let me give this to him.
Cuban cigars.
Davidoff, his favorite,
and very tough to get.
Please, Natalie.
Stay here.
I'll see what I can do.
Wait outside.
Yeah, I'll see you shortly.
I hope.
Five minutes.
Well, life all comes down
to a few moments.
This is one of them.
What the hell's going on?
I'm looking at
Are we part of it?
We'd better be,
or I'm going to eat your lunch
for you.
Sorry, Jeff.
I loved it at 40.
It's insulting at 50.
Their analysts don't know
preferred stock
from livestock.
When it heads south,
we raise the sperm count.
This is the kid who calls 59 days
in a row,
wants to be a player.
Should be a picture of you
in the dictionary under
"persistence."
I'm looking for
negative control,
no more than
enough to block
any merger plans
and find out
if the books are cooked.
If it looks good on paper,
we're in the kill zone.
Lunch? Lunch is for wimps.
Billy,
I'll talk at you.
I'm Bud Fox.
So you say.
Nice meeting you.
I hope
you're intelligent.
Where did you
get these?
An airport connection.
So, what's on
your mind, kemo sabe?
Why am I
listening to you?
I've got to monitor
my blood pressure,
so don't upset me.
No, no, sir.
Within 45 seconds,
the microprocessor
computes your systolic
and diastolic
pressure.
Got an LCD readout.
Cost effective,
less than one visit
to a doctor.
I want to let you know
that I've read about you
at NYU business.
I think you're
an incredible genius.
I've dreamed of doing business
with a man like you.
What firm you with, pal?
Jackson-Steinem.
They're going places,
good junk bond department.
You're financing
thatJanson investment?
Yeah.
We're working on
some interesting stuff.
Cosmetic company,
by any chance?
Are you 12th man
on the deal team?
I can't tell you that,
Mr. Gekko.
Why are you here?
Chart break out
on Whitewood-Young.
from the book.
Couple of 5% holders.
It's a dog.
Very strong management.
It's a dog.
What else you got?
Mr. Stevenson
in San Francisco.
He respond
to the offer?
What?
He's in Chicago.
What is Cromwell doing
giving a lecture tour
when he's losing
He must give lectures
on losing money.
If he owned a funeral parlor,
no one would die.
This turkey's
totally brain dead!
Christmas is over,
and business is business.
Dilute the son of a bitch!
I want every orifice
in his fucking body flowing red.
He's flowing, Gordo.
This guy's the best trader
on the streets.
Susan, get me the LBO analysis
on Teldar Paper, please.
Mr. Gekko,
your wife.
What else?
What else you got?
Tarafly.
Analysts don't like it,
I do.
The breakup value
is twice the market price.
Sell two divisions...
Not bad, but that's a dog
with different fleas.
Come on, pal.
Tell me something
I don't know.
It's my birthday.
Surprise me.
Bluestar.
What?
Bluestar Airlines.
Rings a bell somewhere.
So what?
It's a comer.
flies Florida...
Canada, uh,
Northeast, Caribbean,
great slots
in major cities.
I don't like airlines.
Lousy unions.
There was a crash
last year.
They just got a favorable ruling
on a lawsuit.
Even the plaintiffs
don't know.
How do you
know about it?
I just know.
The decision should
clear the way
for new planes
and route contracts.
There's only a small float.
Good for a five-point pop.
Just got 250,000 shares
at 181/4 from Janson.
I can pull twice that
from California pensions.
We're near
half a million shares.
Huh? The terminator!
Blow them away, Ollie!
I think we've got
the Beezer brothers coming in.
I'm working on
the Silverbergs.
Rip their fucking
throats out!
Stuff them in
your garbage compactor!
Got a card?
Home number's
on the back.
Bud Fox,
I look at 100 deals a day.
I choose one.
I hope to hear
from you.
Thanks for the cigars.
We're going over 5% in Teldar.
Start the lawyers
on a tender offer at 13D.
We don't pay over 22.
They will fight.
Myers and Thromburg
are doing their legal.
Thanks, Natalie.
Have a nice day,
Mr. Fox.
Your conference call
is ready.
Mr. Sugarman
and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware,
Mr. Jackson
and Ms. Roscoe in London.
But, please, I'm begging you.
I'm in a bind.
I've got all these
damn new computers,
and young men
are edging me out of here.
Hey, Bud,
did he see you?
Yeah, he saw right through me.
Cheer up, Buddy,
You shook Gekko
the great's hand,
and you still
got your fingers.
Did you get something
from him?
Teldar Paper, huh?
Nah. It's a dog with fleas.
Fox.
Where have you been
for the last three hours?
If I were you,
and I thank
my personal god I'm not,
I wouldn't be
chin-wagging.
Plenty of six-figure names
in that zip code file to cold call.
Aagh!
Got tickets
for the Knick game.
Cruise some chicks afterwards,
what do you say?
I've got charts
to read.
Come on.
Forget charts.
We're not fund managers.
Churn them and burn them.
I'm offering
the Knicks and chicks.
God help you before you turn in
to poor Steeples there.
Preferably
Lou Mannheim.
Nice guy, swell fella,
but he's a loser.
He lost all his equity
in the '71 recession.
You want to be pitching
in your late 60s?
Whatever happened
to that cute analyst,
Sidney, Susan?
Cindy.
Sex with her
was like reading
The Wall StreetJournal.
She had a heartbeat.
I've got to get to work.
Zs today.
Call for you, Buddy!
Pick up two.
Bud Fox.
All right, Bud Fox,
I want you to buy 20,000 shares
of Bluestar
at 151/8th...
and don't
screw it up, sport.
Think you can
handle that?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
You won't regret this.
Wooo!
Marv, I just
bagged the elephant!
Gekko.
Hiya, sport.
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Gekko.
Try the steak tartare.
Louis will
make it for you.
Anything to drink?
Just an Evian, please.
Hey! See this?
Can you believe it,
a 2-inch screen?
I can hardly see it.
It's for my kid Rudy.
he's an electronics freak.
We're going
to a new age, pal.
Check.
So how's
business today?
Great.
Bluestar was at 171/4
when I left the office.
Might hit 18 by the bell.
Teldar's shooting up.
Buy any for yourself?
I bet you did
as soon as you left.
No, sir, that wouldn't
have been legal.
Sure.
Relax, pal,
no one's going
to blow the whistle on you.
Is that legal?
Put that in my account.
Hey, Gordon.
Georgie, the cellular king,
how you been?
It's nice to see you.
Oh, Gordon,
you look wonderful.
You're looking
very well yourself.
And Mr. Davis.
Can I get the check here, please,
for Christ's sakes!
Cover that Bluestar buy.
Put a couple hundred thou
on those bow-wow stocks
you mentioned.
Use a stop loss so your downside
is 100 thou,
and buy a decent suit.
You can't come in here
looking like this.
Go to Morty Sills.
Tell him I sent you.
Yes, sir.
Thank you for the chance.
You're with a winner.
Right, right.
Put the rest
in a mutual fund.
I want to see how you do
before investing it.
Save the cheap
salesman talk.
Excuse me, sir?
You heard me.
I don't like losses, sport.
Nothing ruins my day
more than losses.
You do good,
you get perks,
Lots and lots of perks.
Louis.
Yes, sir.
Take care of my friend.
Have a good lunch, Buddy.
Hi, Richard.
How are you?
Congratulations.
Hi, Bud.
Hi.
I'm Lisa...
a friend of Gordon's.
Lisa? Gordon?
Oh, oh,
Mr. Gekko, sure.
Uh, would you
like to come in?
Didn't he tell you?
Oh, that's
so like Gordon.
Why don't you
get dressed?
We're going out.
We are?
Mmm.
Let me see.
So, where are we going?
Wherever you like.
Lutece, 21,
the River Cafe...
or maybe we could just
drive around for a while...
work up an appetite.
Want some?
Sure.
Gordon tells me that you're a very
talented broker.
What do you like?
Like? Well...
This guy who should know
tells me to buy
Hewlett-Packard,
but I've been burned
on tips.
Um, Hewlett,
well, let's see...
it closed at 411/4,
up 1/8.
Very attractive.
Uh-huh.
About average yield.
Very attractive.
Mmm.
Rising profits,
strong balance sheet.
You're hot
on this stock.
Uh...
it's ready
to take off.
I'd jump all over it
if I were you.
Good morning, Carolyn.
Morning, Buddy.
You look happy.
Any better
and I'd be guilty.
You were never
that innocent.
How do you know?
You wish.
Taken in again
Again, again
Taken in again
Well, no, no, no, no
We can ask
the government
Not the people
Taken in again
Again, again
Taken in again
I mean, what... what
are you going to do?
America is waiting
for a message
Of some sort
or another...
God damn!
We went down the toilet
on that ugly bitch.
Buddy!
Mr. Gekko's
looking for you.
Be at the Wyatt Club Courts
at 6:00.
Aah!
Aah!
Come on, sport.
You've got to try harder.
You need exercise,
for christ's sake.
I don't think
I can go on, Mr. Gekko.
Let's go, Buddy,
push yourself.
Finish the game.
Very nice club,
Mr. Gekko.
Yeah.
Not bad for
a City College boy.
I bought my way in.
Now all these
Ivy League schmucks
are sucking
my kneecaps.
I just got on the board
of the Bronx Zoo.
It cost me a mill.
That's the thing
you've got to remember
about WASPs...
they love animals,
they can't
stand people.
Uh... Mr. Gekko,
we took
a little loss today.
We got stopped out
on Tarafly,
about 100 grand.
I guess your dad's not a union
representative
How do you know
about my father?
The most valuable
commodity I know of
is information.
Wouldn't you agree?
Yeah.
The public's out there
throwing darts
at a board.
I don't throw darts
at a board.
I bet on sure things.
Read Sun Tzu,
The Art of War...
"Every battle is won
before it's ever fought."
Think about it.
You're not as smart
as I thought, Buddy boy.
You wonder why fund managers
can't beat the S & P 500?
Because they're sheep,
and sheep get slaughtered.
I've been in this business
since '69.
These Harvard types
don't add up to dogshit.
Give me guys that are
poor, smart, and hungry,
and no feelings.
You lose a few,
but you keep fighting,
and if you need a friend,
get a dog.
It's trench warfare
out there, pal.
Hey, Georgie.
Hey, Gordon.
How's Larchmont
treating you?
Fine. How's the Praxer
deal going?
You should know, pal.
Asshole.
And inside here, too.
I've got 20 other brokers
analyzing charts, pal.
I don't need another one.
See you around, Buddy.
I am not just
another broker, Mr. Gekko.
If you give me
another chance,
I'll prove that to you.
I'll go the extra mile.
You want another chance?
Fucking A!
You stop sending me
information,
and you start
getting me some.
Get dressed.
I'll show you
my charts.
You know the name?
Of course.
Larry Wildman,
one of the first raiders.
Like all Brits, thinks he was born
with a better piss pot.
Bribed an old secretary
of mine,
stole RDL Pharmaceuticals
right from under me.
Wildman, the white knight.
I remember that.
You were involved?
Payback time, sport.
You see that building?
I bought that building
my first real estate deal.
Sold it two years later,
made an $800,000 profit.
It was better than sex.
At that time,
I thought that was
all the money in the world.
Now it's a day's pay.
Anyway, I had a mole
in Wildman's operation.
He gave me half the picture,
then got fired.
I don't follow.
Wildman's in town.
He became
an American citizen.
Something big is going down.
I want to know where he goes,
what he sees.
I want you
to fill out the picture.
Ah, Mr. Gekko,
it's not what I do.
I could lose my license.
If the SEC found out,
I could go to jail.
That's inside information.
You mean like
when a father tells a son
about a court ruling
on an airline,
or someone overhears
that I'm buying Teldar Paper
and buys some
for himself,
or the chairman
of the board of XYZ
decides it's time
to blow out XYZ?
Is that what you mean?
I'm afraid, pal,
unless your father's on the board
of another company,
you and I are going to have
a tough time
doing business together.
What about hard work?
What about it?
You stayed up all night
analyzing that dogshit stock
you gave me.
My father worked
like an elephant
until he died at 49.
Wake up, will you, pal?
If you're not inside,
you are outside, O.K.?
And I'm not talking about
some $400,000-a-year
working Wall Street stiff
flying first class
and being comfortable,
I'm talking about liquid.
Rich enough to have your own jet,
Rich enough
not to waste time.
dollars, Buddy.
A player...
or nothing.
Now, you had what it took
to get in my office.
The real question is whether you got
what it takes to stay.
Look at that.
Are you going to tell me
the difference between
this guy and that guy is luck?
Mohammed, pull over, will you?
I'll drop you off here.
I'm late.
Buddy, it's been
nice meeting you, O.K.?
All right, Mr. Gekko,
you got me.
Excuse me, please.
Excuse us.
Excuse me.
How wonderful to see you.
Do you have a reservation?
Table for one.
Reservations only.
We're booked for a week.
All right.
Don't touch.
Everything ready, sir.
Excuse me!
Mr. Wildman on board that plane?
Yeah.
Shit! My boss is going to kill me.
I was supposed to
give him this.
Where's he going?
Erie, Pennsylvania.
Thank you.
After spending the morning
at Kahn, Seidelman,
the junk bond department
where Shane Mora works,
with a group
of bean counters.
He stopped off at Morgan.
I'd say from all the sweet smiling
that Larry got himself
some nice fat financing.
Bright, but not bright enough.
Let's roll the dice
and play some monopoly.
Where will Larry land in Erie,
Pennsylvania?
Jesus Christ!
He's buying Anacott Steel.
When the market opens tomorrow,
I want you to buy
You hear me?
Start buying
Take it up to $50.
When it reaches 50,
give a taste
to your friends,
Then call
The Wall Street Chronicle,
extension 1605.
Tell the man,
"Blue Horseshoe
loves Anacott Steel."
You got that?
Congratulations,
Buddy, you scored.
Talk at you.
All right.
Start buying Anacott Steel
across the board.
Use the offshore accounts...
and keep it quiet.
Frank, 10,000 ANC at 46.
Let me know how the options
open, O.K.?
Thank you.
Jack, sign them!
How... How is
Anacott Steel?
I'll sell you 2,000.
That's not what I said.
I said 20,000 shares.
Anacott priced at six.
What do you...
And a quarter, 8,0001/4.
I'll take it.
What do you want?
Yeah, I know how it is.
This is what I'm saying,
we have important financial news,
Mr. Earlich,
that happens to concern
your future.
You could benefit...
What the hell's going on?
Anacott Steel,
put your best customers in it.
Lou, I got a sure thing...
Anacott Steel.
No such thing,
except death and taxes.
Not a good company anymore,
no fundamentals.
What's going on, Bud.
You know something?
Remember,
there are no short cuts, son.
Quick-buck artists come and go
with every bull market.
The steady players make it through
the bear markets.
You're a part
of something here.
The money
you make for people
creates science
and research jobs.
You're right, Lou,
but you've got to
reach the big time,
then you can
do good things.
You can't get
a little pregnant.
It's a winner. Buy it.
Then we'll kamikaze
over to Nell's
and chase some
cotton underwear.
I know this bimbette
that's gorgeous.
Hold on.
Play some tennis saturday?
I'm going fishing in Canada,
really big client.
Take Anacott.
Light snack, but good.
Sharking your way up.
My dear,
you've got to diversify.
I've got
a sure thing...
Anacott Steel.
I just heard the most
lovely two words.
Blue Horseshoe
loves Anacott Steel.
Anacott Steel?
Right.
Looks like Anacott Steel's
the play.
Check the arbs.
Looks like it's
being accumulated.
We've got to
position it.
Yeah, Lou,
Anacott, high buy.
Yeah. Take it and bid it.
If I'm right,
eighths and quarters won't matter.
This is really special... Anacott.
Make the tape.
Bet the ranch.
Buy 100,000 shares.
Wildman's...
It's on zoom.
If it hits 75,
we could clean 24 mill.
First lesson...
Don't get emotional about stock,
clouds the judgment.
... which closed
at 511/8,
up 51/8 from yesterday's close
on heavy trading.
Can I help you?
I'm Bud Fox.
I have some papers
for Mr. Gekko.
Come in.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about this,
Mr. Gekko.
It's all right.
It's O.K.
All right.
You want to wait here?
Problems?
There's no problem.
Bud Fox, my wife Kate.
A pleasure.
You came from the city?
Yes, ma'am.
Long drive.
You want a drink?
Yeah, you want a drink?
If you'd rather not...
Have a drink,
meet everyone.
It's a good idea.
That's Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters,
Stone Livingston.
This is Bud Fox.
His illustrious
wife Muffie,
Candice Rogers,
Dick Brady,
Darien Taylor,
all old friends.
Hi.
Hello.
Great idea, Gordon.
Good help
is hard to find,
But can he create
a dry vodka martini?
Doesn't talk back,
doesn't steal silverware,
and Dick's getting me
an exemption.
Dick.
I'm in St. Kitt's
with this new Kamali
leopard-skin bikini,
which is going to turn back the clock
on my marriage,
you know what I mean?
Call for you, sir.
Sir Lawrence Wildman.
He says it's important.
Thank you, Nyun.
Fix Mr. Livingston another martini.
This could be fun.
...all because
this Ukrainian bitch
botched the job
on my wax.
Oh, how ghastly!
You should sue.
Larry, what a surprise.
I want to see you.
Can it wait?
I've got some people over.
This can't wait.
If you feel that way,
come on over.
Listen, can I steal him
for a minute?
Of course.
I want your opinion.
So, what do you see in this?
Purity, innocence...
A few thousand dollars
down the tubes
if you ask me.
Really?
Well, I guess
you can kiss your career
as an art appraiser
goodbye.
We paid over 400,000
for it.
You could have had a whole
beach house.
Sure you could,
in Wildwood, New Jersey.
If you sold this one,
you could have a pretty nice
penthouse on 5th,
but you wouldn't have much left
for decoration.
It's nice
if you're on mushrooms.
Boy, I thought Gordon
was a real tough businessman.
He's really
taken a bath on that.
I'd say Gordon is one of
the most astute
collectors around.
He has a great eye
and only buys the best.
Like this rug,
a Boccaro,
the finest of its kind.
The day after
he bought it,
the Saudi royal family
offered twice
what he paid.
It absolutely
makes the room.
This celadon is picked up
by these cushions
on the sofa.
That Etruscan vase
on the coffee table
is sacrilegious.
Someone might use it
as an ashtray.
I guess you're a decorator?
You got it.
Great spender of other
people's money.
Well, if you're that good,
you could do wonders
with my place.
Where is that?
Upper West Side.
Home of the exposed
brick wall
and the house plant?
It's a rental.
I'm moving to
the East Side soon.
Couple of deals
brewing with Gordon.
What about real things,
like dinner, the two of us,
next Friday,
Cafe Santa Domingo?
What if I have a previous
engagement?
You break it.
There you go again,
Darien,
talking with strange men.
Sam, do you know Bud Fox?
Sam's in banking.
Works for Gordon.
Nice meeting you.
Are you staying for dinner?
No. I've got to work.
Ah, the bell.
Excuse me.
Call me next week
for an estimate.
Larry, how have you been?
Just fine.
Traveling actually.
Yes? Can I get you a drink?
Larry!
Excuse me.
Sir Larry.
How are you?
God damn,
you look great.
Gordon.
So you want to talk?
I'll be heading back,
Mr. Gekko.
Stick around.
This is Bud Fox.
Should we go upstairs?
Yeah.
The rarest pistol
in the world, Larry,
A.45 Luger.
Only six of them were ever
manufactured.
Congratulations.
Rarer still is your interest
in Anacott Steel.
My interest is the same as yours,
Larry...
money.
It's a good investment
for my kid.
I'm in for the long term.
It's not a liquidation.
I'm going to
turn it around.
You're getting
a free ride.
With the dollars you're costing me
to buy the stock,
I could modernize
the plant.
I'm not the only one
who pays here.
We're talking about
lives and jobs,
generations
of steelworkers.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
When you acquired
CNX Electronics,
you laid off
Jemson Fruit, 4,000.
That airline you bought, um...
I could break you, mate,
in two pieces over my knees.
We both know it.
I could buy you
six times over.
I could dump the stock
just to burn your ass,
but I want the company,
and I want your block of shares.
I'm announcing
a tender offer
at 65 tomorrow.
I'm expecting
your commitment.
Showdowns bore me, Larry.
Nobody wins.
You can have the company.
In fact, it's going to be fun
watching you
and your giant ego
try to make
a horse race of it.
Buddy, what's a fair price?
The breakup
value is higher.
It's worth 80.
We don't want to be greedy.
What do you say to 72?
You're a two-bit pirate
and greenmailer,
nothing more... Gekko.
Not only would you sell your mother
to make a deal,
you'd send her C.O.D.
My mail is the same color
as yours is, pal,
or at least it was
until the queen started to
call you "Sir."
Now, you'll excuse me
before I lose my temper.
Well, now, considering
you brought my mother into it,
Done.
You'll hear from my lawyers
tomorrow, 8 A.M.
Good night.
I had to sell.
The key is
capital reserves.
You don't have enough,
you can't piss
with the big dogs.
"All warfare's
based on deception."
Sun Tzu.
"If your enemy is superior,
evade him,
if angry, irritate him,
if equally matched, fight,
and if not,
split and reevaluate."
Yeah, hey, hey, he's learning, huh?
Buddy's learning.
Yeah.
Money never sleeps, pal.
Just made 800,000
Hong Kong gold.
It's been wired to you.
Play with it.
You done good,
but you've got to
keep doing good.
I showed you the game,
now school's out.
Mr. Gekko,
I'm there for you 110%.
No, no, no,
you don't understand.
I want to be surprised.
Astonish me, pal.
New info.
I don't care where
or how you get it,
just get it.
My, uh, wife tells me
you made a move
on Darien.
Well, here's some
inside info for you.
That euroflash GQ type
she's going out with
has got big bucks,
but he's putting
her feet to sleep.
Exit visas are imminent,
so I don't want you
losing your place in line.
Ah, Jesus...
I wish
you could see this.
Light's coming up.
I've never
seen a painting
that captures the beauty
of the ocean
at a moment
like this.
I'm going to make you rich,
Bud Fox.
Yeah, rich enough
you can afford
a girl like Darien.
This is your wake-up call,
pal.
Go to work.
Fox.
Mr. Barnes.
Buddy, is this deja vu?
What's it been,
a year and a half?
So, I hear you're moving up
in the world.
Senior associate.
Not bad.
How's Margie?
We got a house
in Oyster Bay, you know.
Market treating you good?
Still seeing
that sexy French chick?
No, no.
She asked the wrong question...
"What are you thinking?"
The hours are hell,
but the cash is tumbling in.
I know someone
who knows an ironclad way
of making money.
I can't get hurt.
Can't get hurt?
Does he have a tip
for honest lawyers?
Maybe...
check out Teldar Paper,
but don't quote me.
What about you?
I hear you're handling
the Fairchild Foods merger.
Any surprises
I haven't read about
Buddy, that's illegal.
I could get disbarred.
Well, who's listening?
Just one college buddy
talking to another.
Yeah, right.
Oh, relax, Roger.
Everybody's doing it,
but if you don't know,
then...
you don't know.
And if I did,
More money than
you ever dreamed of.
Nobody gets hurt.
You think about it.
Let's grab a beer.
What do you say?
No. Too much to do,
but I'll walk you out.
File's on the desk, Marie.
Get inside
my uncle's door, Bud,
all the secrets
of the world are yours.
The lifeblood of companies.
Of course, you've got to go
to law school first.
I've been charting the growth
of office space.
You're in the right business
at the right time.
I already know that.
I'm very impressed
with your work
in this
growing business.
Does working capital
and a partner interest you?
Why do I need a partner?
You need vans,
your employees can't cover
all your buildings,
not to mention
the clients
we could have together.
I'm an expert
at identifying undervalued assets
such as this business.
Well, the good news, Gordon,
is Roarker Electronics.
I see it happening
in the next few months.
You're kidding!
Their quarterlies are for shit.
I've got something
for you.
Let me see.
Gordon will be
very pleased.
What else have you got?
Let's get a pizza, man.
You know Marty Windman?
He netted 650G
off that merger.
The guy's an asshole.
He's a Rambo.
He's got himself
a Porsche Cabriolet.
If I make a bundle of cash
before I'm 30
and get out of this racket,
I can ride my motorcycle
across China.
I'd like to do
for furniture
what Laura Ashley
did for fabrics...
produce high-quality antiques
at a low price.
Sounds great.
I'll take you public.
You will?
Can I help you?
Oh, excuse me.
Is this Bill Bates' office?
No.
I'm sorry.
Hiya, dad.
What brings you out here?
A client...
and a private jet.
Hey, Buddy, how you doing?
Mr. Wall Street.
It's the bozos that keep us
in the air.
Give us a hand.
Change the oil
and park it out back.
This kid want to buy the plane?
How come you light up
when you see me?
Don't start.
Who peed in your Cheerios?
The fare wars are killing us.
Management's laying off
five of my men.
There's nothing I can do.
What's with you?
How much you need?
Nothing.
I'm doing great.
Things are
starting to happen.
Many guys at the track
talk like that.
How do you know you'll have dough
next month?
What is this?
I gave you a few hundred!
It's dividend.
I've borrowed at least five grand
in pocket change.
Put this toward
your school loan.
Look, things are good,
and it's going to stay that way.
Buy yourself a new suit.
Why do I need a suit?
I don't hobnob
with the jet set.
Get a bowling jacket
so you don't look like
the Roto-Rooter man.
What's money for?
Enjoy yourself.
Money's a pain
in the ass.
How about dinner?
Sure. Any night this week.
O. K... No, I'm sorry,
this week's booked.
I'll get back to you.
You know where to find me.
I got to run, Dad.
Stop smoking.
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!
Ohh!
Aah!
It's in both our interests
to put a safe distance
between you and us.
Now, you understand that,
Mr. Fox?
Sure.
This gives you
limited power of attorney
for Mr. Gekko's account.
Every ticket you buy must be marked
"power of attorney."
You call the shots.
Mr. Gekko has no knowledge
of what stocks
you're buying.
Sign it.
I never knew
how poor I was
till I started
making some money.
Your transactions will be monitored
by stockwatch.
If any trouble arises,
you're on your own.
The trail does stop with you.
You understand?
Spread the buy orders
over different accounts.
I have some friends that won't mind
making easy money.
Rudy kazootee!
How's my cutie?
Oh, yeah!
