CASANOVA: You want to know
all about me, don't you?
Well, let's see, now.
The first time I was in love
was June, 1975, in Boca Raton.
Her name was Coty Pierce.
She lived there with her parents
and her little sister, Karrie.
And I loved her, too.
I loved them both,
and they were in love with me.
They just didn't know it.
No one did.
I lived with them all that June.
WOMAN: I don't understand.
CASANOVA: I lived in the attic.
I was watching.
I loved the expression on their faces
when they slept.
And then I decided to declare myself
and show them
how much they loved me.
WOMAN: What happened?
CASANOVA: What happened?
Coty was honoured.
She kissed me back.
- And then Karrie.
-
And finally that night,
I kissed their mother, too.
Just a little pinprick. There.
Kiss me.
-
-
That's it. You guys watching this?
Good. Knock it back! Knock it back!
Good.
But you gotta remember, this game
is 80% winning and 20% talent.
You've got to keep running.
That's it, that's it, that's it.
That's my boy.
Good. Bring an uppercut.
Right hand. Good.
I don't want you to fall on your face
'cause you missed that jab.
What am I always telling you?
Power comes
from leverage and technique.
- You paying attention?
-
I gotta go, guys.
But you pair off and hit the heavy bag.
Three rounds each. Let's go.
How long has she been inside?
I'm on my way.
Their names are
Edmund and Dianne Wainford,
ages 48 and 42.
An item about seven years,
no prior complaints.
Neighbours are saying the usual,
they were divorced,
they were married, they were separated,
they were reconciled,
or in the process of.
His idea, her idea, no one has a clue.
All I know is that's Edmund,
and Dianne's in the bedroom.
- Whose gun?
- EDMUND: You stupid fucking bitch!
He had a.38
Smith & Wesson registered.
Look like a.38 to you?
You want a vest?
I don't think I'll need one.
Dianne?
This is Alex Cross, DCPD.
I need to talk to you.
Okay?
Dianne, I'm gonna open the door,
all right?
I'm going to open it now.
- Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
-
Please. Please, Dianne.
Look, I'm gonna close this door.
I'm gonna move this chair, okay,
and block the door.
That way nobody comes in,
and this stays
between me and you, okay?
Could you take the gun
out of your mouth, please?
Look, it's just as effective
if you put it to your temple.
Just makes it easier to talk.
- What sort of policeman are you?
- I'm a forensic psychologist.
It's a fancy way of saying I'm a guy
who walks into a room like that
and determines the hows and whys.
Then you don't need to hear from me.
No, no. I don't.
But I need for you to confirm
a couple of things for me.
For instance, did Edmund
often beat you after he drank?
And the turtleneck you're wearing,
is that to hide bruises?
Do you often have to hide marks
that he put on your body?
Two weeks ago,
he hit me.
And I swore it was the last time.
I finally get the nerve to leave
that son of a bitch,
and then he suckers me back.
You know what I think, Dianne?
I think you did what you had to do.
Thing now is just to figure out
how to finish things off.
-
- The right way, Dianne. The right way.
Look, is it all right if I come
a little closer?
Thanks.
Now, as I see it, all we have to do is
get photographs of your bruises.
Now, I know at least
half a dozen top-notch lawyers.
They specialise
in battered women's defences.
Point is, Dianne,
if you pull the trigger,
no one will ever know the truth.
Can I have it?
Dianne?
Samp, what are you doing here?
Doughnut raid?
Alex, hold on.
Look, uh, May's inside.
- Yeah?
- We got a call from Durham today.
Durham?
Naomi is missing. Come on.
What do you mean, "missing"?
They called May this afternoon
from the law school.
She called me. I called them back.
Told them who you were,
her uncle, and all that.
They said she's been missing
for four days.
Four days?
But Durham Police is on it now.
The guy I talked to sounded solid.
Don't talk to him, talk to me.
They stole my child!
Now, May, just take it easy.
Take it easy.
We're going to handle this together,
but with your high blood pressure,
I need you to relax right now, okay?
- Yeah, but what if...
- Now, now, now, now,
you just take it easy.
Relax and breathe. Look at me,
look at me. I want to tell you something.
Do you remember when Naomi
was about 10 years old, she got lost?
You got all frantic because you thought
we'd never find her.
- Do you remember that, huh?
- Yeah.
You were worried she'd have
an asthma attack or something.
Remember that?
Turns out she was with the neighbours
and everything was just fine.
Well, everything is gonna be fine now,
'cause I'm going
to handle this myself, May.
And you know you can trust me, right?
- You know I'm going to handle this.
- I trust you.
Okay.
Now, Nana is going
to take you up to Janell's room.
- You just relax for a while.
- I don't need to relax.
May.
Yeah.
ALEX: Good. All right.
I'll have to go down there.
Listen, Alex. Stay here.
Come on, John.
If they got a chance
to wrap it up down there,
how long do you think they're going to
hunt for one lost black girl?
Just stay here, man. I'll go down there.
There's nothing you can do anyway.
It's out of your jurisdiction.
You don't understand.
I got to go.
Please talk to me.
Talk to me the way you used to.
Please, say something.
Please. I'm sorry.
I can be better.
I can be good.
I won't be bad any more.
- CASANOVA: Yeah?
- Yeah.
Please, I swear.
- CASANOVA: You promise?
- Yeah.
I'll make you happy.
CASANOVA: How?
Let me show you.
CASANOVA: Tell me you love me.
-
- Tell me you love me!
I love you.
Megan, I don't believe you.
I love you.
- Of course you do.
-
Good afternoon, Sergeant.
Dr Alex Cross, Washington DCPD.
I'd like to see Chief Hatfield, please.
Well, Doctor, the Chief's tied up
at the moment.
We'll let him know you're here.
I'm sure he will be with you
as soon as he possibly can.
Take a load off.
Thank you.
- Sign this, sir.
- Dr Cross.
You've been waiting for us for a while.
About two hours.
Well, we got us a laid-back way
down here.
- So I see.
- DAVEY: Good.
- Run these names through the printer.
- MAN: Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about the wait.
Nick Ruskin.
Nick.
- Davey Sikes.
- Sikes.
It's been real busy around here.
We got a homicide,
and not your garden-variety, either.
Meaning?
That's all I know.
We are heading out there now.
You can ride with us if you like.
The board shows eight women missing.
How closely connected are they?
Well, they all share the same profile.
Young, late teens, early 20s, pretty,
all from inside the Research Triangle.
And each of them was ambushed.
No witnesses. Does his homework.
And then he ties them naked to a tree
and chops off their hair.
Only two bodies have been found.
This will probably be the third.
Oh, and the killer left a note for us
at the second murder scene.
- Signed it "Casanova."
- Casanova. The great lover.
Mmm-hmm.
This one here, is she white, black or...
All we know is she's a young woman
who didn't die happy.
Our Chief Hatfield will be up
at the scene.
I'll bet you two will get along
like pigs in a blanket.
Well, it's not her.
Dr Cross. My boss, Chief Hatfield.
Chief.
Now, is it Detective Cross, or Dr Cross,
or Dr Detective Cross?
Well, at a time like this, Chief,
it really doesn't matter.
As you can see, it's not your niece.
I'm happy for you.
Figured out who she is?
Megan Murphy. University sophomore.
I told your Captain Hathaway
I'd extend help
any way we could
given your special situation and all.
- Appreciate that.
- I want you to consider yourself
my guest. Make yourself at home.
But don't mess around in the kitchen.
Understand me?
Well, the TV news crews
can't be far behind.
The best-selling crime author
has arrived.
Kyle, it's good to see you.
You, too.
- I thought you were in Rochester.
- Well, things change.
- I see you're making friends fast.
-
Done my best.
I heard about your niece. I'm sorry.
How long has this been on
the Bureau's wish list?
A while.
Were the other two
tied up so extravagantly?
Yeah, our guy seems to find
square knots tedious.
You saw it's Dayton cordage, 7-gauge.
- Yeah, America's favourite.
- Mmm-hmm.
I suppose everything else
was too prolific to trace.
The guy's a pro.
A real student of the game,
and an enthusiastic rapist.
First two post-mortems indicate
vaginal tears like I've seldom seen
inflicted hours before death.
And then that's it.
No prints or fibres, no semen or hair.
- Except what he cut off her.
- Hmm.
What about cause of death?
Well, there are no signs of torture,
no weight loss, no drugging.
He just ties them up
and leaves them for the critters.
- Real student of the game.
- And he likes to play.
NICK: We've liaisoned
with the campus police.
Posted flyers.
Figured somebody out there had to have
seen something important.
An environment fit for blending.
For you, a security nightmare.
For him, paradise.
We're going to get this animal.
We've got a critically injured
eight-year-old girl
thrown from a motorcycle, no helmet.
She's going to get a CAT scan
as soon as you get her stable.
It's the third grade.
What is she doing on a motorcycle?
Her daddy decided to take her for a ride.
KATE: The pressure bandage
on this brachial is about to go.
We're a minute away
from a 30-second bleed-out.
I need a tourniquet.
DOCTOR 1: Retractors are ready.
- KATE: I'm going to do a cutdown.
- Watch your pressure drop.
KATE: Scalpel, please, Nurse.
Gauze and suture.
- What's her name?
- DOCTOR 1: Laura.
KATE: It's an awful lot of blood
for such a little girl, Laura.
DOCTOR 2:
Stand by, Nurse, with the bandages.
NURSE: Stand by.
I'll try to put you back together again.
I would suggest that you buy something
over the counter first
- and see if that helps...
- Excuse me, Nurse?
Just a minute.
It doesn't sound like this is too severe.
- Hi, Mrs Lee. I'm Dr McTiernan. Hi.
- MRS LEE: Doctor?
Hello.
She's alive.
Mrs Lee, wait...
Mrs Lee, Mrs Lee, listen.
Laura has suffered severe head trauma
and she is in a coma.
You can be with her as soon as...
-
-
Please let me see my baby!
I want to see the jab! Come on.
There you go. Good.
Now, move around the ring.
Around the ring. What are you doing?
Come on, back him up. Let's go.
Don't stay there. Back up.
- Watch your contact.
-
Okay, Barry off. Ethan, stay on.
Who's next?
Kate, let's go.
Okay.
Bring your snaps.
Go get him.
All right, let's keep it light, guys.
Come on, Kate, let's see something.
Come on.
I want to see the jab. Stick the jab
in there. There you go. Good!
Come on, stick it.
Let me see the jab.
Come on, on your toes. Use the jab.
JENNIFER: Come on, girl!
COACH: Nice! Good!
Okay, good. Let's go, work it.
Come on, on your toes!
MAN 1: Come on, Ethan!
What's going on?
MAN 2: Good!
-
-
Ethan, what are you doing?
Watch your contact, okay?
Kate, are you okay?
JENNIFER: This is a sorry
substitute for sex.
- I said, this is a sorry substitute...
- I heard you.
Yeah, okay.
- You know what I'm looking for?
- What?
The way my daddy looked at my mother.
What way?
Not gonna settle for anything less.
DAVEY: Sure picks lookers, doesn't he?
Yeah, he does.
Still, these women are more than
just attractive.
They are all extraordinary in some way.
Smart, talented.
Something tells me he ain't choosing
them just for their congeniality.
Ordinarily, they don't.
But I think our guy is a little different.
- How so?
- I think killing is not his ulterior motive.
This guy's a collector.
I bet these women are alive.
Come on, Doc. Our boy's brain
is as soft as a two-minute egg.
And nothing personal,
but I figure every one of them gals
is tied to a tree
just waiting to get found.
Well, think about it, Sikes.
The three you found were killed
out of sequence.
They weren't even among
the first abducted.
- That's right.
- Yeah,
but that don't mean
that they're not still out there.
ALEX: Oh, but, hell,
you would have found them by now.
He makes absolutely
no attempt to hide them.
And the way they were killed
is very revealing.
- That last long walk through the woods.
- Marching to their fate.
Exactly.
The rape, cutting off her hair...
- It's a punishment.
- Maybe for violating some trust.
What goddamn trust?
I don't know, Chief.
I don't know.
How would you like to pay?
Actually, there's another book
I'm interested in.
It's a picture book for children
in the hospital. It's about being brave.
It sounds like a book by Burke.
I'll see if we have it in stock.
Good night, fish.
-
-
-
-
- What do you want from me?
- CASANOVA: Everything.
Show me something.
Take it back. That's better.
Show me something.
Show me something.
There it is. Come on,
show me something. Shake me, baby.
Shake me.
Hit it, hit it, hit it.
You can't hold me, baby!
What is that, man?
Just get the ball, baby.
This is my court. This is my court!
Let me show you how we do it.
Here it is, here it is.
- All right, all right.
- Come on.
What you got? What you got?
That's all you got? That's all you got?
Get back, get back.
Get mad, get mad. What's up?
Hey, hey, hey!
- Come on, fellas!
- Break it off!
Hey, hey, come on!
Don't ever come back again.
Let me go. Let me go.
Don't ever come back here again!
Get out of here. It's my court!
ALEX: Seth Samuels?
I'm Dr Alex Cross.
Naomi's uncle.
And a cop.
Look, I don't recall inviting you here,
so you...
Can we talk for a minute or two?
Like I said,
I don't recall inviting you here.
Look, we can talk anywhere you want.
I already told you guys
everything I know.
Which was nothing.
Look, I've had cops on me for days.
In the middle of the night,
hauling me down to the station,
all up my ass about Naomi
and things that are
none of nobody's fucking business.
Looks like your business
is in the public domain, doesn't it, Seth?
What do you want to know?
I want to know about Naomi's violin.
It's not on the police inventory.
Is it here?
Well, she used to practise here
sometimes.
She was always practising on the thing.
But she always took it home with her.
Always.
Yeah, I know.
The cops don't have any idea, do they?
Not a clue.
-
-
-
-
- CASANOVA: I got all the glass out.
-
Everything you'll need to change
the dressing is right next to you.
- I brought some of your clothes, too.
-
Something for every occasion.
Can you hear me?
Systemic analgesic.
What did you give me?
CASANOVA: That's one of the reasons
I picked you, Kate.
- Your intelligence.
-
I appreciate that.
I know most men don't.
Can't.
I'm different. You'll see that in time.
- Now, try not to go back to sleep.
-
Hmm?
- Shh.
-
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I need to tell you the rules.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Why am I here?
- You are here
to fall in love.
- To experience love.
-
But now I need you to listen
very carefully,
and take what I say very seriously.
All right?
Don't try to escape.
Don't cry out for help.
And do not try any
of your kickboxing tricks.
- Oh...
- Do you understand?
Now, I'll do what I can to help you
not break these rules.
But if you do, Kate,
you will really disappoint me.
That's it.
There.
- See? That didn't hurt, did it?
-
Don't worry.
You are with Casanova.
MAN: Yes?
CASANOVA:
I thought you'd be out. Busy.
MAN: Well, you were wrong.
You've got mail.
You like?
- MAN: Nice.
-
MAN: Exceptional. Really.
I think she's extra special.
How are you feeling, old man?
Swimmers, take your mark!
COACH: Come on, keep going!
Move those bodies, let's go!
Kick it up, kick it, move it, move it!
Speed, speed, muscle, muscle!
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
I'm looking for Dr Wick Sachs.
Uh...
Lane five. He's destroying my varsity.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Let's go, blondie! Pick it up!
I can't tell you much
you don't already know, I'm afraid.
I gave Naomi some academic guidance,
which she politely disregarded.
And that was that. Excuse me.
I really don't have time
to get to know my patients very well.
Although I do know that Naomi
was a special woman.
My heart goes out to you.
Word is that you make time
to get to know
some of your special patients.
Whatever you may have heard,
I certainly don't have time
to kidnap and mutilate any of them.
I understand how you must feel,
you being a psychologist,
and a policeman, and her uncle.
It must be like suffering
the tortures of the damned.
For me or for her?
Well, both.
It's yours.
He's never made strikes
this close together before, has he?
An intern, huh?
Yeah.
He had a vacancy.
Never call out.
Never call out. Never call out.
Somebody help me!
My name is Kate!
I'm Kate McTiernan.
I'm a doctor at the Carolina
Regional Medical Centre.
I need help!
I know you can hear me!
- Come on! Who's out there?
-
Somebody help...
My name is Kate McTiernan.
Somebody talk to me!
- Who is out there?
- WOMAN: Be quiet.
Be quiet, or he'll kill you.
Oh, my God.
What's your name?
What's your name? Talk to me.
Talk to me please, please, please!
Tell me your name.
I'm Mary Jane Capaldi.
It's good to...
It's good to hear your voice, Mary Jane.
Are you okay?
I'm Kristen Miles. I'm here, too.
I'm Melissa Stanfield.
I don't know how long I've been here.
What month is it?
I'm Samantha Gaines.
Carol Akers.
My name is Naomi Cross.
I've been here for eight days, I think.
Yeah, I know.
I miss you, too, darling.
No, you know I do.
How's May?
Oh, that's good.
You stay with her now, you hear?
Hang on, Janell. Just a second.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"Odalisques were the most valuable
of the Emperor's treasures,
"gifted in the arts of music and poetry."
- Talented.
- Special.
"Welcome to Durham, Dr Cross.
"Giovanni Giacomo
Casanova De Seingalt."
Oh, I guess you've got a fan.
I'll say one thing for our boy.
He's got very nice penmanship.
He's fucking with you. That's all it is.
ALEX: Yeah, but this tells us
he's tracking the case.
He's reading the local papers.
We can use that...
An odalisque is a statue, right?
A tall, pointy thing with...
- No, you're thinking obelisk, Nick.
- Oh.
Odalisque is a harem girl,
a concubine, sex slave.
Oh, there it is, just like you said.
So he's telling us
all these gals are alive.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Why is he telling us that?
ALEX: It demonstrates his power.
His dominance.
Well, that certainly fits. Our profiles
of the murdered women show
they all shared one trait that would have
set off the control freak in our guy.
They're all strong-willed.
They're all defiant.
NICK: And how many of the other girls
share that profile?
At least one.
Oh!
You wanna hurt me?
Okay, come on.
They can be bigger.
Okay.
And they can be stronger...
You're fucking nuts!
I'll beat you.
Oh, my God!
CASANOVA: You could have
been the best, Kate.
I may be going crazy here,
but didn't I warn you
about breaking the rules?
- I'm sorry.
- "I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry."
- I'll do anything you want.
- What?
- What did you say?
- I said, I'll do anything you want.
Oh, I know you will.
Give me your arm.
I said, give me your arm.
Come on. Give it to me.
CASANOVA: Kate!
Kate!
CASANOVA: This is not
the way it works, Kate.
All right, now. Okay.
Easy, girl. Easy, now. Come on.
- ALEX: What do you know?
- Only that she's in some kind of shock.
The kids who found her were fishing
near the Wykagyl white water.
- The what?
- Wykagyl. It's a river way out of town.
Well, lookie here.
We got us a circus up ahead.
REPORTER: Here are the cops.
- Detectives, can you confirm...
- Come on, back... Back up, now.
ROUCCO: What concerns us
is behaviour that suggests
psychological trauma,
especially acute.
Doctor, Doctor, can you tell us
exactly when she'll be able to talk to us?
What I'm getting at is Kate McTiernan
appears to be suffering
from post-traumatic shock.
There's no telling when she'll be lucid.
It could be hours. It could be weeks.
You guys have to remember
that this girl is very lucky to be alive.
MAN 1: Doctor...
MAN 2: Can you at least tell us
your best guess?
MAN 3: We can't go on that, Doc.
Can you just...
Dr Ruocco, excuse me.
My name is Cross. I'm Dr Alex Cross.
Yes, I know who you are.
I know your work.
I'm consulting with the local police
on this case.
I need to see Kate McTiernan.
I'm sorry, but she does not need
another doctor.
Listen, the last thing I want
is to crowd you.
My request is personal.
One of the women abducted
was my niece.
I really need to talk to this woman.
It's all right. It's all right.
You're safe now.
You're safe.
- This woman's a fighter.
- I wouldn't argue with that.
But we were off pegging this
as post-traumatic shock.
Her vitals are meandering downhill.
Everything is systematically
shutting down.
And of course,
you screened her for drugs.
Yes, we did.
Her blood, her urine, they're clean.
Something is doing damage
that we don't have a finger on.
- Whoever did this...
- Is cunning.
Yeah, he's cunning.
- But he doesn't know his history.
- Hmm?
The real Casanova
would never have approved.
Excuse me. Do you have a PDR?
Mmm-hmm.
Unresponsive pupils,
progressive loss of muscular control,
- escalating tremors...
- That's what I see.
An overdose of benzodiazepine
would do all that.
Yes, but every drug in the benzo family
shows up in blood and urine.
Ah! Except Sistol. It's a benzo cousin.
Leukaemia specialists are using it
to take the edge off chemo.
Mmm-hmm.
- Is it an amnesiac?
- Absolutely.
We'll see what your theory is made of
by morning.
Mmm?
Who are you?
Uh...
My name is Alex Cross.
I'm a policeman from Washington DC.
How do you feel?
Sick.
- I'll get you a doctor. Hang on.
- Wait, wait, I was given a drug.
I think it was the nervous system.
Yeah, it was something called Sistol.
But we flushed it out of you.
It's nice to have you back.
- Washington?
- Yeah.
I'm... I'm down here
because of my niece.
She disappeared about 10 days ago.
Her name is Naomi Cross.
I talked to her.
Thank you.
I'll get that doctor for you.
I...
I heard so many different voices,
and I tried not to cry.
DAVEY: No way does our boy
show his face here.
If he's not here, he's watching.
I guarantee you.
DAVEY: You make it sound like
he ain't cooking on the front burner.
If he's so dumb, how come
we haven't caught him yet?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I'd like to introduce to you
a very brave young lady.
Dr Kate McTiernan.
Dr McTiernan will make
a brief statement, and that's all.
No questions, please.
Hello, I'm Kate McTiernan.
First, I'd like to say something
to the families who have
a loved one missing.
Please, do not give up hope.
There are other women
where I was held.
And I believe in my heart
that they're still alive.
Second, to the boys who fished me
out of the river and saved my life,
and to the nurses and doctors here
who are taking
such excellent care of me,
and for the thousands
of letters and prayers
I've received from all across America,
thank you.
And last,
to the man who calls himself Casanova,
the man who took me
from my own home
and ultimately tried to kill me,
I broke your rules. Just me.
None of the other women helped.
So if you're looking
for someone to blame,
blame me.
That's all I have to say right now.
Thank you for taking my message
to the families of the missing.
And I hope it helps a little bit.
Thank you.
REPORTER 1: Dr McTiernan...
REPORTER 2: What's the boys' names?
- ALEX: What do you hear? Dogs?
- No.
- Any kind of animals? Is it a farm?
- I don't know.
- Do you hear the river?
- No.
I hear him
whispering.
What does he say?
I can feel his mouth on my ear.
His breath.
He tells me that he loves me.
ALEX: Tell me about his face.
Tell me about his eyes, his mouth.
He has no face.
A mask. He always wears a mask.
- What kind of mask?
- I can't...
- What does it look like?
- It changes.
I can't show him that I hate him.
But you escaped.
What do you see when you escape?
I don't know.
I'm just running, and my legs
are heavy from the drugs.
And I'm lost. I'm running through
hallways and there are all these rooms.
I don't know where to turn.
- He's behind me!
- ALEX: He's not behind you, Kate.
You get away.
How? How do you get out?
Light.
Light. In the light, in the sun.
- Do you see a barn?
- No.
- A house?
- No.
- Cabin?
- No!
There's nothing. Just the light.
It hurts my eyes.
And then the trees. The trees again.
And the rocks are digging into my feet,
and I hear him shouting behind me,
and I try to run faster.
That's all I'm thinking, "Just run faster!"
And I left those girls behind.
I wasn't thinking.
- I just told myself to run, to run and run.
- ALEX: All right, all right, all right.
It's okay. It's all right.
- I left those girls...
- It's all right. It's all behind you.
ALEX: You pretty familiar
with these woods?
SETH: Yeah, I come up here sometimes.
ALEX: What do you run into up here?
I mean, beside the obvious,
hikers, bikers, campers?
Locals, college kids. That's about it.
- What about this river?
- It's good for trout fishing.
It's been that way since
the early colonial period. It's over here.
What? What?
I still have to remember that my niece
wouldn't be fooling around
- with some knucklehead.
- Right.
Kate?
You okay?
I'm fine.
Really, I am. I'm fine.
I'm just sorry I can't take you to her.
I made an interesting discovery
last night.
About what?
I ran a check on all the Sistol orders
over the last five years.
- Guess what?
- What?
A Beverly Hills plastic surgeon
came up on the list.
There's no protocol for Sistol
in plastic surgery.
Bingo.
Two years ago,
this guy ordered enough
to treat leukaemia
in a medium-sized country.
- What's his name?
- Rudolph. William Rudolph.
Grew up in Durham.
Did his premed work here.
Dr Cross, is it him? Is he bicoastal?
Bicoastal?
That's an interesting way of putting it.
There are about a dozen predators
operating in California now.
There's one, male Caucasian,
probably early 30s,
he's known as the "Gentleman Caller."
They've been on to him for over a year.
And what I realised last night
was that his abductions,
they followed the ones here
by about 10 days to two weeks.
Matter of fact, it was exactly 10 days
after Naomi disappeared
that a pretty, black coed
disappeared from UCLA.
- So he's doing it there, too.
- Compulsively.
And if he follows true to form,
he's due to hit California pretty quick.
Can the FBI pick him up?
If I get Rudolph to the FBI,
and they make one mistake,
what happens to all these girls?
I can't risk Naomi starving to death
in a cell somewhere.
- No FBI.
- You're going out there on your own.
- I've got people.
- Take me with you.
I think you're best served
by staying here right now.
And pretend like nothing's happened?
No, no, that's not what I was gonna say.
- I just think you should return...
- Dr Cross,
I'm the only person who's seen this guy.
I know his size, I know his voice,
I know the way he moves...
- Kate, I know how you feel. Honestly.
- Would you please
stop treating me like I'm a victim?
You think I'm some kind of tourist
in all this because I wasn't raped?
Every night, when I go to sleep,
I hear those women's voices.
You want to save your niece?
Well, guess what? So do I.
I don't see my cousin.
- JOHN: Alex!
- There he is.
- Hey.
- Kate McTiernan.
John Sampson, DCPD,
cousin, compadre extraordinaire.
- How do you do?
- Hello, Kate.
Meet Henry Castillo, LAPD.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
- Dr Cross, it is a pleasure.
- Mine, Henry.
Um, Alex, can we huddle?
- Excuse me, Kate.
- Yeah.
JOHN: Well, this is a surprise.
Time was surprises
made you giddy, John.
What's the matter?
Look, we're out on a limb here.
Now, I've pulled every string.
I've called in 10 years of favours
to get those cars and equipment.
This thing has got to go as smooth
as silk, or we are both fucked.
Understood.
I've got him, 10:48 a.m.,
crossing the north window.
Attention. Rudolph just
walked past the window.
Thank you for the update.
It's him. He's on the move.
This does not look like a 7-Eleven run.
Where does this road go?
Vancouver.
He sounded so sincere.
- How's that?
- When he told me that he loved me.
- I expect that's because he does.
- Please!
Multiply your anger
by about a hundred, Kate.
That's how much
he thinks he loves you.
Okay. Rudolph has landed.
There's a cabin about a half mile in.
So he hasn't travelled that far, after all.
He's back in the woods.
First time in California?
- It's a pretty state, ain't it?
- It's unforgettable.
RUDOLPH: What do you want, huh?
Go ahead. What?
I can't hear you! They'll kill me!
No! Shut up! Because you're sick!
What the fuck is he doing?
- He's in a rage.
- He's going fucking nuts.
He is about to scare the wildlife
out of this forest.
That's what she's saying.
Let's go. Let's fucking go. Come on.
Tell me, what did you see back there?
A killer getting organised.
Guys, he's not gonna be
abducting somebody from this place.
The word is this guy's pulled people
out of these joints before.
Not in the Triangle.
We'll cover him loose,
see what he's got. Henry, you stay here.
If it's so crowded,
how come I can't come?
- If he even thinks he sees you, it's over.
- What about you?
Twenty years of experience blending in.
You stay with Henry.
ALEX: There he is. Across the bar.
JOHN: Damn.
He's in there just like that.
Mr Lover-Lover.
We ought to nail his ass right now.
Never been the same without Fernando.
I can't believe those guys let him go.
Unbelievable, man.
He had this knuckleball,
it was like a floater, then bam.
Right off the table, couldn't even come
near it. You're kidding yourself.
What do you got down there?
The Durham Bulls?
Ranked Triple-A? Got any prospects?
- EDF 40, full military specs.
- I'm going to go in.
What? Hey, hold on!
Come here. Come here, you.
- I've got to pee.
- No, you don't, okay? I'm not that stupid.
Henry, it's not really your style.
You don't know what my style is,
all right?
Your style is to help me blend in.
Henry, help me blend in. Come on.
All right.
Right here, right here, right here.
Okay, I am going to walk over
and find our boys, all right?
You shall stay right here.
Mmm-hmm.
You won't move. Wonderful.
Hey.
Kate.
Is that him? Is that Rudolph?
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.
- It's him.
- ALEX: Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Okay.
Stand still.
Follow the tree line to the drive.
Henry, you break left.
You and I, we'll take the front.
Now, guys, remember,
when it goes down,
I need this guy intact.
Alex.
Be careful.
WOMAN:  No! No! No!
No!
Go.
-
-
It's okay! It's okay! It's okay.
Oh, shit. Henry. He's hit.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Take it easy.
-
-
Hold it! Hold it!
Put your hands where I can see them.
Get out of the truck!
Get out of the truck!
Yeah, roger, here.
We're ready to transport.
How is he?
I'm sorry, Sam. For all this, I'm sorry.
Yes, "shocking" is
an accurate way to describe
what went on here
in the early morning hours.
Local police won't comment,
but Channel 6 sources tell us
that what happened here
in the pre-dawn hours...
- KATE: Does this hurt?
...reaches beyond southern California,
and some say,
involves a rogue branch of the FBI...
They sure can document a fuck-up
at the speed of light.
Here's what we know.
Well, I guarantee
you won't be seeing a picture
of that woman
whose life you saved on TV.
Okay, breathe in. How's this?
Mmm-hmm.
A little tender there.
Lying critically wounded, shot twice...
What about here?
Police also found an unidentified...
- We need X-rays.
- Not a chance.
Detective Castillo and the woman were
rushed to a nearby emergency facility
where their condition...
Gone in the night.
At least now the FBI know
who they're looking for.
- How far can he run?
- It's not a question of how far.
It's how long.
...asking lots of questions and receiving
very few answers.
Questioned on the scene,
Detective John Sampson,
whom we've learned
is about 3,000 miles
- out of his jurisdiction.
- So, what do you want to do?
Sampson is a detective
in good standing
with the Washington DC
Police Department.
From what local police tell us,
Sampson was part
of a ragtag surveillance team.
Sampson, Detective Castillo and
two other unidentified individuals
were on a stakeout,
but staking out whom or what?
Property records indicate
the cabin owner is Dr William...
KATE: Hi, I'd like to see
about making reservations
from Los Angeles to Raleigh-Durham
for two people for tonight.
...was Dr Rudolph, a man
with no criminal record to his name...
KATE: Okay, it's the return portion...
- Hang up the phone, Kate.
- Pardon me?
Hang up the phone.
Dr McTiernan.
Welcome to our crime scene.
The sight of yellow tape and flashbulbs
must be getting
a little old to you by now.
- A little.
- You got here quick.
- Not quick enough, wouldn't you say?
- Now, wait a minute, Kyle.
- Let's not downplay the upside of this.
- Upside?
Yeah, the upside. We ID'd Casanova.
You got a trail.
Alex, don't even try. It's bad form.
The day you set foot in Durham...
Look, I feel like you've been
screwing me around.
- Why?
- Look, I let you in.
I shared information.
What have we got? A mess, and a cop
who's looking at two years of rehab.
Kyle, do you want me to say,
"I fucked up"?
All right. I fucked up.
Just don't shut me out of this.
What do you see?
- Maybe I'm looking too hard.
- For what?
I don't know.
It seems so cold.
Not like him.
KYLE: Alex.
Keep looking.
Thought the closet looked a little tight,
so I brought in a DX fluoroscope.
It scanned what appeared
to be a lunar module.
It's a freezer.
Trophy case.
Guy's got divergent MOs.
He's Don Juan on the east coast,
Josef Mengele on the west.
- We found feet.
- What?
You heard me. Surgically band-sawed
at the ankle, vacuum-bagged.
Fifteen pair, two lefts.
Go figure. Obviously not a dancer.
Check out the shrine.
Gentleman Caller.
Casanova.
And there hasn't been a multi-territorial
predator since Jean De Salle, 1921,
eviscerating Paris prostitutes
and strangling widows on the Riviera.
And running a bicoastal operation?
Man, this is the most ambitious stunt
in the annals of serial pathology.
This guy is Houdini squared.
Put on brakes, now.
We're not dealing with Houdini here.
What we have here is
Leopold and Loeb.
Home team. Visitors.
We've got 30 ampoules of Sistol here.
The chronologies match.
There are two of them,
and they're collaborating.
Collaborating and competing.
Got an ID on him?
He's probably just some kid
Rudolph did 20 years ago.
We'll comb through missing persons.
- We'll find him there.
- Don't bother.
- You know who he is?
- Mmm-hmm.
And he's got both his feet.
I'm giving you three minutes
to throw that bolt.
Am I wasting my time?
Okay, boys. Nobody home.
You all take upstairs now.
Be clean, boys. Clean and thorough.
Keep the goddamn media out.
Nick, you got the Chief there?
KYLE: Alex.
How long has he been in the box?
Five, six hours. They took him
in the middle of a class lecture...
- This is bullshit, Kyle. This is bullshit!
- You know I wouldn't sanction this.
Look, Hatfield got the tip.
I don't know how.
Stages a huge public arrest.
By the time I'm on the ground,
he's already got this guy...
You guys call in $2 million worth
of surveillance equipment
and these clowns stage a cold arrest?
Oh, that is top-notch police work.
Top-notch.
Alex, this is all politics.
- It's all bad, Kyle.
- Alex, not all.
Dr Sachs.
It's good to see you again,
circumstances notwithstanding.
Can I... Can I get you anything?
Coffee? Soda?
Oh, come on, Wick.
There are some questions
you can answer without a lawyer.
For instance, you might have said,
"Yes, thank you, I will have coffee,"
or, "No, thank you."
You know, just to be polite.
You don't drink coffee, do you?
You probably stick to bottled water.
What the hell is he doing?
That's how you stay in fighting trim.
He is doing what he does.
Where does the best bottled water
in the world come from?
The Alps? Some French aquifer?
- Futokan.
- I'm sorry?
Futokan. It's Japanese.
You wouldn't know it.
It's in the Japanese character
to do this sort of thing.
They build these special ships
and sail them
to the farthest navigable extremes,
and look for the bluest iceberg
they can find.
And they tow it back.
And one is able to drink
something that was last in liquid form
about 30,000 years ago.
Expensively clean.
What does it taste like?
Like water.
By the by, Alex. Writing a bestseller?
- You must be a millionaire.
- No, no. Far from it.
I bring it up
only because I mean to sue you
along with these other local imbeciles.
For what? Defamation of character?
I like to fuck,
variously fuck, young women.
I have fucked nearly
but I have never hurt any of them.
There is no record of violence
anywhere in my past.
Mmm-hmm.
Megan Murphy.
Oh, yeah. This is
a painstaking recreation of an image
from Friedrich Thelen's Die Welt
der Flagellanten. Do you know it?
That took me three hours
to tie her up properly.
And consensually, by the way.
Dr Cross, tell me
you've got more than this.
I have pictures of Megan tied to a tree.
No. I was thinking we'd discuss that
at the trial in, say, six months?
But maybe you would like me to go on
record now about Naomi.
Let's start with the first time I saw her.
In my office.
She was wearing a silk blouse,
which pleases me
because I like to turn up
the air conditioning
to constrict the capillaries.
You know, tweak the nipples.
You should have seen
how self-conscious she was.
How nervous the chill
in the air made her.
And like the others, her manner
belied her real predilections.
Which reminds me, Doctor, have you
seen the photographs of Naomi?
KYLE: Alex! Alex!
Back up! Back up! Move! Move!
Put your hands down! All right.
Settle down, settle down. All right?
Everything's all right.
Naomi. Well, you're just as pretty
as your picture.
Beautiful feet.
ALEX: What do you hear? Dogs?
-
...hear the river?
KATE: No.
I hear him
whispering.
ALEX: What does he say?
KATE: I can feel his mouth on my ear.
I take it we didn't get our confession.
We didn't. He's not Casanova.
His picture was on the wall.
- ALEX: That's part of their thing.
- But his picture.
Kate, it's a setup.
Brothers-in-arms
watching each other's backs.
Wick Sachs is the perfect patsy
for them.
He's too smug and too vain
to even know what hit him.
He's just a bush-league letch.
The cops think they got the right guy.
- I've been listening to the tape.
- Yeah?
Have you ever heard
a foetal sonogram? An ultrasound?
You know, on the tape,
you asked me if I heard anything.
Yeah. You said, "Nothing."
That's not true.
I heard something.
It was in the background.
It was constant.
- I heard water.
- Water?
Everywhere. Below me, above,
around, everywhere.
I had to have been in a basement.
Not possible.
Every farmhouse, barn, outhouse,
chicken house, doghouse...
- The FBI have checked everything...
- They missed it.
Kate, I saw the aerial photographs.
They didn't miss an inch.
There were doors, there were walls,
there were stairs.
It was man-made. It was built.
When you escaped,
you had no recollection of a house.
You said there was light. That's it.
"Suddenly there was light."
And I had been in a house, Alex.
I am sure of it.
Okay. Here's what we're looking for,
a plantation layout.
So now, there weren't plantations
on the Wykagyl.
- There was a plantation.
- What?
Check it out.
All this is Mason's property.
All right, now, this is hundreds of acres.
Here's the big house, slave quarters,
stables, cellars for stashing food, ice,
- tunnels everywhere.
- Can I see this?
- The river runs right through it.
- Where was I found?
Around here.
Two miles down from the big house.
ALEX: Okay.
I figure that's about 1,000 yards, right?
Forget here, forget here. This square.
That's where we concentrate.
No!
Bach is crisp. Crisp.
This is quite a collection
you've assembled here.
Your palette is so multicultural.
That's very PC, I applaud you.
But this place is a little overdone,
don't you think?
I mean subterranean Gothic went out
a while ago, didn't it?
You ought to get yourself a maid.
You know what this shit is?
This is Civil War bat guano.
It's full of fungus.
Inhale enough of this stuff, you'll have
a prostate like a 70-year-old.
What about you girls? Any complaints?
Any muscle aches? Lesions? Malaise?
Come on. Don't you think
they'd be better off in a freezer?
- CASANOVA: You know this is off-limits.
- Nobody tracked me.
CASANOVA: Of course, just like your
cabin in the woods, right?
I'm not the one who made
all the phone calls.
I wasn't posting fucking photographs
on the Web.
CASANOVA: That's not how they found
you, Will, or they would have found me.
- You don't belong here.
- If you're here, I'm here.
RUDOLPH: I need you to help me.
- I only want what I gave you.
- CASANOVA: You gave me nothing.
Remember '75?
Roe Tierney, homecoming queen.
Blood on the walls.
I cleaned up your slop. I always do.
Face it, Will, I'm your mentor.
- And you're the bad seed.
- Let me tell you something, my friend.
No matter how far out there you go,
no matter how you dress up,
when you come back,
you're still just like me.
RUDOLPH: Naomi, let's hear
something triumphal.
Something worthy of rebirth!
Play something for us.
- Play!
- CASANOVA: No!
- She plays for me.
- She only plays for you?
Well, of course she does!
Because you are the great lover!
The dark figure of her dreams.
Come on, darling.
Tell him.
Tell him how grateful you are,
tell him how you always wanted
to be his.
Go on, tell him.
Tell him how you wait for him.
Tell him how he is the most sensitive,
the best you've ever had.
Tell him that you love him.
That's what he wants to hear.
-
-
CASANOVA: I could have aimed
two inches to the left.
Don't forget who we are
and who you'll be if I'm gone.
You can have a hundred women here,
but without me, you'd still be alone.
CASANOVA: Take the stairs.
Go on! Go!
Police! Freeze!
Hold it!
- Naomi?
- Alex?
- I'll be back.
- No, don't go.
I'll be back.
- KATE: Alex!
- I found them! Up the hill!
William, who is he? Tell me his name.
He's too good. You won't...
I'm waiting for the good news.
It keeps getting better and better.
Come on.
This is Casanova's next crop,
blueprinted to a tee.
And we're in luck.
He didn't wear gloves.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, I want
all this stuff to Quantico now.
If you can't find a plane, buy one.
- Dr Cross, the man you shot...
...sex life in LA, can you...
...is a Dr Rudolph of Los Angeles.
How did Casanova escape
without a trace?
You got company.
- Good to see you, Seth.
- Thank you.
- Hey, you.
- Hi.
You okay?
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.
Got something for you.
Ta-da!
What happened to the strings?
New strings for new music.
Thank you.
When is her mom coming down?
- In the morning.
- When are you heading out?
The Bureau thinks they'll have
Casanova ID'd within 12 hours,
which really means 24.
As soon as Kyle gets
a bead on him though, he's done,
no matter how much road he's burned.
After that, I'm out of here.
So then, that's it.
I only have you for another day.
All right. Supper at my house tonight.
Home-cooked.
I promised Naomi I'd meet her at 8:30.
I'll make a lousy date.
Fine, do whatever you gotta do.
Be at my house by 7:00.
You'll be gone by 8: 15.
Hey.
If you would just verify and sign there.
Nineteen shots fired,
and one W. Rudolph,
room temperature.
- Good luck to you, Alex.
- You, too. Take care of yourself.
As you already know,
the hostages are now safe,
and are being cared for
at Carolina Regional Medical.
As for the forensics team,
they include our very best.
Specialists in latent prints,
fibre and hair study,
serology and DNA analysis.
I'm very encouraged by their progress.
In less than two hours, over...
KATE: Yeah, it feels...
It feels really good.
It's not exactly normal.
I think that'll take some time.
It's different, but it's nice.
It's like getting acquainted
with an old friend.
ALEX: Are those rottweilers of yours
out there on the case?
Well, I'm tempted to yank your chain,
but they're out there, standing post.
- Is that what you call it?
-
Yeah. Thanks for indulging me.
I'll see you soon.
Okay. Bye.
Well, look who's here.
- Hi, Detective.
- Hi. Sorry to bother you.
Uh, I brought this from the property clerk.
I'm sorry. Would you like
to come in for a minute?
- May I get you something to drink?
- No, thanks.
The next shift won't be here
for an hour or so, so...
I really ought to wait for them out here.
Excuse me for just a minute.
Don't go, okay?
Hello? Hi, Jen.
Son of a bitch!
Quit hovering. Come on in.
No, I'm not talking to you.
I've got company. Can I call you back?
Bye.
How do you feel about Indian food?
Oh, please.
I don't want you to trouble yourself.
I could use some help cooking,
and I have enough food for an army.
Would you like a glass of wine?
NICK: No, thank you. I'm on duty.
KATE: Your first chore is to
slice mushrooms. Can you do that?
- NICK: I believe I can do that.
- If you don't mind, rinse them first.
- Come on.
-
You should use a colander.
That way'll take forever.
It's down on the...
ALEX: Oh, shit!
How are you feeling by the way?
You feel like you're getting back
on your feet?
I guess if I felt solid anywhere,
it should be in this house.
I've been in it one way or another
my whole life. It was my great aunt's.
But I don't know. It's just different now.
Something's off.
I used to walk in the middle of the night
down to the corner market
for a quart of milk.
It's true. I mean,
people just get complacent. It happens.
Would you please hand me
the big chopping knife?
NICK: The department gives courses
on self-defence.
I've already been thinking
about spending more time at the dojo.
Oh, kickboxing's fine, Kate.
But that's not what I mean.
I'm talking prevention.
We teach things like
varying your routine,
keeping your lights on at night,
maybe getting a dog.
I'm sorry, does this bother you?
It's good. I need to hear it.
Just simple things
like carrying personal alarms,
taking your garbage out the morning of,
and not using cordless phones.
You know, anyone
with a scanner can listen in.
What does taking your garbage out
the morning of
have to do with anything?
Well, the night before,
anyone can tear through it.
Who in the world could possibly care
how much tuna I eat?
Would you rinse this off for me, please?
Think about it. A guy could come by,
say, Tuesday night,
dump your trash in one
of those 30-gallon plastic sacks,
haul it down
to an abandoned lot and bingo.
- There it is.
- Thank you.
What a lady eats,
how often she shaves.
You can even tell
a lady's time of the month.
Anything you want to know.
What kind of lipstick she wears...
And used condoms.
How often is she getting it?
Twice a week? Three times?
The same guy? Different guys?
Of course, that doesn't apply to you.
Let's face it. In your case,
it's been quite a while, hasn't it?
Not since that surgeon, what,
six, seven months ago?
You were special, Kate. Do you have
any idea how much time I gave you?
Months. Yes, months.
I sacrificed for you.
But now I'm going to show you sacrifice.
Oh, what are you going to do?
You gonna cut me?
- Do it!
-
Good girl.
Now I'll show you.
Don't do it, Nick.
Let's talk about it, okay?
You wanna put the lighter
down, Nick? Please?
She has to know.
She knows, Nick.
Then why don't you shoot me?
I don't think so. Muzzle flare.
Room full of gas, all that, you know?
Look, Nick.
I'm going to put the gun down.
Look. See?
There, now. How's that?
I want you to think about this, Nick.
If you do this,
no one will ever understand.
- Oh, don't mindfuck me!
- No, no, I'm not, Nick. I'm not.
NICK: You see, Kate?
It's all about building rapport.
You use the subject's first name.
And your tone.
You've got to keep it soft
and steady.
- Establish eye contact. Seek his level.
- You want to know the truth, Alex?
- You're the one who really needs help.
- Well, enlighten me, Nick.
Tell me what truth is.
Truth is looking at a beautiful woman
like our Kate here,
and saying to yourself,
"I've got to have that.
"I've got to break her down."
It's your basest animal self.
Dig deep, Alex. You'll recognise him.
He's ugly.
I've run into him now and then.
Go ahead.
Reach for the Glock and take me down
before I tell you about the 10 days
I spent with Naomi.
Ten days, Doc.
Things she'd never tell you.
My brown sugar. Face like an angel.
Perfect. Every inch of her.
You never knew Naomi. Not like I did.
Deep down, you envy me that.
Say it.
I don't work like you.
I don't hate.
You only wish you had the courage.
Good night, sweet Kate.
Kate.
It's all right, Kate.
