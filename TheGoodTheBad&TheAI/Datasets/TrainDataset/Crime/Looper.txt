Time travel has not yet
been invented,
but thirty years from now,
it will have been.
I am one of many specialized assassins
in our present called Looper’s.
So when criminal organizations
in the future need someone gone,
they zap them back to me,
and I eliminate the target
from the future.
Oh la la!
Looper’s are well paid,
we live a good life,
and the only rule is...
never let your target escape.
Even if your target…
...is you.
I'm going to fix this!
I'm going to find him and
I'm going to kill him!
This time travel crap,
just fries your brain like a egg.
