Oh, yeah.
Bloody hell.
I'm sweatin' here.
Roastin'.
Boilin'.
Bakin'.
Swelterin'.
It's like a sauna.
A furnace.
You could fry an egg on my stomach.
Ohh...
Ooh, now that is hot.
It's ridiculous.
Tremendous.
Fantastic.
Fan-dabby-dozy...
...tastic.
Oi. Give it some.
This brush is sick.
It's a good brush,
what's the matter with you?
Don't blame the brush, it's the man.
It's you, it's your technique.
Put your back into it.
Mush!
Yes, sir!
Walking on the beaches
looking at the peaches
Well, I got the notion, girl,
that you got some suntan lotion
In that bottle of yours
Spread it all over
my peeling skin, baby
That feels real good
All the skirts
lapping up the sun
Lap me up!
Why don't you come on
and lap me up
Walking on the beaches
looking at the peaches
Well, there goes another one
just lying down on the sand dunes
I better go take a swim
And see if I can
cool down a little bit
Cos you and me, woman
We got a lot of
things on our minds...
Oi, I don't pay you to flap about,
go and get us a coupla beers.
Walking on the beaches
looking at the peaches
Well, you just
take a look over there
Where?
Is she trying
to get out of that clitoris?
Liberation for women,
that's what I preach
Preacher man!
Walking on the beaches
looking at the peaches
Oh, shit!
There goes the charabanc
Looks like I'm gonna be
stuck here the whole summer
Well, what a bummer!
I can think of
a lot worse places to be
Like down in the street
or down in the sewer
Or even
on the end of a skewer...
Oh, lovely...
Down on the beaches
just look at all the peaches
Down on the beaches...
Down on the beaches
just look at all the peaches
Down on the beaches
just look at all the peaches
Mm-mm mm-mm mm-mm mm-mm!
Mm-mm mm-mm mm-mm mm-mm!
Mmm!
Mm-mm mm-mm mm!
- What's that?
- It's a boulder.
- What?
- A fuckin' boulder.
I've got the fuckin' bends.
How did that happen?
I don't fuckin' know.
Where's the mobile?
I almost got killed, Dee!
I was that close
to gettin' killed. Serious!
You nearly had a squashed husband.
Here, give your mate a call.
- What?
- Your mate, the one with the truck.
- Felipe?
- Yeah, if that's his name.
Don't worry about this, darlin'.
It's nothing.
Come here.
It has done
a fair bit of damage, Gal.
- Cracked the tiles.
- I had noticed!
- When's that gettin' fixed?
- Saturday, apparently.
Wouldn't bet on it.
They're takin'
the boulder out Tuesday
and retilin' on Saturday, I hope.
Oh!
Fuckin' hell!
- Fuckin' thing!
He should be in the circus.
He's a menace.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Oi, Gal.
You gonna stay with
the same colour water?
- What d'you mean?
- Water.
You stickin' with the plain?
You can have different colours.
- Fuck off!
- Straight up!
Aquamarine, deep blue,
mid-blue, tangerine, lilac, pink,
plum, anything you want.
- They've got a chart.
- Is that right?
- Check it out.
- Gal, he's at it.
I'm not! What do you know?
- Just have the fuckin' plain.
I fully intend to!
Now, eat your sausage!
People say,
"Don't you miss it, Gal?"
I say, "What? England?"
"Nah, fuckin' place. It's a dump."
"Don't make me laugh."
"Grey, grimy, sooty."
"What a shithole. What a toilet."
"Every cunt with a long face,
shufflin' about, moanin' or worried."
"No thanks, not for me."
They say,
"What's it like, then? Spain."
And I'll say, "It's hot."
"Hot."
"Oh, it's fuckin' hot."
"Too hot?"
"Not for me."
"I love it."
He ain't gonna hit
fuck all with that blunderbuss.
- Better off with a spear.
- Shut up, Aitch.
Shh!
I'll give you 100 to 1.
Hold up.
Little peach.
It's only a tiddler.
That's his problem.
Prepare to meet your maker.
Cowboy gun? Fucking right,
it was a cowboy gun.
Clunk!
What?
I'm gonna have the calamari.
What you havin'?
I'm not sure yet.
You like mussels, have the mussels.
No, I'll have this chicken thing.
What chicken thing?
I didn't see that.
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm gonna have the calamari.
I'll have the calamari.
Shall we just order? I'm starvin'.
I'm Lee Marvin.
Here they are.
- Hello, babe.
Whatever it is, leave it outside.
That way,
we can have a nice evening.
Jackie... you look beautiful.
Can you get me a brandy, Aitch?
Now, that's what
I like to hear, brandy.
Bloody brandy.
I'll have one of them.
- You all right, Jackie?
- Aitch...
Tell him, then.
- Tell me what?
- Jackie?
Are you definitely retired?
Yeah, why?
- Definitely?
- I'm definitely retired.
What's this about?
Gal, we had a phone call,
just before we left the house.
- Yeah?
- It was from London.
He's definitely retired.
Wait a minute, love.
Now, let me get this straight.
You had a call. The phone goes.
It's a job, right?
- Yeah.
- And they want me?
Yeah.
- No one else?
- No.
- They want me?
- Yeah.
All right. You've asked me
and I've said no. That's it.
So... why are we still talking?
Jack?
It was Don Logan.
- Oh, Christ.
- Don Logan.
Gal, I'm sorry, I didn't know...
- It's all right.
- Why didn't he just call us?
Who knows what goes on
in that cunt's head?
- It's not your fault.
- Shouldn't have picked it up.
All right, right, um...
You tell Don...
Umm... Tell him... thanks.
Thanks for thinkin' of me,
but I've gotta decline.
- No offence, but...
- You can't.
Well, then, tell him...
Tell him...
- I'd be no good.
- They're serious.
Tell him what the fuck
you like, anything!
- You can tell him yourself.
- What?
- Yeah.
- He's comin' over.
Tomorrow.
Wants us to pick him up.
OK.
Seòor.
He rates you, Gal.
Reckons there's no risk.
Oh, that's nice, that. Nice and cold.
I love this restaurant.
Deedee, my lovely wife...
Come Saturday I'll have
me pool back, swim in it.
Always dreamed of that... this.
Guess where?
That's it. You got it right in one.
Inside, that's where.
"No risk."
No fucking risk?
Nine years of my fucking life,
no fucking risk?
What you havin'?
I'm havin' the calamari.
Look, what's the worst thing
that could happen?
He's gonna come here, ask me,
I'm gonna say no.
He's not gonna be happy,
then he'll leave.
- That simple?
- Yeah.
Now, please, come to bed,
I miss you.
We don't have to be here.
Now, that would be
the wrong thing to do.
You know that.
That'd be like a red rag to a bull.
All I can do
is tell him to his face
that I'm not interested,
that's all I can do.
And I'm not.
And I will tell him.
Come here, give us a hug.
He'll hurt you.
No...
He won't.
He won't hurt me. He can't.
You know he can.
Come on. Let's get some kip.
Oi!
Here y'are, sort him out.
He'll have the balance
on Saturday.
Listen, stay away
from here for a bit.
I'm all right for the moment.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gotta change my shirt,
it's sticking to me.
I'm sweatin' like a cunt.
How's your brother?
Malky? He's all right, I suppose.
Dunno, you'd have to ask him.
- You patched things up?
- It's up to him, innit?
- How was the flight, Don?
- Was all right.
So this is a Spanish villa, is it?
Yeah, this is it. The old hacienda.
Bit remote, innit? Cut off.
No, it's perfect, Don.
It's just how we like it.
D'you wanna look round?
Yeah, I will in a minute,
when I have a piss.
Right, girls, you fit?
Where you goin'?
Taking the ladies out to eat.
Leave you two to it.
- Ain't I invited?
- No, Don.
No, no - course you are!
Only I thought you'd want
some time. Talk about things.
No, I'm jokin'. It's all right.
Here y'are, I'll get it.
That's all right, Don.
No need for that.
Aitch! Behave.
I'm payin' for your meal.
Oh, that's, er, very kind of you.
- Very nice of you.
- Shut up.
Yeah, this is all right, innit?
Not bad.
What's that?
- A swimming pool.
- It's a bath, innit?
- We had an accident.
- Accident?
Yeah, this boulder
came rollin' down the hill,
just missed me.
Smashed some tiles. Look.
- You happy here?
- Yeah. Very.
What did Jackie say?
- Just that something was happening.
- Which it is. And?
- You were planning something.
- And you said?
I didn't say much, just listened.
She put a question to you.
- Yeah.
- Which was?
That you thought of me.
To which you said?
She probably told you.
Told me nothing.
- Look, Don...
- Look, Don?
- It's like this.
- Like what?
I'm...
retired.
Are ya?
'Fraid so.
I haven't... not got lots
of money. I got enough.
I'd do anything not to offend you,
but I can't take part.
I'm not really up to it.
- Not up to it?
- No, I'm not.
I see.
- I'd be useless.
- Useless.
- I would be.
- In what way?
In every fuckin' way.
Why are you swearin'?
I'm not swearin'.
I'm gonna tell you a little story.
I know a bloke who knows a bloke
who knows a bloke.
Hello?
Now, you know this bloke.
- Do I?
- This is a bloke you know.
Is that Mr Logan?
- Who's this?
- Hello, Mr Logan.
- Hello.
- What you doin'?
- Watching telly.
- What you watchin'?
Nuffin'. Is that Stan?
Course it is, you cunt.
Stan Higgins.
Wants me to put a team together.
Eight men. Strong.
Ain't afraid of graft.
It's gonna take all night.
Good boys, gotta be good boys.
Reliable. Positive attitude.
That's very important.
Very important.
That's what we're looking for, Don.
Who's behind this, Stan?
Who do you think?
- Who do you think, Gal?
- I dunno. Who?
- Who?
- Teddy.
Teddy?
Teddy Bass.
Mr. Black Magic himself. Teddy Bass.
Months ago,
he gets invited to this party,
massive place on the Bishops Avenue.
Wild party, orgy.
Orgy?
Said it was fucking incredible.
Arses everywhere. Doin' everything.
Wanking, spanking...
Fucking...
Cocaine, camcorders...
Like ancient Rome.
How are you feeling, Teddy?
Are you all right?
Having fun?
Yeah, it's a gas.
What you staring at?
Who's he fuckin' sitting next to?
Who's he fuckin' sitting next to?
Teddy, this is Harry,
chairman of Imperial Emblatt.
Only the fuckin' chairman
of Imperial Emblatt.
Heard of that?
No.
That's cos they're one of those
sniffy lot, don't need publicity.
The back of your head.
What did you say?
I'm staring at the back of your head.
Well, don't. Stare at the back
of your own fucking head.
Like Standard Gradings TMD,
remember them?
Yeah, safety deposits, late '70s.
That's it. Only these are bigger.
Much bigger.
Men or women?
Oh...
definitely.
This chairman's
not such a big prick.
He knows who Teddy Bass is.
What he is, what he's up to.
But does he care?
- Does he, fuck.
- Thank you for that, Harry.
I've been looking
for somewhere safe for that.
It's been in the family
for donkey's years, generations.
Why? Cos the place is impregnable.
The most elaborate
security system in Europe.
Well, thanks, Teddy.
Thank you for choosing us.
It's a modern fortress.
No, it's perfect for me.
I'm well impressed.
I feel very... safe.
Well, rest assured, Teddy,
we're very safe.
Very comforting to know that, Harry.
Nice doing business with you.
See you around.
Tell you what, Stan. That is
fucking impressive, that place.
I'll say that, fucking futuristic.
Yeah?
Doable?
I don't see why not.
See, where there's a will,
and there is a fucking will...
There's a way.
And there is a fuckin' way.
There's always a fucking way.
It's Saturday but you're needed
in London Friday.
It's a bit sudden, innit?
No, it's very far from sudden.
It's been five months,
I've been in on it for two.
It's not sudden. Preparation,
preparation, preparation.
It's a piece of piss, a monkey
could do it, so I thought of you!
Cheers, Don.
You're at the Grosvenor,
your name's Rowntree.
If they give you a pull,
you're just here to see some friends.
Somebody'll call you,
pick you up. Probably Mike.
What's that mean?
- What?
- That stupid nodding you're doing.
Is this a fuck-off, Gal?
No, course not.
- Are you saying no?
- No.
- Is that what you're saying?
- Not exactly.
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying...
Thanks and all that,
thanks for thinking of me,
but I've got to turn
this opportunity down.
No, you've got to
turn this opportunity yes.
- I'm not match fit.
- You seem all right to me.
- Not really.
- You look fine.
- Do the job.
- What?
- Do the job.
- No, Don.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
- I can't.
- Can.
- I can't.
- Don't do this.
- Do what?
- What am I doin'?!
- This.
This? This what?
- Come on, Don.
- There's a boy lookin' at us.
Go home, son. Go on.
I don't need you today.
Go on, go home.
Go home!
Who was that?
A Spanish kid who helps
around the house. Nice kid.
D'you wanna go into town for
a drink? I'll show you round?
If you like. I'm not fussed.
You're on two per cent,
maybe even three.
Depends on the usual bumflufferies.
It's not about money with us, is it?
It's the charge, the bolt, the buzz.
The sheer fuck-offness, right?
Dance to the music
like nobody does
The first time I saw you
I knew it was love
Groover...
She's all right, Jackie, isn't she?
Yeah, she's great. Great laugh.
Big tits.
Yeah, she's a lovely girl.
My heart is on fire
the night is divine
My only desire
is making you mine...
I've missed my plane,
I'm staying tonight, that all right?
Course.
I fucked her.
It's none of my business.
I know, I'm just tellin' you.
Three years ago.
Oh, yeah?
- Dirty cow.
- Yeah.
Aitch knows fuck-all about it.
What's she doing with him,
lanky hunk of piss, fucking pillock.
He loves her, Don.
I'm tempted to tell him.
She tried to stick her finger
up my bum.
I almost hit the roof.
What d'you make
of a woman who'd do that?
Listen, don't say nothin',
Gal, but I...
- I quite liked her.
- Did ya?
Mmm.
How is she, all right?
- What's that, Don?
- You heard.
No, I didn't, Don. Sorry.
Yeah? Well, I'm not repeating it.
How far's the sea?
Talk to me, Gal.
I'm here for you.
I'm a good listener.
What can I say? I've said it all.
- I'm retired.
- Shut up!
Cunt.
You louse. You got some
fuckin' neck. Retired?
Fuck off, you're revolting.
Your fuckin' suntan,
you're like leather.
Like a leather man.
You could make a fuckin' suitcase.
You look like a
fat crocodile, fat bastard.
You look like fuckin' Idi Amin.
State of you.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Who d'you think you are?
King of the castle? Cock of the walk?
Oof!
You think this is
the Wheel of Fortune?
You make your dough and fuck off?
Thanks, Don. See you, Don
Off to Spain, Don. Fuck off, Don.
Lie in your pool laughing at me,
d'you think I'll have that?
You think I'll have that, ya ponce?
All right, I'll make it easy.
God, you're fucking trying.
Are you gonna do the job?
It's not a
difficult question. Yes or no?
- Don...
- Say it.
No.
Yes. Fuck off, wanker,
you're doin' it.
You know what I've noticed, Gal?
What stands out?
You haven't asked about anybody.
Everyone asks after you
"How's Gal? Heard from him?"
"No, not for a while."
"Is he all right?"
Leaves me wondering,
"Have I upset him?"
"Must have, I'll ask him."
Have I upset you?
- Course not.
- Meaning?
Well, you haven't.
You're British,
not a fucking Spaniard.
Don't kid yourself...
What's that?
It's a goat.
They're a fucking nuisance.
What's it lookin' at me for?
God, the steak was enormous!
Size of it. Couldn't finish it.
And he were nice, weren't he?
The waiter.
Oh, yeah. Very attentive.
He liked you, Deedee, didn't he, Dee?
- Liked you.
- He's got good taste.
Handsome, weren't he?
Bloody Adonis.
Wasn't expensive...
You sound nice on the phone, Jack.
Nice telephone voice.
Sound like you work in an office.
- You ever worked in an office?
- No.
No?
Nice telephone voice.
I've worked in an office.
I was 17.
Does that surprise you?
What, that you were 17?
You got very nice eyes, Deedee.
Never noticed them before.
They real?
I'll get us all a drink, eh?
I'll give you a hand.
- He's staying the night.
- Have you told him?
Have you told him?!
- Yeah.
- And?
It's not that simple.
Did you know he fucked Jackie?
Yeah.
What the fuck was she playing at?
This is a fucking nightmare.
He's a fucking nightmare.
What happened?
What'd he say? You told him?
He knows.
Shouldn't have told him that.
Shouldn't have said anything.
Where? In the bar. About Jackie.
Jackie the Paki.
What, Gal? He's all right?
Still, giving too much of
yourself away. Fucking mouth.
Best keep schtum.
Schtum schtum, quick quick, schtum.
Big mouth
fucking big mouth Don, Don, Don.
You all right, mate?
Don't look it.
Someone taking the piss, are they?
Liberties?
What? That cunt through there?
What's he said to you?
It's all right, mate.
You can tell me.
He said that?
Just like that? No...
That lump of shit said that?
Expects you to take that?
What, does he think you're a cunt?
I'll sort him out for you,
shall I? It's not a problem.
Can't have that.
Get up, you cunt!
- Lazy bastard!
- Get out of our room!
Get out, Don.
Get out!
I'll be downstairs.
Unh... unh...
