They got body bags at the door.
Okay.

Body bag?
Man, I don't know about that shit.

These niggas.
DJ YELLA: I just wanna say this.
You should be a model.
-
- Yeah, you look like a model.
Just sayin', you know.
I look in your eyes and I see a Capricorn.
You're a Capricorn, right?
I mean, I can look at a girl
and I know their sign, you know?
It's just something I do.
Uh... Mmm-hmm.
DJ YELLA: I hope I'm not
disrespecting you, right?
- Uh-huh. Not at all.
- Good.
- Yella!
- Good.
Lonzo coming, man.
- DR. DRE: Nah, nah. Weak at the Knees.
-Huh?
DR. DRE:
- Hey.

LONZO: I'mma go outside and make sure
nothing's poppin' off, all right?
I want you to keep these fat asses shakin'.
Don't play none of that
street-ass rap shit, ar'ight?
I want these motherfuckers
to think about pussy, not pistols.
- Yella!
- Huh?
I saw you talking to my lady, man.
Keep your motherfuckin' hands to yourself.
DJ YELLA: All right.
Man, why you always fuckin'
with Lonzo's girl, man?
Why not?
I can't be afraid
of a grown man in high heels, Dre.
DR. DRE: Cube, you up.
He 'bout to come
and bust a little rhyme for y'all.
Here's a little
somethin' 'bout a nigga like me
That I'm a crazy mutherfucka
from around the way
You don't like how I'm
livin' well, fuck you!
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no
About drinkin' straight
out the eight bottle
'Cause I'm tha type of
nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me
I'll put my foot in your ass
- Fucking right! I told you. I told you.
- Yes, you did.
That's what I'm talking about, man.
Now, see, I'm this close
to firing your monkey ass.
What, you trying to start
a riot up in here?
I told you. Didn't I tell you I don't want
that hardcore shit played in my club?
As soon as I turn my back,
you do that shit anyway.
I'm just trying to help
your business out, Lonzo.
You saw they went crazy for that shit.
Don't worry about my business, ar'ight?
You just remember,
the only reason you up on that stage
is 'cause I put you up
on that motherfuckin' stage.
Now, you a badass DJ, I'll give you that,
but you don't like to listen, Dre.
And I get tired of arguing all the time.
'Cause you know,
there's a lot of cats that'll come in here
and they'll play exactly
what I want 'em to play.
Like that shit right there.
Cats that understand that you don't
bite the hand that feeds you.
Now you take a backseat
to that shit, nigga.
These fucking marching jackets and shit.
LONZO: Marching my ass. You march
your ass and do what the fuck I say.
-
- DJ YELLA: Hey, Dre.
Don't even trip on him, homie.
Nigga ain't got no fucking vision, man.
That's why I'mma fuck his bitch.
After he leave.
Not with that shit on.
How you liking this little spot? Hey!
Dr. Dre.
-
- Wassup, E?
It's been a minute, man.
I love your jacket, by the way.
- You baggin' on me.
-
You know I don't like wearing this shit.
That's Lonzo's shit, man.
You know it's part of the gig.
Yeah. You remember
the homie Ren from Kelly Park, right?
- Wassup?
- Wuddup, Dre?
- Wuddup?
- Wassup, man?
EAZY E: Look, I heard you been, um,
spending some time at your auntie's house.
How's the couch life?
It's fucked up.
- I'm too tall for that shit.
-
Plus I got my woman and baby livin' there.
It's hard, man.
But you know,
everybody can't do what you do.
Yeah, Dre. Well, what I do
gettin' played out quick, man.
Motherfuckers just getting locked up
and laid down out here, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.
- I gotta make some changes.
Changes ain't bad.
I'm thinking about
making a few changes myself.
Whatcha mean?
Whatchu think about
dumping some money into this music shit?
Look, I got some ideas.
DJ YELLA:
Fuck! I gotta get back up there.
- That's your calling, man.
-
Tell Lonzo I said, "Fuck him." Ar'ight.
DR. DRE: Hey, E.
Think about it.
Ar'ight.
TYREE: Wassup? Do I know you?
MAN: What?
- Get 'em up.
- Hell no!
Hey, don't be fuckin'
with my little brother, nigga!
What the fuck did he do?
Nigga lookin' at me
like he know me or somethin'.
Man, I told you about this shit!
- COP: Clear the parking lot.
-I told you to go the fuck home.
The fuck wrong with you, man?
-
- You better chill the fuck out.
One time.
Hey! We told everybody
to clear this parking lot!
We just standing here.
COP: Get outta here!
What's going on?
COP: Hey! Head home.
I fell.
You fell? He fell?
That's what he said.
I didn't ask you what he said.
Get the fuck home!
I am home.
Head home. Go!
If you don't start walking...
Or what?
Turn around. Hands on your head.
Come here.
You have the right to remain silent.
Stop resisting, boy.
You already know what it is.
- What up, sucker-punch?
- You already know what it is.
Sucker punched that dude, man.
Hey, man, nah, nah, nah. That was Tyree.
You know he got that temper and shit.
Always getting me into
fucking trouble, man.
So what they lock you up for?
I was literally just standing there, man.
That's it.
As far as they was concerned.
That's the gangsterist
shit I heard all week.
Man, it's stupid.
But I was thinking about what you
was saying last night, though, man.
Oh, yeah? And?
It's interesting.
How long?
Really, like, how long do you think that shit
you doing out there gonna last?
'Cause it ain't no happy endings
in that game, man.
You saying a lot for a nigga
who just got bailed outta jail.
I'm just saying, if you can slang dope...
- Nigga!
- What, man?
Just tell the whole fuckin'
world I sell dope.
Yo, yo. You can slang dope,
you can slang records, man. It's easy.
You got a mind for that shit, E.
So whatchu talking about doing?
Lil' homie from last night?
Nah, man. He in a group.
You know, they a trip, but...
But that shit, the reality raps,
that's what I'm talking about, man.
That's it.
My boy, D.O.C.,
he coming in from Dallas, dope.
My little homie, Ren, rap too.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, look, I got these cats,
H.B.O., Home Boys Only
from New York, dope voices, man.
Some whack-ass lyrics, though.
I'm saying, Cube,
he wrote this shit for 'em, it's crazy.
Shit, we could probably
do something with that.
That's what I'm saying, man.
Start a label or something, man.
A label?
That's kinda fucking far-fetched, Dre.
Yeah, but check this out,
what would you call a
record label like that?
Ruthless.
Ruthless?
- Just like these fucking police, nigga.
- Ruthless.
Let's get the fuck from around here.
Trying to get me sent to jail.
Get your simple ass in the car.
What the fuck is "gankin"?
And what's a "6-4"?
- Yeah.
-It's a car. A 6-4 Impala.
"Ganking" is when you jack somebody, man.
It's not a big deal.
The shit just sound better.
Yo, man, it's too much
cursing for radio play.
I mean, besides, who gives a fuck
about Compton anyway? Right?
Hold the fuck up. Hey. Hold up, man.
Hey, y'all got something
to say about Compton?
'Cause we might have a problem
up in this bitch.
Huh!
'cause I'm really losing my patience,
ar'ight?
Stop fucking embarrassing me, man.
Yeah, man. Fuck this shit.
- Fuck this Jheri curl rap bullshit, man.

Fuck you! Wearing a Kangol

What the fuck you gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do, mark-ass nigga?
Hey.
MAN: Let's roll, B.
B-street-looking motherfucker.
MAN: Fucking Jheri curl ass.
Keep talkin' that bullshit
on your way out the door, nigga.
Well, there goes the talent, Dre.
Shut the fuck up, E.
- I'm saying...
- Come on, man.
How the fuck we suppose
to make a record label and hit records
and we ain't got no talent?
I mean, you said, hold up my side of the deal.
You said, put some money up.
So, it's time for you to deliver.
Why don't you do this shit, E?
DR. DRE: Nah, for real.
Get in there on the mic.
You ain't got shit to lose.
It's your money. You paying for it.
No, I can't. 'Cause I'm not a rapper.
There's your rapper.
ICE CUBE: I'm in a group already, man.
Jinx and them
would trip on me if I do anything.
EAZY E: Look, I understand
that you wanna keep throwing your life away
with Jinx and the backyard
boogie band or whatever...
But I'm the Berry Gordy of this shit.
So, whenever y'all figure out
what y'all wanna do,
just let me know.
Come on, man.
Look, the song is about you, E.
Eazy-motherfuckin'-E. I'm telling you.
DR. DRE: Come on, man.
You the only muthafucka with a 6-4.
- You got a 6-4?
- I don't have a car.
You got a 6-4?
I got a po' Porsche, man.
DR. DRE: Nigga, come on, man.
You ain't doing nothing.
DR. DRE: But you the business man,
so, you know.
It's on you.
We got a cool-ass song, though.
I think you could hit that shit.
I'm not sold, Dre.
Whatchu mean, you not sold?
You just gonna sit there?
You're kinda being a ho right now, Eric.
- Fuck y'all, niggas.
-
ICE CUBE: Berry Gordy to save the day.
EAZY E: I ain't scared.
- You ain't scared?
- What's up then?
DR. DRE: E, let me produce. Man.
Man, shut up and get comfortable.
Let's go.
TOGETHER: Shit.

- For real?
- Yes, man. Come on.
You know what? Whatever. Whatever.
You motherfucker.
- Come on, E.
-You finished, Dre?
You wanna laugh too?
I stay in this bitch by myself.
Hey, just say the words, ar'ight?
What does that even mean?
Man, just say the shit with me.
Ar'ight? Cruisin'.
Dre, you know this shit

A'ight. You trying to be funny.
But, you see how you said that shit, right?
Like you believe it.
Then say this shit like

and you cruisin' down Crenshaw
in a motherfuckin' 6-4.
Come on. Say that shit like you believe it,
man, like it's your words.
That shit was dope, man. Yeah.
Now we only got 59 more lines

This whole reality of rap

Now you need to get back in there
and work on that slow jam that we worked on.
And I'm serious

my time and that's coming outta your pay.
No disrespect, Eazy,
'cause I know you real.
But you, motherfucker,

Wrap this shit up.
DR. DRE: Yeah. Okay. You got it.
No, you got it!

You told me, man. I should've believed you.

I thought it was exceptional.
- Exceptional?
- Yes.
Fantastic.
Please, just sit down, all right?
We'll start this again. Come on.
All right. I'm gonna try this again. Okay?
All right.
As a music manager,
let me tell you what I can do for you, Eric.
I will make you legit.
It seems as if I could
do something for you.
I see. You think because
I don't have some flashy office
I don't know what I'm talking about?
I worked with Elton John.
I worked with Otis Redding.
Let me see.
I worked with War. I worked with Styx.
- I worked with, uh...
- Have you worked with anybody this decade?
Okay.
Let me tell you what I see here, Eric.
A lot of raw talent, a lot of braggadocio.
Bravado. Uh...
But if you think anyone's
gonna talk to you,
you think anyone
is gonna let you in the building
where somebody might listen to you or talk
to you, you think that's gonna happen?
You're crazy, man. I'm sorry.
That is what I can do for you.
I can make you legit.
I can get you in that building.
And I will protect you.
I will block out all the noise
of this crazy fuckin' business
and we can build something big.
But you gotta believe in me
the way that I believe in you.
The way that I believe in this,
because you have a unique talent, Eric.
Very special.
Don't fuck around.
But, you know what?
If you can't handle it,
if it's too much fuckin' pressure
for you, then fine.
Get outta here.
Wait. I'm listening.
You got more music for me?
- Absolutely.
- Good.
'Cause you are gonna
have to follow this up, quick. All right?
Now, what does N.W.A stand for, huh?
No Whites Allowed? Something like that?
Nah.
Niggas With Attitudes.
You're fucking kidding me.
All right. We can work with that.
- Good. I like that. I like that a lot.
- You better.
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
What up, what up? What's up, fam?
- Hey.
- What's up, baby?
Dre.
Hey, fellas, y'all got any idea
why I asked y'all to
wear all black tonight?
'Cause we a all-star group.
And to be a all-star group
we gotta look like it,
sound like it, dress like it.
You mind tellin' me
what the fuck happened in your situation?
Man, kiss my ass.
This the only clean shit I had left.
EAZY E: That's saying a lot
about how you live.
Are we getting paid to wear all black?
Look, I ain't lookin' out for your ass

Hey, that's good, Ren.
Y'all finished?
This man been out there
shopping our stuff around
trying to get money for Ruthless.
He tryin' to get us distribution.
He tryin' to get us on tour.
He could probably bring some real money
- to the table...
- Okay.
- So let's take this shit serious.
- Okay.
And then what, E?
All he do is take 20 off the top.
We cut 80, but that's how managers work.
Fellas, all right. I'm sorry I'm late.
How's everybody doing?
I'm gonna be honest with you.
We've had a lot of passes.
Uh, people are scared of you guys.
Big time.
They think that you're dangerous.
Uh, I happen to think
that that's a good thing.
These fucking guys,
they need some more convincing.
They're so fucking timid.
So I invited them here to the show.
So you've got to kick ass tonight.
- Can you do that?
- Hell yeah.
They're gonna be here.
Scare the shit out of them.
Blow the fucking roof off, all right?
Have a good show.
Hey, can this motherfucker
Jerry Heller bring in more pussy?
'Cause that shit's worth 20 percent.
Hey, man. But, for real though.
They want N.W.A, let's give 'em N.W.A.

Somebody say "Do that shit
Do that shit, do it"
All right.

these motherfuckers tonight, boy.
The stage was shaking so much I thought
my needle's about to jump off the record!
Yo, I was trippin' off them knowing the words,
though. That shit was crazy.
Hey, y'all, I'm telling you,
Compton is definitely on the map, yo.
- Damn right.
- That's for damn sure.
Man, I figured you were gonna represent

Wuddup? Whatchu been up to?
You still out there in Vegas?
- This is Suge.
- What's up?
Man, I just been back and forth, man.
Doing some security bodyguard work.
If y'all need my services, let me know.
Security?
I don't think we gonna need
no bodyguards, man.
We might got that covered.
But you never know
what you need until you need it.
Look, I just came here to give y'all props.
I got people waiting on me.
JERRY: Excuse me.
Uh, okay. That was
- one hell of a show.

Nice job.
Very, very nice, gentlemen. Outstanding!
You kicked ass, yeah.
You definitely did. You definitely did.
Okay, this is Eazy-E and N.W.A, obviously.
Guys, this is Bryan Turner.
- How you doin', fellas?
- Ice Cube.
- Pleasure.
- Bryan runs Priority Records.
And he wants to sign you.
BRYAN: Yeah, immediately.
Fellas, I got to say, I loved the show.
All right?
What you did with that crowd out there,
I mean, I've never seen anything like that.
So, I think, honestly,
if y'all wanted to, you guys
- would fit perfectly with our label.
- Yes.
That'll work.
Nah, nah, nah, nah. No, it won't. Nah.
Well, hold on, man.
I mean, Priority Records.
I've never heard of it.
I mean, what you got?
Like, is it Def Jam?
Like, the Beastie Boys? You know?
Run DMC? You know what I'm saying?
Or is it more R&B?
You know, Prince, Michael Jackson.
- It's, uh, a little more...
- More that end of the spectrum.
- More R&B as of right now, but...
- Yeah.
Yeah, we represent nothing big,
but mostly R&B.
DR. DRE: Who dat?
It's, uh, California Raisins.
Who?
BRYAN: It's the California Raisins.
The raisins from the commercial singing
"I Heard it Through the
Grapevine" and shit?
Yes, Cube, the little-ass raisins.
- BRYAN: That would be the one.
-
JERRY: Hear it out.
Don't get ahead of yourselves, okay?
I was laughing, too,
I promise, then I started cashing checks.
So, look, I gotta tell ya,
those little fuckers, they went gold last year.
- Gold?
- Almost platinum. Yeah.
What do you say, fellas?
You wanna go make a record?
I mean...

He seriously dug it. He really dug it.

Fuck it up.
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about, man.
But you hear the difference, right?
Yeah, way better than the shit

Excuse me, gentlemen.
I thought you'd like to know

Contracts right here for you to sign.

- Music keep sounding like this,
this album is gonna be incredible.
Well, you're welcome, Jerry.
Very strong lyrics too, Cube. Very strong.
- Appreciate that, Jerry.
- Mmm-hmm.
So what's up with our contracts, though?
They're getting done right now.
Lawyers are drawing 'em up.
Jerry on top of that,
but did you just switch all the straws?
Yo, Dre. There's something outside
you need to take care of.
Right now. Trust me.
- Serious.
-
Uh-oh. Really?
- We can split that.
- Cube. Right there, hush.
- Not this time.
- You know what I got for you.
So let me get this straight.
You gonna do this right here, right now?
What am I supposed to do?
We're sleeping in a twin bed
at your auntie's house.
We have a baby, Andre.
You expect me to wait
for what you doin' in there?
And you in the streets fuckin' around?
- Are you crazy?
- What?
I'm out here bustin' my fuckin' ass
day and fuckin' night
tryin' to create something.
You gonna come up in here talkin' about
some fuckin' bitches? Are you crazy?
- You don't get it.
- No, you don't get it, Lavetta.
Daddy!
It's all right, baby.
Chill out, man.
Tyra, it's gonna be okay. All right.
- All right, baby?
- Bye, Dre.
Daddy love you.

Get on the ground!
On the ground?
What am I supposed to do with this?
Get on the ground.
What we do?
Get down! Get on the ground, now!
Get your punk ass on the ground. Let's go.
Get the fuck down.
Hands behind your back.
Interlock your fingers.
- DR. DRE: This is fucked up.
- Interlock 'em!
The fuck you got us
on the ground like this for, officer?
For our protection.
There's seven of you and four of us.
So sit tight and let us do our job.
JERRY: Hey, officer, I'm sorry.
What is going on out here?
Sir, can you stay right there, please?
We're trying to check these bangers,
make sure they're clean.
All right, I'm sorry,
these are not bangers, okay?
These, um... These are artists.
- Excuse me. Artists?
- Yeah.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
- What kind of artists?
- Rappers.
And they're working with me
in the studio right now.
Well, see, rap is not an art.
And I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm the manager.
Well, you're wasting your time,
Mr. Manager.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- You're wasting your time.
- Really?
- These clients of yours, these rappers...
- Yeah.
- They look like gang members.
You can't come down here and arrest people
just because of what they look like.
What, are you crazy?
But, that's police harassment.
- You said you're a manager, right?
- Yeah.
- Not a fuckin' lawyer.
- JERRY: Does that matter?
You cannot come down here
and harass these guys
- because they're black! People have rights!
- Calm down.
Step back! Step back!
I'll step back, you let them up.
Get up, guys.
Come on. Eric!
- You don't tell them to get up.
- Get up.
- I'm stepping back.
- We will decide that.
You have no idea the people I know.
I'm gonna call the Mayor's office.
Step back.
Now get up.
Get up, now!
Okay. Come on, guys.
And you keep your people in line,
you understand?
And the fuck out of Torrance.
- JERRY: Good. Come on, guys.
- You got a problem?
DR. DRE: It's my jersey.
You ain't tough now, huh?
JERRY: Eric, come on. Let's go.
- You got a problem?
- Yella.

You got something to say, boy?
Cube. Get inside. Let's get back to work.
You heard what your master said.
Get inside, boy.
You shut the fuck up!
Hey. Get the fuck back inside.
Get inside, Cube.
We're gonna go back and work. Okay?
Leave us alone. You know, leave us alone.

EAZY E:

MAN 1: Yo, Dre.
MAN 2: Hey, Dre.

GREG MACK:  1580 KDAY.
This is Greg Mack of the Mack Attack.
I gotta tell you,
you are witnessing history.
LA's first super group, N.W.A,
with their new album Straight Outta Compton,
BRYAN: Are you going
out there with them or not?
No. I had enough of that shit in the '70s.
But I'm gonna fly out there a bunch of times,
and I'm gonna check on them.
Can you just make sure
that everything goes smooth, please?
Of course.
I've got enough bad press
with Tipper Gore and the PMRC on my ass.
I know. It's a good contract.
- Getting ready to get outta here, guys.
- Excuse me. What's going on?
What do you have in that bag?
Oh, this right here?
Just a little of the shit
I was selling in Reno.
- Oh, fuck, put it down.
- Are you kidding me?
Are you fucking nuts?
Jesus, Eric. Are you out of your mind?
- What?
- You can't take that on the bus.
How am I supposed to protect myself
when I'm out there on the road
riding through Texas and fucking Tennessee
and shit where they lynch niggas?
- You got me?
- I got you, okay?
I'm not gonna let you take
an arsenal on tour, Eric.
Use your fucking head.
Jerry, look, just take care
of the business, a'ight?
And I'm gonna make sure
everything else good.
A'ight, look... Otis, get the bags.
Put them on the van.
You feel better? We're not even riding
with them no more, Jerry.
- Unbelievable. Jesus Christ.
- No, no, no, do not put those on the...
Bryan, it's fine. It's fine.
I got it under control.
I swear to you, okay?
DR. DRE:
CROWD: Yeah!
DR. DRE:

Yo, it's obvious,

CROWD: Eazy!
MC REN: Easy!
DR. DRE:
CROWD: Eazy!
DR. DRE: A little louder
Say it!
CROWD: Eazy!
DR. DRE:
Gangster rap has become
incredibly popular and profitable
by selling lyrics about violence
to a young mainstream audience
that wouldn't dream
of going anywhere near a ghetto.
Not all music stars,
as you know, are model citizens.
That's certainly nothing new,
but now a few musicians
MAN:
MAN:
- Yella.
- Hmm?
You in there watching porn
with the door open?
Yeah.
Yo, that's what I said, man.

Fuck y'all, man. I'm back here tryin' to write.
Fuck y'all, man.

ICE CUBE: This shit is crazy.
DR. DRE: Yeah, man. This shit is dope.
DR. DRE: No, man. No. I gotta go.
All right?
TYREE: Yo, you gotta let me

Okay. So now you try and partake
into some of those fat asses?
Come on, bro, I'm tired of these same...
Man, I need something new.
DR. DRE:

'Cause you know you got school,
and you know she ain't gonna
let you miss that many days, man!
- You did.
- DR. DRE:
Hey. Hold on. Hold on.
- So, look, how Mom doing now?
But, nah, you know her,
constantly working, man. Every day, man.

I'll call you when I'm on the way to Miami,
see about getting you on a flight.
TYREE: I can come out there, though?

-You promise?
DR. DRE: I got you. I got you, ar'ight?
Hey, bring the rubbers, T.
- Get off the phone.

I still got the same ones

- Hey, hey. Hold on, T. Somebody at the door.
-
Here.
Hello? Dre?
DR. DRE: Hold on!
Yeah, nigga, I'm lookin' for my girl,
Felicia.
I heard she was up in one of these rooms.
Ain't no Felicia in here, nigga.
Mind if I take a look?
DR. DRE: Get the fuck outta my room, man.
This nigga just came
to my motherfuckin' door strapped, man.
Where are you going?
DR. DRE: I'll show that nigga strapped.
DR. DRE: Hey, where Felicia at?
- Where Felicia?
- Where's your homegirl.
MC REN: You Felicia?
DR. DRE: Hey, Felicia. You Felicia?
DR. DRE: Felicia? Her dude here.
DR. DRE: All right.
So none of y'all are named Felicia now. Okay.
Yella! Hey, Yella!
DJ YELLA: Your name Felicia?
- You forgot my name?
- No, wait!
- DJ YELLA: Valerie. Your name Valerie.
- Whatever.
Felicia! Girl, your nigga's out there.
She's suckin' dick, though.
He got guns, girl. Come on!
DR. DRE: The nigga is strapped.
I'll show this nigga right now.
Talkin' about gettin' strapped.
Hey, Ren.
Nigga outside talking about gettin' strapped.
Watch out, man.
DJ YELLA: Hey!
EAZY E: Show wassup now.
Talking about gettin' strapped.
EAZY E: Hey, Cube, you got me, man.
MC REN: Let's ride, nigga.
Time to go to work.
EAZY E: Hey. Y'all looking for Felicia?
She in there or what?
She kinda preoccupied
with some real nigga dick.
The fuck you say, little nigga?
I said, she got
a motherfuckin' dick in her mouth, nigga.
ICE CUBE: That ain't fun no more?
DR. DRE: The fuck y'all going?
DR. DRE: Nigga, she's trying to compensate.
Wow!
EAZY E: Fat niggas was bullshit!
DR. DRE: Punk-ass niggas, man.
ICE CUBE: Bitch-ass niggas.
Y'all wild.
EAZY E:
Nigga runnin' so fast, that shit was crazy.
D.O.C.: Don't let that shit bother you.
EAZY E: Tryin' to get me killed?
FELICIA: Whatever.
EAZY E: Nigga, ain't tryin'
to take no bullet for no bitch,
I guarantee you that.
- ICE CUBE: Bye, Felicia.
-
You're flying up
the  200 albums chart.
R&B and hip-hop charts too.
You have any idea
how many records we're selling?
Ruthless has arrived, Eric.
We're fucking huge.
That is dope, Jerry. That's dope.
The combined law enforcement
associations of Texas today
I believe that the rap music
promotes violence against authority
and, consequently, violence
against law enforcement.
- DR. DRE: 15 on that.
-
ICE CUBE: Man, fuck, man!
MC REN: Hey. Come on, man. Put that shit up.
JERRY: Excuse me. Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news.
EAZY E: What you got?
Oh, shit.
DR. DRE: What's that?
Motherfuckin' FBI.
What the fuck?
I'm supposed to not care about this?
Wait, the FBI? They comin' after us, too?
JERRY: Kind of.
I mean, what the letter say, Jerry?
JERRY: Uh, basically, uh...
"A song recorded by the rap group N.W.A
"on their album
"encourages violence
against law enforcement.
"Advocating violence and assault is wrong,
"and we in the law enforcement community
take exception to such action."
MC REN: Fuck that.
DR. DRE: Fuck that.
Fuck the law enforcement community.
We got freedom of speech, man.
- What the fuck can they do to us?
- DR. DRE: Right.
You wanna provoke 'em and find out?
Because this is a warning, Cube.
And it's about Fuck Tha Police,
in particular, so...
I think maybe we should not
play that song right now.
Not play what? Fuck that, Jerry.
That's what the song is about.
JERRY: Relax, relax.
We're not giving in to anything.
No. No.
I just say we retire it for now, okay?
It is a reasonably worded threat.
This isn't street bullshit.
This isn't the Crips and Bloods and crap.
This is the federal government.
These guys can come after us
a million different ways.
I don't even want to think about it.
Why provoke them?
The fuck does that mean?
If it was the LAPD,
maybe I'd be a little worried,
but we can't let them censor us, Jerry.
- I'm not advocating for censorship, Cube.
- EAZY E: Wait. Wait.
Maybe none of us should be worried.
Maybe we should be happy.
- What you mean, E?
- ICE CUBE: Dunno about happy.
EAZY E: 'Cause you see,
this right here is a gift.
It's the FBI, E. Whatchu talking about?
EAZY E: This is free publicity for N.W.A.
We take this to the press and we show them
what type of intimidation,
discrimination, and harassment
that we dealing with from our government.
DR. DRE: I like that shit.
ICE CUBE: I'm with that.
- JERRY: That's a different thing.
- My nigga, I feel you.
- If that's what you wanna do, then we can...
- That's what I wanna do.
That's what we wanna do, Jerry. That's it.
That's what we wanna do.
Okay.
DR. DRE: Yeah?
EAZY E: You good?
I mean...
- Hate to be the bearer of bad news...
- JERRY: Mmm-hmm.
- But 20!
- 20, man!
Wait a minute, that ain't 20.
- Hey, hey, hey. Shhh.
- DR. DRE: What's up?
Let's not get thrown out
of another fuckin' hotel.
N.W.A: Goodnight, Jerry.
WOMAN PROTESTOR: Compton's crap!
MALE PROTESTOR 1: Go back to Compton!
ICE CUBE:
Speak a little truth
and people lose their minds.
MALE PROTESTOR 2: This is not music!
Shit, the truth is,
they can do whatever they want with 'em.
They bought them motherfuckers.
Like to be funky
Nickname Eazy-E yo eight ball junkie
Crowd-rocking motherfucker
from around the way
Police on my balls
I had to pause
40 ounce in my lap,
and it's freezing my balls
For the sake of our children,
I implore each of you
to be unyielding and inflexible
in your opposition to drugs.
JERRY: 'Cause another one called me
and told me she's pregnant by you too.
You just got to slow down.
You can't fuck every broad on the planet.
EAZY E: So now, pussy a problem?
Listen, it's gonna be a problem
if you got 4,000 kids.
- Right?
- EAZY E: Yeah.
You make some money,
you got all these problems.
You're gonna have to take care of 'em.
It's fine.
I'll help you take care of 'em.
- Hey, Cube.
- Sorry to interrupt y'all lobster brunch.
But what's up, E? Where the contracts at,
man? You forgot about me?
Didn't I tell you to... You know what?
Jerry, you want to deal with this?
ICE CUBE: I'm not talking to Jerry,
I'm talking to you.
EAZY E: That's Jerry's job.
JERRY: It's my department.
You're absolutely right to ask, Cube.
The contracts are being
finalized as we speak.
The thing is,
with these attorneys, they'll take forever.
Pouring over it, they'll bleed us dry.
But, they're gonna get done.
I wish I got paid by the hour the way they do.
You know?
Me, too.
I just want to know what's goin' on
since I did write a lot of lyrics on this record.
Everybody knows
how important you are, Cube.
They do?
That's what's goin' on.
We just need some time, that's all.
Everything probably all right.
I must be trippin'.
Shit tastes pretty good.
Someday, right?
Y'all enjoy your meal.
JERRY: Okay.
I'm telling you, that guy wants
to be you very frickin' badly.
As if I ain't got enough fucking problems.
Excuse me. Can I get a refill?
At some point,
you just gotta trust somebody.
You know?
You gotta trust somebody.
DR. DRE: Nah, I just think
you overreacting, man.
Eazy one of us, Cube.
What you thinkin' don't even make sense.
No, what don't make sense is
Eazy and Jerry eating steak and lobster
and we eating Fatburger.
Shit don't make no sense.
Look, I hear you,
but I think we need to ride this wave.
For real.
Don't be jumping to conclusions
until you know for sure.
-
- You know?
It's my moms, man.
DJ YELLA: Yo, Dre,
what's going on?
Moms just called, man.
It's Tyree.
He's dead.
DJ YELLA: What? No.
DR. DRE: He got into a fight,
some motherfucker broke his neck.
It's my little brother, man.
It's my little baby bro.
I never told y'all this.
But when I was 12, my sister got killed.
Her own husband killed her,
then killed himself.
This dope gang took my cousin too.
Shot him in the trunk of a car.
Fucking Compton, man.
DR. DRE: Come on, man, like...
It's my fault, man.
DJ YELLA: Don't talk like that.
This never would've happened
if I had him out here, man.
D.O.C.: Come on, Dre.
It's my fuckin' fault.
It could've happened in another way.
- You can't blame yourself for that, Dre.
- No.
Tyree gonna always be with you.
No matter what.
ICE CUBE: That's right.
D.O.C.: Yeah, for real, man.
And we always gonna be with you.
MC REN: Hell yeah.
We always gonna be brothers.
Fuck.
EAZY E: We here, a'ight.
DJ YELLA: I'm sorry, man.
ICE CUBE: You good, Dre.
VERNA:
If I had just brought him on tour with me.
Like he wanted.
Stop this nonsense now. Stop it.
Your brother looked up to you,
and you took great care of him,
we both did.
It's time to let someone else
take care of him now.
I'm proud of you.
OFFICER: No person shall disturb the peace
by participating or abetting

or abusive language in a public place.
Note also, the performance of the song
"F the Police", will not be permitted.
Refusal to abide

Are we finished here? We got a show to do.
Just watch yourself.
ICE CUBE: Eat a dick.
It's "Fuck tha Police."
EAZY E:
So what about the bitch
who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn
about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!
Word to the motherfucker
Straight outta Compton
CROWD:  Eazy! Eazy!
What's up?
DR. DRE: Let's do this shit.
- What's up?
- Let's do this shit.
- Wassup? Let's go.
- What's up?
ICE CUBE: Y'all know
what the motherfuckin' police
CROWD: What?
They tried to tell us
what the fuck we can't play.
- DR. DRE: What up?
- I got something to say.
ICE CUBE:
For a punk motherfucker
with a badge and a gun
We can go toe to toe in
the middle of a cell
And on the other hand,
without a gun they can't get none
'Cause they'll slam ya
down to the street top
And when I'm finished,
it's gonna be a bloodbath
CROWD:
Huh? Fuck!
Come on, nigga.
Hell no! They shootin'! Let's go!
Go, go! All units, move in.
DR. DRE: Move!
DJ YELLA: Move!
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, man!
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!
ICE CUBE: Hold up, hold up.
MC REN: Let's go, let's go.
- Fuck them!
- Come on!
ICE CUBE: Fuck!
Shit, shit, shit, shit!
DR. DRE: Fuck this!
MC REN: What we gonna do?
ICE CUBE: Get off me!
Get the fuck off me!
Man, get off me, man!
OFFICER: Away from the ledge.
OFFICER: Backup!
We need backup in the loading area!
Now!
Man!
Come on. Get the fuck off of me, man!
Fuck y'all.
This is completely fucking illegal!
You realize that?
Let us go! Let me go! Come on, man.
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Come on.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
OFFICER: Get in there!
You gotta get in there.
Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police!
CROWD: Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police!
Fuck your mama,
fuck your daddy, fuck your grandma!
Fucking...
These motherfuckers.
D.O.C.: Fuck y'all!

JOURNALIST: How do you explain
inciting a riot in Detroit?
What do you have to say about that?
I have to say that we
didn't incite that shit.
Right. Like, y'all just got a snapshot
of how Americans really feel.
We gave the people a voice.
We gave the people truth.
Yeah, but your songs, they glamorize
the lifestyle of gangs, guns, drugs.
Our art is a reflection of our reality.
What you see
when you go outside your door?
I know what I see.
And it ain't glamorous.
We get AKs from Russia
and cocaine from Columbia.
And ain't none of us got a passport, so...
- ...might wanna check the source.
-
ICE CUBE: Next question.
Will you be more careful
about what you say, how you say it?
- No!
- Probably not. Nah.
ICE CUBE: Freedom of speech
includes rap music, right?
Well, we exercising our first amendment
as far as I'm concerned.
And the government wrote that.
So, Cube, what's a guy from Compton
do when he starts making
real money like this?
Cube?
- Buy Raider gear.
-
- And curl activator.
-
Next question.
JERRY: Good to see you, Cube.
I can barely see you, Jerry.
What's with all the  shit?
Okay.
I know that you've been very eager to sign
a contract with Eric's company,
Ruthless Records.
Eric's company? Ain't it your company, too?
That's incorrect.
It's not my company. I work for you.
- You work for me?
- Uh-huh.
I've made that clear from the beginning.
All right, cool.
So, I could take this to a lawyer
or somebody, right?
Cube, those guys are paid to make trouble.
They're gonna create problems
where no problems exist.
Jerry, you know I don't know
what none of this legal shit mean.
All right? None of us do.
So we're gonna need a lawyer
before we sign anything.
Everybody else has already signed.
I thought you knew this.
You're the only one who hasn't.
There's also this.
$75,000.
Shit!
Sign the contract
and all this money is yours.
That's my money anyway, Jerry.
I earned that money.
- And I wrote a lot of hit songs.
- Mmm-hmm.
We've been performing
on this tour for months.
Sellin' out shows, sellin' records.
- I know there's plenty of money.
-
Really? Jesus Christ.
Give me my money, Jerry.
How the hell do you think this works?
How the hell do you think
all of this gets paid for?
The hotel rooms, the tour buses,
security, the parties, all this shit.
How do you think it gets paid for?
You think it's free?
Why are you doing this now?
If we were so good, why didn't you give us
contracts in the beginning?
Because nothing is a sure thing, Cube.
Even a great talent can crash and burn.
Too much ego, too much excess,
too many expectations.
It tends to ruin things.
You ought to keep that in mind.
This is Eric's company, right?
Bye, Jerry.
I'm out.
D.O.C.: What up, big Suge?
BUS DRIVER: Here you go.
DJ YELLA: Thank you, sir.
EAZY E: Hey, what up with D.O.C. and Suge?
DJ YELLA: I guess that dude
is gonna be managing him now.
DJ YELLA: One day
you Bobby Brown's bodyguard,
and the next day, you reppin' talent.
MC REN: Come on, man.
I guess everybody
wanna get into the act, huh?
I guess so.
All right, man.
DJ YELLA: I know, right?
JERRY: How you doin'? You good?
BUS DRIVER: Here you go.
I'm helping you out all I can.
You all right?
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm good.
- JERRY: What's going on?
- Just happy to be home.
JERRY: You hungry?
JERRY: Yeah?
I'll be there in a minute. All right?
Thanks, man.
- Thanks for everything, bruh.
- You bet!
DR. DRE: So, Cube.
We gonna keep
this momentum going or what?
Nah, man. Not like this.
I'd rather be broke than to get fucked.
I told you not to sign that shit, Dre.
Nigga, I got bills to pay.
And you know that.
And I gotta put some money
in my momma's hand after Tyree passed, man.
- I feel you.
- Right.
We gotta do what we gotta do.
They're gonna take care of you.
You their bread and butter.
Cube, we Ruthless.
We N.W.A. They Ruthless.
Cube, you comin'?
I'm about to get out of here.
Take care of yourself, Dre.
Peace.
- Mom.
- I missed you.
- How you doing?
- I'm good.
- Good.
- Come on. Let's get home.
All right.
So you're leaving the group?
Yeah, I'm through with the bullshit.
Eazy put everything on Jerry,
Jerry put everything on Eazy.
It's a two-man show up there.
There ain't no fuckin' group.
I get that,
but I just want you to understand
that you are walking away
from a winning situation.
Now, how do you feel about this, Kim?
Is he making a big mistake?
- A mistake?
- BRYAN: Yes.
I don't think so, okay.
After hearing all the stuff
that he went through, I would've left too.
Look, I want you to express yourself, Cube.
And I am your biggest fan.
I believe in you.
But I just want you to understand,
there's not a lot of
money in this solo play.
Okay?
But if the first record hits,
I will make it up to you on the second one.
Be ready, Bryan.
These records is comin' in fast.
That's why I'm sick
of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild
I never tell you to get down,
it's all about coming up
When I'm rolling real
slow and the lights out
Shooting out the window
of a drop-top Brougham
The police, the media,
suckers that went pop
Put 'em overseas
they'll be begging to come back
EAZY E: You know Cube's record
is in the Top 20  right now?
Our shit never been up there.
He blowin' the fuck up, Jerry.
JERRY: It's gonna be fine, Eric.
It's not just N.W.A anymore,
it's our whole Ruthless roster.
We got D.O.C.,
we got Michel'le, we got Above the Law.
We're moving up to the next level.
You know what? Sit down for two seconds.
Look, we need to keep Dre happy.
Yeah.
Look at him.
You think he needs
any more motivation than that?
EAZY E: I mean, I get it, Jerry.
He drownin' in pussy and shit,
but that don't mean that he...
Now, you worry too much. Stop, okay?
Yeah, ar'ight.
Here, sign some checks.
- Right now, Jerry?
- Yes, right now.
- You're gonna be out of your mind later.
- Come on.
Do it now.
The fact is,
Ren is as good a writer as Cube.
Maybe even better.
We got everything covered.
Just the last one. Okay?
- We finished here, Jerry?
- We're finished.
Good. 'Cause I'm about to go fuck.
- Ar'ight.
- Yeah.
Now I'm only telling you what you told me.
If  blew up,
you'd pay me the advance for the follow-up.
Now is that not what the fuck you said?
That is what I said.
But it is more complicated than that, Cube.
Right, there are metrics...
Come on, Bryan!
I got a baby on the way
and a house I just paid for
off the strength of what you told me.
I mean, you gave me your word!
Cube, would you just calm down?
Calm down?
I am just trying to give you what you want.
You not. I been did the work...
I gave you the product.
Give me my money, Bryan!
When a man does the job,
he's supposed to get paid,
and you making it seem like I'm beggin'
for some shit that's technically mine.
Of course you are not begging.
And I am not trying to be difficult, man.
I promise you.
But you can't help me, right?
That's what you telling me?
My hands are tied, man.
BRYAN: Hey!
Shoulda kept your word, Bryan.
Jesus Christ, man!
What the fuck are you doing, Cube?
Goddamn!
I will get you your money, man.
Just... God damn it!
You think I give a fuck
about these fucking records?
I put up these fuckin' records!
This my shit!
I know that, Cube!
I will get you your money!
God damn it! I'm sorry.
Now I'm gonna fuck up your shit.
Look, do not...
God damn it!
Just, fine.
Take it out what you owe me.
Just...
MC REN:
Yo, you shoulda covered
your muthafucking head like an ostrich
And your ass up high
so I can kick the muthafucker
'Cause my foot will be so
far up your ass, you'll get hemorrhoids
See that shit right there?
That's what I'm talking about.
Fuck that nigga Cube, man.
That nigga ain't shit.
How you figure, man?
His record the hottest shit out right now, E.
Yeah, man, for real. Cube killed that shit.
So we supposed to
just sit there and not say nothin',
and look like bitches and just take it?
Take what?
I don't know what the fuck you talkin' about.
I like that shit.
Clown-ass.
Why you drunk all the goddamn time?
You need to get your shit together.
You's a motherfucking' artist,
if you ain't noticed.
How about you get
your shit together, little nigga.
Come on.
How about you get
your country-ass homeboy.
'Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs
And not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggaz pick up your record
Hello.
SUGE:
What? An accident?
D.O.C. shouldn't even be alive.
Got thrown out a car, hit a tree.
Is he paralyzed?
He could lose his career over this.
Where your people? Where Eazy and Jerry?
How the fuck should I know?
Come here.
Whatchu know about Jerry?
Whatchu think about him?
He a'ight. I guess.
What about your paperwork?
You cool with that?

You think?
Look, I just focus on the music, Suge.
That's it.
You see that motherfucker in there?
Gotta make sure it don't

Hey, uh...
Maybe some of your people
can look into my paperwork, too.
Most definitely.
I'll arrange.
Go see your boy.
WOMAN: This place is nice.
You're nice.
I figured I'd take you to a nice place,
- Ms. Record Executive.
- Mmm.
Um, record executive assistant.
But, damn.
I didn't realize we was going on
like a "date" date.
I don't even know how to take that.
I got my collared shirt on.
I brought you to this nice restaurant. Really?
Okay. That is not the
kind of collared shirt
- they was talking about.
-
It's cute, though.
And you didn't take off
your hat like they asked you to.
And I'm not.
- Oh, really?
- I ain't taking off my hat for nobody.
I think they know that.
So what?
You bring all your little
females here, don't you?
The special ones.
Okay.
I'm playing. I'm playing.
There you go getting sensitive.
You don't have to try to impress me.
We could've went to Fatburger.
Go to Fatburger?
BRYAN: Hey! You got a haircut. I love it.
How's that new house treating you?
KIM: It's great. Thanks for asking.
So, how you liking your new decor?
Great.
Yeah, I never did like
the old design anyway, you know?
What you got for me, Bryan?
I know you called me up here for somethin'.
Yeah.
Uh...
It's N.W.A's new record.
I wanted to play it for you first,
before you hear it anywhere else.

Un-fucking-believable.

Jew-bashing bullshit!
You know what?
I'll call my friend at the JDL.
They'll handle him.
We'll see how much he likes that.

anti-Semitic means anyway.
It's just a fucking battle rap.
Come on, Eric, we gotta get organized.
We got to fight this kinda
ignorant fucking bullshit.
You know what? I always knew

This is just ignorant shit.
He calls it political?

- JERRY: Did you hear what he said?
- I heard what he said!
About you? About me? Come on!
You got your way
of dealing with it, I got mine.
We could just go the studio

I don't know about all that.
Fine, you do that.
You call Dre, and you guys go do that.
Do something!
Damn, E. Who work for who?

PETER JENNINGS: We've all seen the pictures
of Los Angeles police officers

against some of the men.
At least we got the motherfuckers on video.
LAPD gonna have a real good time
on that level three prison yard.
You know what I'm saying?
JERRY: Dre, maybe we should
try to get back to work.
We are working, Jerry.
I'm having a word with my client.
Man, hold up, man! We got this!
Nah. We got it.
You done? Suge?
Jerry? E? Huh?
REPORTER: Brutality and misconduct
that goes back a quarter of a century
including one incident
that sparked the Watts Riots.
So far this year,
there have been more than 125
SUGE: Yo, Dre. Hold up.
Look, I did what you asked me to do.
I had my people look at your contracts.
It didn't look good.
But you gotta watch your back.
What you mean by that?
Look, everything you need to know is here.
And you know I can help you with this.
May I help you with something?
This your house?
Who's asking?
It's a nice house.
Who are you? You're with Suge Knight?
Someone else? Ice Cube?
Have yourself a good night.
Jerry.
Shit.
EAZY E: So, wassup?
When you talked to me on the phone, man,
you sounded pretty worked up.
Yeah, I know you don't
like hearing this shit.
It's about Jerry.
We gotta get rid of that motherfucker, E.
That's really why you came here?
I thought all this shit
was in the past, Dre.
I found some real shit, man. And the shit's
been happening since the beginning.
I had some people look into this.
I ain't been gettin' my fair share.
Do you even know why you rich, though?
Do you know why you got
a big-ass house and you
ain't sleepin' on your
auntie's couch no more?
Because Jerry made that possible for us.
He kicked down the door
for that shit to happen. For us!
And you just gonna turn your back on him?
What, you Cube now?
Cube was right, fool!
E, look at the papers, man,
and you'll see what the fuck I'm talking about.
And forget about Jerry, man!
You keep talking about Jerry this, Jerry that.
We didn't make it because of Jerry,
we made it because our shit is dope!
And we can keep going, E.
We can own the goddamn world,
but we just can't be fucking with him no more.
Man, we started this N.W.A shit.
I just want it to be right.
And this what you think right?
Turnin' your back on somebody
after all he done for us.
You mean all he done for you.
Right?
Look at me.
Look at me.
When Tyree died,
you said we was always gonna be brothers.
I guess you forgot about that.
I'mma start my own company
with Suge Knight, E.
Thought we were brothers, man.
What up, Dre?
This Death Row. We about to do this shit.
This shit sound good.
Yeah. None of it means anything
while I'm under contract with Ruthless.
I told you about that.
I'mma get you outta your contracts,

Yeah, yeah.
So, look, I listened to your demo.

You see that little look he gave me?
Yo, yo, yo, hold up.

Snoop D-O-double-G, cuz. Who you?
What? What up?
What the fuck you say, Blood?
Hold on! Hold on, hold on.
He with me. He with me.
He ain't with me.
Nah! He here to work, ar'ight?
This is business, Suge. Come on, man.
Anyway, what's this
you workin' on, cuz, I like this.
So look, you know...
It's a new track for this new movie.
It's called
- Woo-wee.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- For a movie, huh?
- Yeah, a movie.
Dre doing big shit. Okay, okay, okay.
You think you can get down on it?
Oh, most definitely.
Throw me in the booth one time.
All right.
ANCHOR: It's perhaps the most notorious
police brutality case in recent memory.
Those blows from
Officer Powell and Officer Wind's batons
They just let them people do
whatever the hell they want.
Rodney King's leg
and facial bones were broken.
Three of the four accused officers took
the stand and admitted that it was brutal,
but said, "Police work is brutal."
And that the video tape only showed that.
- Here.
-
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
You watchin' this shit upstairs?
Hello?
Why you don't talk to
Jerry about that shit?
I don't wanna talk to Jerry.
It's your company. You the man.
Ar'ight. Whatever, man.
I'll be through there.
- Who was that?
- Nobody.
splitting his face
from the top of his ear to his chin.
Where Dre at?
You said he was gonna be here.
I'll get with you outside.
Don't worry about Dre.
Truth be told,
he got nothing to do with this.
This what's gonna happen.
You gonna sign these,
releasing Dre and D.O.C. from Ruthless.
Whatever, homie.
Think I'm signing that?
You crazier than I thought you was.
I'm out.
Get your ass up.
Nah. I think you're gonna
stay here for a while.
Fuck you, Suge!
Y'all niggas don't scare me.
You can talk tough all you want,
but this ain't no record.
Don't make me change you, Eric.
Fuck that's supposed to mean?
Keep talkin',
you're gonna fuck around and get smoked.
SUGE: Nah, nah.
But you better choose right.
You know where the fuck I'm from.
This Bompton, nigga.
Oh, my fucking God.
Eric.
Jesus Christ.
What the hell are you doing here?
You can't sneak in here like that.
I thought you were...
Oh, my God. What's going on, man?
Are you okay?
What happened to your face?
I gotta kill this motherfucker,
Suge Knight.
I just came here to let you know,
'cause shit might get a little thick.
I need to stay protected.
No, you're not gonna do that. No.
I didn't come here to ask for permission.
I came here to let you know.
You wanted to be involved
with this gangster shit?
Here we go.
You do that and you're gonna ruin
everything we've worked for.
You really think I got a fucking choice?
Look at my face!
This the streets. Motherfuckers came at me!
Came at us!
If I don't hit back, we finished.
It's over.
I'm not saying that we're
not gonna hit back.
But this is not Compton,
if you haven't looked around.
Drop that shit, okay?
We don't hit back with bullets,
we hit back with lawyers.
We drain these assholes.
That really takes 'em down.
It ain't about the money, Jerry!
I don't care about no money.
Of course it is. And you should
fucking care about the money.
You're so much smarter
than these fuckin' thugs.
You wanna kill somebody?
You're gonna go to jail forever.
No more family,
no more Ruthless, no more anything.
If you kill this man,
his problems will be over
and yours will just be beginning.
Don't be a fuckin' fool.
Hey.
Why the fuck I gotta be the bigger man?
'Cause it's better than
you being a dead man.
I don't want you fuckin' dead.
You okay?
Baby. Let me see.
- Why you so tense, Dre?
- No, I'm cool.
Man. No, you're not, man.
You've been in that house, what?
A month now?
Nigga, and not one track?
I mean, what's up?
There's too much interference.
Man, you know how they
tryin' to starve me out.
Playin' games with
my motherfuckin' money, man.
That's why the house
was so goddamned empty.
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'm fucking with you, cuz. Hit this.
- All right, man, give me that shit.
- Here.
Fuck I'm taking about.
Have you feeling righteously together.
- Holy shit.
- Oh, hell no. Give me that.
Goddamn, man!
What the fuck is in this shit, Snoops?
- That right there, that's that chronic, cuz.
- Yeah.
- Chronic.
- Yes, sir.
- Let me hit that once.
- Yeah.
- Look it.
- Wow, man.
- All right. Let's head back to the studio.
- Let's go.
I got something for this.
Damn, Dre.
What the fuck is that? Feeling that shit.
- Yeah. You feelin' it?
- Yeah!
Hey, hey, look,
I'mma spit a little something.
You feel me? You say whatever...
You just jump in, nigga, and just...
Hold on, look, I got something. Here we go.
Un-fadable so please
don't try and fade this
JOURNALIST: I want to thank you
for having us here.
- ICE CUBE: Of course.
- Very generous for you to give your time
with everything that's going on right now.
Not a problem.
Now if I may,
are you anti-Semitic?
Now, I thought
this was about the Rodney King trial.
Well, the JDL recently got involved
citing the lyrics about
your former manager Jerry Heller.
I'm not anti-Semitic.
I'm anti-Jerry Heller.
Let me ask you something.
Do the JDL condone Jerry's behavior
when it comes to my situation?
Him trying to get me to sign a contract
without legal representation?
I have no idea.
I didn't think you did.
But when you got that for me,
we can continue on this topic.
Until then, I'm here to talk about the
beating of an unarmed motorist, Rodney King.
And four guilty LAPD officers
who seem to be Daryl Gates' standard issue.
It's also the LAPD and the FBI
who feel that your negative portrayal
of police condones violence.
"Fuck Tha Police" is just a warning,
that's it.
You can't treat people like that
and expect 'em not to rise up.
I'm a journalist just like you.
Reporting what's goin' on in the hood.
The only thing that's different
is that I'm brutally honest.
What's your relationship
with the Nation of Islam?
ICE CUBE: They my brothers.
You know what?
That question right there proves to me
what kind of a unprepared
sandbag reporter you are.
You talkin' to me
like I'm some elected official.
Like I'm running for office.
But I get it, that's your job.
Bigger the story,
the bigger the check in your field of work.
It's not your fault, I shouldn't blame you.
What's your name, man?
Brian.
Eat a dick, Brian.
Get the fuck out my house. Y'all done here.
Can we cut, please?
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.
You look like you ready to go.
Yeah. I'm just waiting on my friend.
I should've drove.
You're not havin' a good time?
No! No. I had a really good time,
but now it's starting to get a little wild.
Yeah.
We've been known to get crazy
from time to time.
I'm Andre.
I'm Nicole.
Come on, man. Lighten up.
We're about to get back in the game.
Big time.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
How do you figure?
Are you trying to piss me off?
Come on. God almighty.
Did you forget about Ren's new album?
Or did you forget about the fact
that you are working on something
I think is gonna be bigger
than anything N.W.A ever did.
All I know... Mmm!
Fucking Cube out here,
- doing it big. Making movies and shit.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Then I keep hearing about
this album Dre about to drop.
Dre is a fucking producer, Eric.
Producers don't rap.
We have him under contract.
He can't do anything.
Cheer up.
Eat, drink and be merry.
- Suge.
- Hey.
- How you doin'?
- All right.
Jimmy Iovine, Interscope Records.
Nice to meet you.
You, too.
JIMMY: So, what do I call you?
Dre? Dr. Dre? Doc?
Nah, Dre is cool. Go ahead, have a seat.
All right.
- It's good.
- Yeah.
So what do you got today?
DR. DRE: Um...
Well, you know...
I heard John McClain gave you my album.
What'd you think?
I think it was great.
So, you're the artist on the record.
Who produced it?
I did.
Okay. And who mixed it?
Come on, man. I did.
Huh.
Listen, um...
I don't know anything about hip-hop,
but I know that this is special.
Seriously.
Thank you.
SUGE: Hey, look, we'd love
to bring in Interscope,
but there's a little problem.
What's the problem?
SUGE: Ruthless, lawsuits,
and contracts.
How about this?
You give me three weeks
and I don't wanna hear any bullshit
about you shopping this
anywhere around town.
If you do that...
I believe I can solve your problem
with the contract.
SUGE: Lil' nigga, you in my spot.
- Yo.
- DR. DRE: Hey, Suge.
MAN: Suge. Easy, man. Yo.
Hey, Suge, what the...
DR. DRE: Hey. Suge.
You parked in my
motherfuckin' spot or what?
- I didn't know, man.
- It's cool, man.
What the fuck? Suge!
Suge, it's just a parking spot.
Fuck off. Fuck out of my...
SUGE: Move this piece of shit.
And park my car.
And I better not see
one drop of blood on that motherfucker.
Suge, let's go, man.
What?
The jury in the Rodney King case
has delivered its verdict,
seen on video tape
beating Mr. King a year ago
For Christ's sake. Oh, my God.
Peter, it was a clean sweep
for the defendants.
Only on one count against
Lawrence Powell...
I'm sorry.
...on excessive use of force
under color of authority.
OFFICER 1:
OFFICER 2: I think it was devastating
to the image of this city
WOMAN: It looks
kind of like we're in a war zone though.
REPORTER: We've got some courageous
shop owners here, who are armed...
MAN: Anarchy is obviously
a statement of political dissatisfaction.
REPORTER 1: Police officers
are still back down,
guarding the area
down there with the Ralph's...
REPORTER 2: The police
are using eerily reminiscent
REPORTER 3: You can hear
random gunshots as rioters...
REPORTER 4: The cars
have been left abandoned
REPORTER 5: ...our city.
We have fires burning.
-
- REPORTER 6:
mostly in the South-Central
section of Los Angeles.
You know, If we bag all this shit up in ounces,
we should probably be straight.
I think we got enough.
No, turn it down. Turn it down.
Baby. Can you smoke that shit out there?
So, all this weed is for
your Ruthless artists?
Yeah, I mean, shit.
I'm tryin' to take care
of these little money problems, man.
So, they can smoke it, sell it.
Fuck, throw a party on it,
for all I give a fuck.
As long as I just...
MC REN: Yo, man, you straight?
- E, you straight?
- Yeah, I'm good.
- No, for real, man. You straight?
- Man, I'm good!
I'm just fucking tired, man.
I'm fucking downgrading houses.
How would you feel?
Answer me that!
Dre rolled out. Ruthless money low.
Tomica asking me all kind of questions
about the house.
Answer me this, would you be all right?
Would you be all right
moving out your fucking house?
You all right with it?
E, I'm your boy. I'm in this shit with you.
I'm just trying to make
sure you're good, bro.
I'm good! You good?
- You good?
- DJ YELLA: Yeah, man.
JERRY: Eric.
What, Jerry?
Take it easy.
You know what?
Let's get you outta the house.
I have stuff needs your autograph, okay?
I'll come when I have time, Jerry.
JERRY: Eric, come on.
We still got a business to run.
Don't it look like
I'm running business right now?
JERRY: No. It looks like
you're fucking cutting up weed.
I thought that was a job
for fucking jackasses.
You know what, Jerry?
You right. You absolutely fuckin' right.
We got business to take care of.
I'll see you in a minute.
You all right, E?
E, are you cool?
- Eric.
-
"You got knocked the fuck out."
That shit's funny.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.
How's  coming?
This shit is funny. I'm feeling it, though.
What page are you on?
Baby, come here. Look!
Look how young y'all are.
ICE CUBE: Shit.
Dang!
What?
We left a lot of good records on the table.
EAZY E: It's like
I don't even know what I'm doing no more.
I don't know where the money going.
TOMICA: Why you stressin'?
You know I know the business.
Just... Shit.
Lay out all the files,
contracts, whatever it is,
and I'll look into it.
For real. Come here.
Come here.
You just go to New York,
you take care of this
big ol' distribution deal with Sony.
Bring that shit on in.
All right?
And I'll check into everything else.
I love you.
You what?
I love you.
- You what? I can't hear you.
-
So how's your home life, man?
What? That small-ass house
I just moved into in Norwalk?
-
- Fuckin' hate it.
No, come on. You know what I mean.
I mean your love life, Eric. Hmm?
You seem pretty serious about this girl.
- I ain't in love.
- Oh? You had me scared there for a minute.
You're too young to settle down.
Well, you don't have to be scared of that.
Oh, man. Wait till you taste this.
Kung Pao chicken.
Fantastic.
And it is better the second day.
There you go.
Dig in.
So, where is this girl from again?
Look, Jerry.
I actually ate right before I came.
So I'm just gonna take this and go.
Hold on. Hold on. Where are you going?
I just came to get this.
These are my bills, my checks.
Look, I'm gonna have a bite of your food.
I'm gonna say farewell.
- I'll talk to you later.
-
Your neighbors,
they've been complaining a lot.
The noise.
- Stop.
-
I just think a little
privacy would be better.
So what? You want me to move?
Yeah.
And I...
You know, I happen to know of a place.
There's plenty of room,
and I know the owner.
Are you sure you're ready for that, Andre?
Yeah, I am.
'Cause I'm really feeling you like that.
I'm really feeling you too.
But...
Hey, don't even worry about it.
It was just a thought.
What's up?
All right. Good night.
Oh, whoa, whoa! Really? Good night?
You okay to drive?
No. Look at you.
Good night, Andre.
Nah. See...
See, I can't help thinking,
maybe you want me to come inside.
Of course I do.
So, what's different now?
I got a lot to think about.
You're asking me to move in with you.
That is a huge step!
I like you, Andre,
but there's a lot going on around you.
Whatchu mean?
I know about the whole Death Row business,
the assault charges,
the shooting.
Just seems dangerous.
My son is my world.
I hear you.
Good night.
Revenge is like
the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded
Wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness
in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God
Hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggas coming for me
and my diamonds...
-
- What up, Dre?
What up, Pac?
I'm about to bust niggas in the mouth
with this new album.
Okay, I feel that.
- Suge said you got some heat for a nigga.
- Hell yeah!
- Play that for him.
- TUPAC: Okay.
DR. DRE: Yeah. You feel that?
Yeah. Fuck with me.
- DR. DRE: Yeah.

- MAN: What the hell was that?
Hold on, Pac.
Stay right there, man.
MAN: Yo. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

MAN: Stop, man! Stop.
DOG HANDLER: Chop, chop.
Get him. Get hype.
Get hype.
Yo!

DOG HANDLER:
Get him. Time to eat. Who's hungry?
You hungry, nigga? Yeah!
- Get up.
- DOG HANDLER: Come on!
- Bring your bitch-ass up.

DOG HANDLER: Tight-whitey ass nigga.
You know what to do.
I'd like to make a toast.
To what?
MAN: To Death Row Records...
MAN 2: Death Row!
MAN: ...and Suge
for making all this happen.
And may the West Coast reign forever.
Come on. Come on.
And may the West Coast reign forever.
Now toast to Dr. Dre.
Put your glass down.
I said, put the fucking glasses down!
Hey, yo, slow your roll, Dre.
Come on.
This why we got money?
To act like we ain't got no goddamn sense?
We coulda did all this dumb shit
back in Compton!
But this what the fuck y'all turned into.
You sittin' up here eatin' fuckin' crab.
Who the fuck are you? Huh?
This my motherfucking name
on the wall, man!
And y'all in here acting like
y'all on motherfucking vacation.
I got Pac in the next motherfucking room.
Grindin', man! Workin'!
And y'all niggas in here partyin'?
One time?
- You trippin'.
- WOMAN: That's right.
We can do anything we wanna do.
We started this thing. This is us.
Nah, nigga. Death Row, that's us.
I don't know what the fuck this shit is.
Better watch your mouth, Blood.
And who the fuck you talking to, huh?
Nigga, you ain't nothing but a producer.
Get the fuck out my face!
SUGE: Shit!
Dre.
This is bullshit.
SUGE: Dre!
-
-
-
- Always fucking with me!
OFFICER IN HELICOPTER:
Driver, hold it right there.
OFFICER 2: Hold it right there.
WOMAN: Hey, that's Eazy.
MAN: Wazzup, E! I didn't know that was you.
EAZY E: Hey, wassup? Wassup, homie?
MAN: Hey. Yo, wuddup?
Nah. Hold up.
Hey, hey. Hold up. Relax, homie.
We in a club.
Cube, I just heard you was over here.
Yeah, I'm here. Whatchu need?
Everybody to calm the fuck down
from the looks of it.
I mean, I was just in
the neighborhood, man.
I came here with Bone Thugs.
I was just coming to say wassup.
Wassup?
I saw  It was good.
You ain't called that shit
a after school special?
I like after school specials, Cube.
You know that.
BOTH: What's up, man?
How you feel? You good?
Hell yeah, nigga, I'm good.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you right now.
Look at you!
Pull your fuckin' homies off me then
if it's good to see me.
ICE CUBE: You had niggas jump us.
EAZY E: God damn!
How you go from selling rocks
in the dope house
to having dinner
in the White House with the President?
They still trying to figure that shit out.
But, hey, all publicity...
BOTH: ...is good publicity.
You know it.
ICE CUBE: You know that's right.
EAZY E: Man.
Look, man, I wish that dumb shit
really would've never
popped off between us.
We shouldn't have
dissed each other in the first place.
Making the fans choose between us?
That wasn't cool.
You right.
You ever think we'd be that big, though?
Hell, no.
I was just talking to my wife about that.
How it was in the beginning.
Shit, we just wanted to do music
for the neighborhood.
Be ghetto stars.
But what if we had the chance
to find out how big we can really be?
Come on, man. You got my mind workin'.
EAZY E: I've been thinking
about that shit all the time.
If we could just take that shit back to '89.
We changed the world!
I hear you.
It was a simpler time, you know?
It was hard then.
But I've had days
where I almost wish
we was gettin' arrested in Detroit again.
- Shit. You know?
-
Shit ain't gotta stop there.
But if we go do this,
we gotta do it right.
And if Dre with it, I'm with it.
But I don't know your
relationship with dude.
But if you want me, Eric,
Jerry can't be there.
All right.
Hey, man.
EAZY E: Shit!
ICE CUBE: It's 'cause you
ain't got them damn gloves on.
Man, whatever.
But I hear you.
Yeah?
Shit. Ar'ight.
TOMICA: These invoices haven't been paid.
They're two or three years outdated.
These are cancelled checks.
They all bounced.
And these are past due.
Jerry took advantage of you.
I know it's a lot,
but you had to know the truth sometime.
Now you do.
You know Dre and Cube
tried to warn me about this.
I've been fuckin' up for a long time.
Don't. Don't.
Real long time.
Shit.
JERRY: Hey, man.
Where you been?
I've been calling you all day.
Sit down, Jerry.
What is this all about? The groupie?
The executive assistant?
She even go to college?
Man, you're so much fuckin'
smarter than this.
Sit down, Jerry.
This ain't about Tomica, Jerry.
It's about you.
And you can stop acting
like you ain't never done nothing wrong.
You know what, man?
I know that you're upset. I understand.
But I'm asking you,
I'm advising you, take a breath, okay?
I'm gonna look at the paperwork, Eric.
- You can stop giving me advice as of now.
- It's fucked up.
Here's what's about to happen.
I'mma get N.W.A back together,
and you ain't gonna have
nothing to do with it this time.
How the fuck can you even say
something like that?
What the fuck is going on with you, man?
I know what's good for you,
I know what's good for Ruthless...
And we have worked up a trust
after years of hard work,
and that trust is our foundation, Eric.
- I don't give a shit.
-
Eric?
You look lousy, man. Are you okay?
Trust?
Trust is a motherfucker.
Is it?
Let me ask you something.
Eric, if what I'm doing is so illegal,
how come I've never been sued?
If I'm such a fuckin' thief,
such a liar, such a motherfucker,
how come nobody's ever come to collect?
Because this is business
and this is how it works.
And it's not always pretty. No.
Do I cover my own ass?
Do I cover my own end? Absolutely.
But don't you dare fuckin' tell me
that I have not taken care of you.
Don't you fuckin' tell me
that I have not had your back from day one!
Day one!
Is this taking care of me?
Are you fucking kidding me?
It's taking care of the
whole fucking thing.
It's business!
And this is how it works.
Have I covered my end?
Do I cover my ass? Absolutely.
But don't you dare fuckin' tell me
that I have not taken care of you.
This business, too?
Yes! This is business.
This is how fucked up it can get.
But I didn't start this.
I didn't fuck it up.
You did!
No.
You did.
You fired, Jerry.
Oh, for Christ...
Eric, this is not how we do things.
This is not you.
This is not you.
Eric!
This is an important company.
Eric, I'm not gonna let you fuck this up.
Eric?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Eric!
DR. DRE:
Wuddup, Dre?
- Who this?
-Eric.
E?
What's up?
Killin' all this pussy.
How about you?
I'm just making tracks. Doing my thing.
Yeah, that Snoop joint you did was crazy.
That was dope.
Yeah? Thanks, E. Good looking out, man.
Look, Dre, I know you be busy,
but I talked to Cube and we were talking
about some possibilities.
Possibilities? Okay.
without Jerry Heller
type of fucking possibilities.
Well, it's about time.
Man, I mean, I know shit kinda went crazy.
You know, the money
kinda had everybody divided, man,
but I really wish it didn't.
To be honest, man,
I'm not proud of all the shit I did either.
So, whatchu think, man?
You think we could get together or what?
Whatchu think?
Yeah, man.
Yeah, that sound good.
Let's do it, E. Let's do it.
I'mma let you know when we can get back
into the studio, you know?
Lay down some tracks like the old days.
Fair enough.
It's good to hear from you, man.
A'ight.
Man, y'all niggas
ain't making no music in here.
Hey!
'Sup, E?
What up? What up? What up?
Yo, hey, when are Dre and Cube
gonna roll up in here, man?
- MC REN: Yeah, man.
- I'm ready!
MC REN: 'Cause I'm ready
to get this new shit going.
I'm ready, too.
But long as we stay ready,
we gonna know we go beyond, man.
You already know
this new N.W.A shit about to be crazy.
Here ya go, baby.
E, I got books of new shit.
I got libraries of new shit.
EAZY E: That's what I'm talking about, Ren.
That's what I'm talking about.
I got the tracks. You like that?
Hell yeah.
'Chu think you Dre now?
DJ YELLA: I'm trying to murder Dre.
I'm about to murder both of y'all
on the track, though. Check me out.
Check me out.
DJ YELLA: What you doing, E?
You know you don't play no instruments.
You gonna play it?
E, you all right?
TOMICA: Eric.
Baby, you good?
Yeah. I'm all right.
TOMICA: Eric! Eric!
MC REN: Call 911.
TOMICA: Eric! Baby?
MC REN: Eric. Get up, man.
TOMICA: Get him up.
MAN: Yo, call 911. Call 911.
MC REN: You all right, E?
TOMICA: Baby? Eric?
- MC REN: Eazy, wake up.
- Eric! Baby.
MC REN: Open your eyes.
DJ YELLA: Yes, we need an ambulance.
Wait... Ain't you gonna say something?
What is it? A respiratory infection?
Pneumonia? What?
Yes, well, um, it is those things,
and more, I'm afraid.
We ran a full blood battery, and, uh...
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright,
but you've tested positive for HIV.
Get the fuck outta here.
What?
A normal T-cell count
is anywhere between 500 and 1,500.
Right now, your T-cell count is 14.
But I ain't no faggot.
DOCTOR: Mr. Wright, actually,
the virus can be transmitted
in quite a few ways,
including unprotected heterosexual sex.
That's wrong.
You got to test that over. Test that again!
We've run the test five times
with five different samples
and the result remains the same.
- Shit!
- Tomica.
EAZY E: Tomica.
But she's pregnant, Doc. What's this mean?
It doesn't necessarily mean
that she's contracted the virus,
but we have to test her to be sure.
What do we do? When we start the treatment?
I mean, what... I gotta get healthy.
I got things to do. I got...
What am I supposed to do?
Mr. Wright, you need to understand
that you are very, very sick.
But I don't even feel that bad, Doc.
Don't tell me that.
DOCTOR: With care and palliative care,
we can probably keep you comfortable
for maybe six months, at the very most.
EAZY E: Comfortable?
What do you mean, comfortable?
It's just a matter of time.
I am truly, truly sorry, Mr. Wright.
I'll leave you time to process this.
Doc. Come on, Doc. No.
Doc.
Come on!
as the leader of the group N.W.A
has revealed he has AIDS...
WOMAN:
for the kind of outpouring
of fan calls that we had.
I can't.
-
- Shh.
Just let me make this right.
Please.
'Cause you healthy, hmm?
- And the baby healthy.
- Yeah. We're healthy.
