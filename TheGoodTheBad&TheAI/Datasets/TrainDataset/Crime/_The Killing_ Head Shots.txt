Man:
You recognize the voice?
Where did you get this?
Goldie's apartment.
Sound like him to you?
I don't know.
Did Kallie ever tell you
about making tapes like these?
I knew some kids who would do
things like this, but...
not Kallie.
She wouldn't do nothing
like this
Do you know
where this place is?
That hotel.
Queens whatever dump
run by that crazy old bitch.
- Mama Dips?
- Yeah.
I'll bring this
downstairs to Tech,
maybe run it
through voice recognition,
see if it's a match to Goldie.
What's up?
That's my ring.
Gave it to her.
When?
Three days ago.
Last time I saw her.
We're gonna need
a search warrant.
I got the hook-up
with the judge.
I'll call Skinner.
You think she's at Mama Dips'?
- You go home, Bullet.
- Wait.
I'll be back, okay?
Just wait here.
Remember me, Mama San?
Mama Dips: Now what?
We got that search warrant
you were asking about.
I don't give a damn
what you got.
You could either give us
the master key,
or we're gonna kick in
every door in this flophouse.
Get off of my property.
That's how you want
to play it, baby?
All right.
Go.
Man: All right, move, move.
Woman: I didn't do anything,
all right?!
Officer: We checked the west end
of the building.
We're moving on
to the east side.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Open that door.
Screw you.
No!
Sit down!
This is my property!
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
What is that?
It's coming from
behind that wall.
Holder. False panel.

Head Shots
You're gonna be seeing
a whole lot more of us now,
my friend.
We're gonna be best buddies
by the time we kill ya.
You're gonna have to work
a whole lot harder next time,
you want to get out of here.
Alton: Man wasn't trying to kill
himself, you damn redneck.
Just showing he don't care
about nothin' or no one.
He cut out that tattoo
so y'all ain't got nothin'
to hold over him.
No point of weakness.
Henderson: Shut up, Hill.
Go back to bed.
Ah, hell, no.
Open 204!
Free country.
I do what I like.
Ain't that right, Big Noise?
Close 204!
It's my legal obligation to
make sure the state kills you.
That man like
a champion gladiator.
You're just like Spartacus,
ain't you?
You Spartacus?
Yeah, you Spartacus.
You be pretending
like you don't like me,
but I got you.
That's right.
It's her hotel where they film
the porn tapes.
Goldie the pimp--
was that his voice on the tapes?
The voice match
was inconclusive.
It's a crap recording,
so it's tough to match.
I don't think it's him.
Mm.
We do know that our missing
girl, Kallie Leeds,
was at the hotel the night
she disappeared,
making one of those tapes.
Did we positively ID the Leeds
girl as one of our bodies?
No.
Her mom says she isn't missing.
Do we have any of our confirmed
dead girls on the porn tapes?
All right, you and Holder,
get in there and have a talk
with Madam Dibs
or whatever the hell
her name is.
Holder can do it,
and Reddick's en route,
so maybe I just...
sit this one out?
Is there a problem?
No.
'Course not.
Look, I don't care who does it.
Just get it done
before she lawyers up.
Nothing I hate more
than being woken up in the
middle of the night for BS.
We already talked to grandma.
Watch wonder boy charm
the bloomers off her.
He's getting pretty good at it.
Well, he's learning from a pro.
Finally.
Yep. You said it.
You said you saw Kallie Leeds
in the hotel parking lot
that night.
You forgot to mention
the Oscar-winning performance
in the back room, though.
Mama Dips: Those kids pay me
I don't ask what they're doing.
Yeah,  hold up.
Hidden panel, secret room,
and you don't know nothin'?
Yeah.
Who's Kallie Leeds' costar?
Perv asking the questions?
It was me.
You?
I'm a heavy smoker.
So it's a one-woman
operation, huh?
You find the girls,
you ask them questions,
you film it--
you get off on it?
That's right.
Why is that so hard to believe?
I'm a modern woman.
I do it all.
Let her sit for a couple
of days.
Maybe she'll have
a change of heart.
Sarah: But what if Kallie's
still alive,
being held out there somewhere?
Then Goldie will lead us
to her.
And in the meantime,
we wait for that to happen?
What if Goldie's
not the killer?
We just wait for the next girl
to show up dead?
In the meantime,
get a warrant
for Goldie's juvie records,
your buddy, Judge Elliot,
gets to court at 7:00.
You and me,
we'll have a talk with him.
I think I'll go back
to her mom and have a talk.
What's gonna change
from yesterday?
She's been a murder cop,
what, six years?
So what?
She's good at it.
I've forgotten more convictions
than she'll ever have.
Yeah, well, you're a lot--
older.
Get off me.
You find Kallie?
Go on.
Go on.
Live a little.
That's nasty.
Ain't you got any normal food
around here?
Like chips or something?
Might as well be mainlining
I don't do none of that.
My body's a temple.
Suit yourself, Bullet.
Man, you look like a rabbit.
Like some big, hairless,
albino Bugs Bunny.
All right, I'm cool with that.
See, I like rabbits.
Bugs Bunny's the bomb.
You know rabbits
got three eyelids
and their teeth
never stop growing?
Yeah.
But they can't puke.
Don't got enough
stomach muscles.
Damn.
How you know that?
You watch
the Discovery Channel?
No.
I learned it in zoology class
in my boarding school.
All right.
Anyway...
I gotta jet.
You stay safe
out there, you hear?
Look, I gotta go to work.
I got three blow-dries
back to back.
I told you Kallie's fine.
Sarah: We're gonna need
your daughter's dental records.
Yeah, well,
good luck with that.
She's never been to no dentist.
Her teeth are perfect.
Your daughter's a prostitute.
Are you aware of that?
It's just a phase.
She'll grow out of it.
I just started this new job,
and the owner's
a real prick, so--
Sit down.
Excuse me?
I don't have to hear this
in my own home.
Yeah, you do, actually.
Sit down.
I'm not done with you.
Man:
This is where your daughter was
three days ago.
Do you recognize his voice?
Does your daughter have a pimp?
Did she ever mention
somebody named Goldie?
Her friend Bullet said Kallie
was on her way here
the night she disappeared
when she couldn't get a bed
at the shelter.
Thought maybe she would
crash at home.
What?
I told her I had somebody
coming over.
My boyfriend.
So she did come here
that night?
I locked the door,
and she knocked...
and I didn't answer.
So she went away.
Look, the last time that she was
here, she stole $100,
and I didn't see her
for days, all right?
So if we're done here,
I-I got to go to work.
See you at the hotel,
all right?
Joaquin Phoenix
didn't go to school.
I mean, he lived
on the streets panhandling.
You know, and he lived free.
What are we doing here?
I thought we were going
to the office.
I need to talk.
I got bad news.
Your piss test came back dirty.
That's impossible!
What can I say?
The dye don't lie.
I've been totally clean,
I swear!
Look, I--
I can't go back to juvie.
I'm supposed to go to LA
next month.
I got my headshots
and my hair and everything.
I got plans!
Come on, man.
You know I've been
keeping clean, right?
You kids.
You're all the same.
No sense of responsibility.
No sense of decency,
or how your actions
affect those around you.
Not that.
Get in the back.
Take your pants down.
No--
I don't do that.
I'm-- I'm not gay.
Neither am I.
Henderson:
Your antibiotic.
Doc says you got to take it
twice a day
or you're gonna get
some kind of infection.
Come on, will you just take it?
Alton: That's second-level shit
right there.
Not a smart move, Seward.
You're not careful,
you  gonna get an infection.
And you're gonna have pus
coming out of your willie
or some damn thing.
Shut it, Hill!
"Pus coming out
of your willie."
What's he think you got,
the clap?
You right about them
antibiotics, though.
I never take them myself.
They give you the runs.
I remember I had green pus
coming out of my ear once.
They ass didn't want to give me
no Q-tips,
so I started digging.
You know how I know
you're not innocent?
It's because
you never shut up about it.
It's quoting your transcript,
talking about your lawyers
going over your evidence,
just on and on and on
about how you're gaming
the system.
Well, an innocent man
doesn't need to game nothing
because he knows the truth,
and the truth is
that we've all got
a death sentence...
whether you're innocent
or guilty.
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, Spartacus.
See, it's the innocent man
that gotta speak up
because it's the only hope
we got.
"Hope."
Hope's the same as faith.
That bitch will kill you faster
than this place will.
Off of dental records,
we've gotten seven
positive IDs so far.
The killer is not particular
about the race of his victim.
The only consistencies
are gender and age range.
Okay, you two got a connect
between the porn tapes
and our dead girls?
We're still trying to ID
the male voice on the tapes.
And although we haven't
positively ID'd her body,
our missing girl, Kallie Leeds,
fits the profile
of our known victims.
So the mother confirmed
the daughter is missing.
No. In fact, her mom saw her
that night around 1:00 AM.
They locked her
out of the house.
So, the girl is  missing.
She is, we believe.
She made one of those porn tapes
the night she disappeared.
At the Queens Motel.
We got a bunch of pervs
and the owner, Margery Dips.
We believe she's protecting
the film-maker.
Caroline: Unless you have
specific charges
beyond solicitation,
Lieutenant, my office suggests
you cut your johns
and junkies loose.
The DA's focusing on Dips.
She's the big fish.
Connect it to the kiddie porn.
Agreed. Okay.
That pimp that we stimulated
and let roam.
Sheldon "Goldie" Willis.
Has an impressive
arrest history
for pandering
and statutory rape.
Just opened up
his juvie records,
and I'm liking him
more and more.
Age 15 while attempting to rape
an 11-year-old,
Goldie held a knife
to her throat
and threatened to cut her
ear to ear if she moved.
Still got eyes
on his residence?
Been holed up for the last 24.
He's got to make a move
eventually.
Sarah: So far,
we don't have any
tangible connection
between Goldie
and our dead girls.
Besides the fact that they're
hookers and he's a pimp?
Okay, that's it.
I want shift reports
around the clock,
every 24 hours.
These are the screen grabs
of all the girls
from the porn tapes.
Sorry it took so long.
Any matches to our dead girls?
No. Sorry.
Thanks.
Hey, Holder, come here.
What do you think?
Holder: Maybe.
Wait.
Yeah.
Same guy, same place,
Queens Hotel.
Maybe Vice can help us ID him?
It's gonna be tough.
Both this girl and Kallie were
with him-- both are dead.
Until we got a body,
Kallie Leeds ain't a victim.
Just heard from Nance.
Goldie's on the move.
Let's go.
You know how many rivers
down the wall of my cell?
I know this because I count them
all every single day.
Day in, day out.
It never changes.
I mean, this is what I do.
You know?
You really  Spartacus.
How come you ain't got no ink?
Ain't got no tats or nothin'.
You want to see my tattoos?
This here's
my Mexican mafia tattoo.
Black guerillas.
Ah, and this...
my daddy gave me.
The day I was sentenced
to Cedar Creek.
Adult gen pop.
I was 16.
He took a baseball bat
to my head.
Beat the hell out of me.
Said his son
wasn't ever gonna be a pussy.
I'd go in a man,
and I'd stay a man
till the day I died.
Yeah?
And how is that
working for you?
Bullet: Thought
you were off the shiz.
Lyric know you're using
her money for
You oughta be sellin'
your own ass
if you're gonna use  scratch
to get loaded.
Ain't your PO making you test?
I ain't going back there.
Ever. Ever.
What's wrong?
Just leave me alone.
Yo, Twitch.
Twitch! Twitch,
where you going?!
Sarah: Do you recognize this voice
from any of your Vice jobs?
Bell:
This looks home-grown.
Most of the hard candy we find
is a little more professional.
We're looking for a connection
between the guy
asking the question
and the killer's vics.
We've got at least one,
maybe two matches.
I don't-- I don't recognize
any of these...
films...
and I've seen a lot
of this amateur crap.
But this girl.
I know her.
Yeah?
Tiffany something or other.
Picked her up last week
for solicitation.
She's alive?
And kicking.
So, what was his name--
the guy who made the video?
I don't know.
That was a long time ago.
So, tell me
what you  remember.
He was white.
Kind of short.
Nice enough,
said I reminded him of Rihanna.
Where'd you meet him?
On the street.
Like how I "meet"
everyone else.
And what kind of car
did he drive?
I don't know.
What happened after you made
the video with him?
He let me stay
in that motel room.
It was raining.
He bought us some Carl's Jr.
Let me have his fries.
Child: Mama!
It was nice.
Mama.
Mama.
Hey, baby.
Mama's coming.
He was one of the good ones.
Reddick:
Wait for him to come out.
Number 314,
you got eyes on the suspect?
Yeah, we got eyes
on Goldie. Over.
You don't have to be so hard
on Linden, man.
She's not that bad.
Here's the thing.
Linden's never worked
sex crimes,
has no idea
how these people think.
I teach the freakin' class
on this.
You've given this an awful lot
of thought, Carl.
Yeah, well...
Got 23 years in this bureau.
She's been handling dead bodies
for like a minute.
Want to put your career
in her hands?
What the hell
you talking about?
I'm not putting my career
in  hands.
There he is.
Who's that with him?
It's a woman.
Suspect is leaving
Yasler Terrace,
heading east on Sherman.
He is not alone.
He's got an unidentified
woman in the car.
He's headed to the dump site.
We need all available units
in the West Seattle area.
Suspect is heading towards
the retention pond
off Grover Road.
He has an unidentified female
in the vehicle.
Man: Copy that.
What the hell is he doing?
Goldie: Yo! I got an official
announcement.
My name is Goldie Willis.
This is my mom,
and I'm the serial killer.
Reddick: Sorry, we don't have anything
for you right now.
Holder:
Female reporter:
There you are.
What happened to you
last night, baby?
Yeah, I waited up for you.
You never even called.
Sure.
I can go tonight.
You should have seen
Hill and Seward
out there in the yard today
yukking it up.
Regular A-hole
buddies now.
Gonna have to think
what I'm gonna do about that,
'cause I don't like it.
How'd it go
with the medication?
Yeah.
Fine. No problem.
Good.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Double shift.
Just... psyching myself up
to go home.
Donna keeps asking me questions
about this place, and...
I just don't want
to talk about it.
Well, how about this?
You come to my place,
you get a beer.
I live three miles away.
Talk to Donna and the kid
tomorrow.
No point in going home anyway.
Let's go.
I just need one more bag.
No, you don't.
Smurf says Nico's selling
at Freeway Park.
Freeway park?
You're  going
to Freeway Park.
Hey, yo, watch it, dick!
Hey!
That's Tank's park.
He don't own the park.
He'll straight murder you,
fool!
Twit-- Twitch.
Damn it.
Lyric is probably waiting
for you back at the hotel.
Let's just go back there, okay?
Hey, yo, spare some change?
No. Get lost!
Douchebag!
Hey, hey.
Hey, you piss off, man!
Just let it go.
Twitch.
I hope you like it spicy.
Frank loves his chili fierce.
Thank you.
Man: Can't keep it in. Finally
a line change is in order.
Frank Jr., come on in here.
Have dinner with your dad.
I'm doing homework.
Frankie, get in here.
Finish the game.
Got an algebra test
tomorrow, dad.
Kid's smart.
He gets A's in everything,
not like the old man.
Going out for football
next year.
Oh, yeah?
I played
high-school football.
I was a defensive tackle.
Well, you got the shoulders
for it.
Annie.
Get me a couple beers.
Those are the last ones.
You know what? I got a half one.
I'm good.
What, are you kidding me?
We're just getting started.
I got a couple cases
in the garage.
I-- Really, I'm--
He never has anyone over.
Especially a Green Tag.
Yeah, well, I don't--
I don't mean to intrude.
No. No, it's good for Frank Jr.
to see his dad laugh...
occasionally.
I mean, well,
you know how it is.
You guys are gone all the time,
and then, you know,
when you're home,
it ain't much fun.
Yeah.
I know how that is.
And these double shifts--
I mean, they're hell
on a marriage.
Most nights he's gone, I sleep
right here on the couch.
I hate sleeping in that bed...
alone.
Hey.
Don't fool me for a minute.
Seward didn't take
his medication, did he?
No.
I tried, but he--
he just wouldn't do it.
Bullet: Twitch. Twitch!
Come on! Twitch!
Hey, bitches,
stay out of our park!
Twitch:
Ain't your park, A-hole.
Punk-ass queers!
Yo, who you calling
a queer, bitch?
Yo, you and
your dog-faced midget!
Yo, bite me!
Screw you.
Twitch, turn and bail.
Come on, man, this is crazy.
Tank's gonna kill you.
Pussy.
You know what?
Fine, get yourself killed!
This here is  park!
Twitch.
Twitch!
You mind telling me what
the hell happened out there?
Holder:
Following the suspect.
You let this clown
hijack your investigation.
The public's panicking.
I've got the Mayor on my ass
about finding
some pied piper...
who now has a nickname,
thanks to your pimp.
Loo, it was your idea
to cut him loose.
I thought it was a good idea.
At least now the scumbag's
behind bars.
Yeah.
You, you have any good news
for me?
No.
Swell.
Chief.
This is just... great.
Great.
I just talked to this girl,
Tiffany,
who was one of the porn actors.
Reddick:
She's alive, huh?
There goes your "find the porn
maker, find the killer" theory.
She says she can't remember
the film-maker,
but I don't buy it.
I'm pretty sure they had some
sort of relationship,
and I want to know who he is.
But he didn't kill her.
What's your theory about that?
I got a feeling my girl
knows more than she's saying.
I want to have another go
at her,
and I could use your help.
For God's sake. You know what?
You should go over that list
of johns
arrested for beating up
prostitutes.
See if any of them
has any connections
to medical facilities.
That'd be a better use
of your time, wouldn't it?
Carl, why are you still here?
What?
What are you doing here?
I mean, really.
Haven't you ever wondered
why you never made sergeant?
I'll tell you why.
Because 23 years of experience,
and all you are is in the way.
I'm talking to Skinner
about her.
She's going 5150 on us.
Yo, Linden.
I'm coming with you.
But I'm driving.
Twitch?
Oh, my God.
What happened?
Dickhead went lookin' to score
in Freeway Park.
Got his ass kicked.
Look at me.
I can't go to LA like this.
Such a joke.
Lyric:
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm-- I'm gonna
go to the drugstore
and get some stuff...
to put on that... cut.
And...
then I'll get some ice
from the liquor store
and some band-aids...
and some popsicles.
Popsicles?
For your lip.
They'll make you
feel better, baby.
I don't like orange.
Okay.
Then strawberry.
They always got strawberry.
It's gonna be okay, baby.
I told you,
I don't remember his name.
Look at this girl.
Janice Gibbs.
Had her head nearly cut off.
And-- and Marla Ritter.
Just had a baby when he drug her
out to the field and raped her.
What you want me to do
about it?
Each one of these girls
sat in that hotel room,
answered those same questions,
and then was given a happy meal,
just like you were.
That's what men like this do.
They make you think
that you're special,
that you're the only one,
but it's not true.
Get out of my house.
It's too bad you grew up,
got old and pregnant.
What would he think
if he saw you now?
What that grown man
did to you...
it's not right.
Taking that from a kid.
He didn't  anything
from me!
He fed you.
Said you were pretty.
I was.
Still are.
I mean, look at you.
You got it going on, girl.
Any man who would want
to dump you
because you grew up
into a fine young woman...
is crazy.
Why would you want to protect
a man like that?
Alton: The man says
if you want to be happy,
free your heart from hatred
and free your mind from worry.
Like that's gonna work.
I mean, it does for me.
Every time I get
a janky-ass thought,
I just think
about something else.
Like what?
Like, I name all 50 states
and try to find one
that make me feel good.
Detroit.
My dad took me to a club
there once,
and I heard James Brown.
Man was like 70 years old
but could do a back flip,
drop into the splits,
and come up singing.
Detroit's not a state.
That's not the point.
Time to take your medication,
convict.
Attaboy.
Open 209.
Alton:
What's up, man?
Becker:
Take the pill.
Alton:
Be trippin', man.
Hey, man, don't take that pill.
Okay.
Becker:
Take your damn pill.
Screw them, man.
Don't even take that pill.
It's up to you, convict.
I got nowhere to go.
Aah!
Becker: Like I said,
I got nowhere to go.
I knew you'd see it my way.
Put him back in 209.
Alton:
I could have taken more.
You didn't have to give in.
You let them win.
Seward:
They won a long time ago.
Holder: Joe Mills.
Joseph.
So, what'd you say
to Carl, anyway?
Nothing.
He's gonna hate you.
Not as much as he hates you.
I can't guarantee
you're gonna make sergeant
by working with me.
What makes you think
I need your help?
I hate to say it, Linden,
but so far,
none of this porn stuff
seems to lead back
to Trisha Seward.
I know.
If Seward didn't kill his wife,
we're running out of time
to prove it.
How we doing on Mills?
Searching.
What's up with that ADA anyway?
You two a thing?
You jealous?
Son of a bitch!
Mills?
We took him in last night
at Hotel Mama's.
Cut him loose six hours ago.
