When I start out
to make a fool of myself...
...there´s very little can stop me.
If I´d known where it would end,
I´d have never let anything start.
If I´d been in my right mind, that is.
But once I´d seen her...
...I was not in my right
mind for quite some time.
"Good evening," said I,
thinking myself a very gay dog indeed.
But here was a beautiful girl...
...and me with plenty of
time to get myself into trouble.
Some people can smell danger.
Not me.
I asked her
if she´d have a cigarette.
It´s me last one,
so please don´t disappoint me.
But I don´t smoke.
That´s how I found her.
And from that moment on,
I did not use my head very much...
...except to be thinking of her.
But in the park in those days...
...the rough young fellas
used to be staging holdups.
Help! Help!
These young fellas
were not professionals.
That´s the reason...
...why I start out in
this story a little bit like a hero.
Which I most certainly am not.
The cabdriver
woke up, he was okay...
...so I borrowed his
carriage to drive the lady home.
In a while she recovered
herself and brightened up...
...what with the things I told
her to get her mind off the scare...
...and to set her thinking as well of
the brave fella that had rescued her.
Rosalie.
Fair Rosalie. It´s a name
I´m after calling you. Why not?
It´s a gorgeous, romantic
little name entirely.
-I´m Michael, a poor sailor...
-You´re a character.
...with the princess of
Central Park riding along at his side.
I want to know where
does the princess come from?
I don´t know why
she should tell you but...
Well, her parents
were Russian, quite Russian.
You never heard of the place she´s from.
-Would Your Highness care to gamble?
-She´s done it for a living.
I bet you I´ve been
to the place you were born.
-Cheefoo.
-It's on the China coast.
It´s the second wickedest city.
-What´s the first?
-Macao.
-I worked there.
-You worked in Macao?
Here´s your dollar. How
about Shanghai? I worked there too.
-As a gambler?
-Well...
Hope you were luckier than tonight.
You need more than luck in Shanghai.
-Do you know what?
-What?
I bet I could drive the cart
from down there inside with you.
There´s a police
car on the other road.
We best get out of the park. It´s
too simple for the cops to find us.
You don´t like them.
The cops struggle along
without our doing their work for them.
Watch where you´re going!
Get that nag out of here!
Now the cops are bound to pick us up.
We´d best leave the cab here and walk.
-You don´t like the police.
-I do not.
My car´s right there
in the garage, anyway.
Tell me, Michael, is there some
reason why the police don´t like you?
Well, they never
put me in jail in America.
You know, the nicest jails are in
Australia, the worst are in Spain.
What law did you break in Spain?
I killed a man.
Just now you almost killed a girl.
Is there a law against that?
Try it, you won´t like the jails.
They put you in jail for murder?
I didn´t think so.
A man killed his
wife in Frisco last week.
She´d gone to the icebox for supper.
He thought she was a burglar, he said.
He shot her five times in the head.
-He had a good lawyer.
-Evidently. I saw his picture.
-Bainbridge.
-Bannister.
Arthur Bannister. It said he´s
the world´s greatest criminal lawyer.
-Some people think he is.
-Here´s your car.
Send the bill to my husband.
If you´re a sailor, there´s a job for
you. Would you like to work for me?
I´d like it.
I´m shipping out tomorrow.
So are we! To the West
Coast, by way of the Canal.
We´re short a man on the crew.
I´ll make it worth your while.
Could it be this you´re looking for?
You were smart to carry
a gun, traveling alone in the park...
...but if you knew you had the gun
in your bag, why throw away the bag?
I meant for you to find it.
I don´t know how to shoot.
It´s easy.
You just pull the trigger.
Some dame, ain´t she?
Yeah. And some car.
Evening, Mr. Grisby.
Mr. Bannister sent it
all the way from San Francisco.
So she could have it here.
-Bannister?
-Arthur Bannister, himself.
Gee, some guys have all the luck.
Personally, I don´t like
a girlfriend to have a husband.
If she´ll fool a husband,
I figure she´ll fool me.
New York is not as big
as it pretends to be...
...so I spent the next
day in the hiring hall...
...waiting for a ship.
That way, big boob that I am...
...I thought I could escape her.
S.S. American Trader...
Cigarettes will stunt
your growth. Come here!
Excuse me.
I wonder if you could
help me locate a Mr. O´Hara.
Michael O´Hara.
Mike O´Hara?
You mean Black Irish that talks fancy?
-I don´t know him myself but...
-Black Irish?
Yeah, I know him. Joe, call Mike
O´Hara, a guy here wants to see him.
Michael O´Hara, please
step to the bulletin board.
A man wants to see you.
-Shipmates?
-We was in Spain together.
They started calling him Black Irish
after what he did to finks back in ´39.
Mike´s got blarney, but he
can hurt a man when he gets mad.
You were asking for me?
-O´Hara?
-O´Hara.
You´re what they call
an able-bodied seaman?
That´s what they call it.
-You ever work on a yacht?
-No.
-I presume you can handle a speedboat.
-I presume so.
Do you drink?
I beg your pardon?
I asked you if you drink.
Whatever´s set in front of me. Doesn´t
have to be wholesome, just strong.
Do you drink habitually?
May I ask, mister,
if you´re extending an invitation?
I guess it might as well be.
If you´ll show me to the nearest bar...
...we´ll sit down and
discuss your coming to work for me.
My name is Bannister.
Bannister.
Me boys, may I present
Mr. Arthur Bannister.
The world´s greatest criminal lawyer.
-This is Jake Bjoronson and...
-Hi.
...Goldie, right?
Hi, I´m Goldfish...
Mr. Bannister´s wife sent him to get
me, isn´t that right, Mr. Bannister?
Now, Mr. Bannister is
gonna buy us all a few drinks...
...while I entertain myself
by refusing to go to work for him.
You know, Mike saved my wife´s life.
Here, would you mind
inserting these coins? Number four.
That´s all we like to hear.
Mike´s quite a hero.
Quite a tough guy.
Mister, there ain´t no such thing.
No such thing as...
...tough guy?
What´s a tough guy?
I don´t know.
A guy with an edge.
What makes him sing better
than me? Something in here.
What makes it loud?
A microphone. That´s his edge.
-Edge?
-A gun, a nightstick or a razor.
Something the other guy ain´t got.
An extra reach on a punch, instead of
brass knuckles, a stripe on a sleeve...
...a badge that says "cop"
on it, a rock in your hand...
...or a bankroll in your pocket.
That´s an edge, brother.
Without an edge,
there ain´t no tough guy.
-You hear that, Black Irish?
-It's true.
Well...
...bear it in mind.
Yeah, but what makes
him sing prettier than you?
Naturally, someone
had to take Mr. Bannister home.
I told myself
I couldn´t leave a helpless man...
...lying unconscious in a saloon.
Well, it was me
that was unconscious...
...and he was exactly
as helpless as a sleeping rattlesnake.
Say, it´s nice of you, Michael, to
be so nice to me while I was so drunk.
Lover!
I wasn´t sure you´d come.
I´m not staying.
You´ve got to stay.
Lover!
It´s gonna be a real nice cruise.
First, the Panama Canal,
then up the Mexican coast.
We need a boatswain,
Danny-boy. Ever done any sailing?
A bit of it. I saw you
last night at the garage.
Somebody else, Danny-boy.
Not me.
Don´t go.
She needs you bad.
You stay.
If you play your cards right,
we can get a job for the both of us.
I think we´ll take it.
And what was I, Mike
O´Hara, doing on a luxury yacht...
...pleasure-cruising
in the sunny Caribbean Sea?
Well, it´s clear now,
I was chasing a married woman.
But that´s not the way
I wanted to look at it. No.
To be a real prize
fathead like Mike O´Hara...
...you´ve got to swallow all the lies
you can think up to tell yourself.
Our little expedition spent
some weeks in the West Indies.
Dawdling around, seeing
the sights, laying in supplies...
...and getting into more trouble.
Hi!
Hi, onboard the Cerce!
You there!
Why don´t you go swimming?
I beg your pardon?
I say, why don´t you go swimming?
I didn´t bring a swimming
suit along on the job, sir.
You ought to the next time.
There won´t be
a next time. I´m quitting.
My trunks ought to fit you.
You´ll find them in the locker.
I suppose you´re wondering who I am.
I saw you in New York.
I flew in this morning,
by way of Havana.
I´m George Grisby, you know.
Grisby & Bannister.
-Where is everybody, gone ashore?
-Almost everybody.
My partner too? Mr. Bannister?
That´s right.
And the lady?
Oh...
Mr. Bannister tells me
you once killed a man.
-You are Michael, aren´t you?
-That´s right.
I´m very interested in murders.
Forgive me if I seem inquisitive...
-...but where´d it happen?
-At Murcia.
How´d you do it?
No, let me guess.
You did it with your hands, didn´t you?
Does it ever bother you
when you think about it?
What did he do to you?
Nothing.
You just killed him
for the fun of it, eh?
He was a Franco spy.
There was a war at the time.
Then it wasn´t murder, I suppose.
Tell me, would you do it again?
Would you mind killing another man?
I´d kill another Franco spy.
I was on a pro-Franco committee,
fella, during the Spanish War.
Would you kill me
if I gave you the chance?
I may give you the chance.
Michael!
Michael!
Before Li went ashore,
did he make lunch?
-Yes, ma´am.
-ls there enough for two?
I don´t know. Why don´t
you ask Mrs. Bannister?
You ask her.
Would you like
a good paste in the eye?
I wish she´d asked me to go swimming.
She´ll ask you.
You wait and see.
Will you help me?
Give me a cigarette.
I´m learning to smoke now.
Ever since that night in the park...
...I´ve been getting the habit.
Do all rich women
play games like this?
Call me Rosalie.
-I didn´t think you would do that.
-I didn´t either.
You´re scared, aren´t you?
You´re scared.
I´m scared too.
Methinks you needed me to help you.
Sure, if you need
anything, you help yourself.
I´m not what you think I am.
I just try to be like that.
Keep on trying...
...you might make it.
Oh, Michael.
What are we scared of?
So long, kiddies!
Now he knows about us.
I wish I did.
Bye-bye!
Michael.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Grisby has
just told me something...
...I´m very sorry to hear.
Lover, this concerns you
more than anyone else.
Don´t take your arms...
...away
According to George here,
Michael is anxious to quit.
Comes a change in weather
-Did you know about that, lover?
-No, I didn´t.
Shut up, George. What´s
the matter, the hours too long?
-No, sir.
-How about the money?
I don´t care about that.
Money doesn´t interest you.
Are you independently wealthy?
I´m independent.
Of money?
Before you start that novel,
you better learn something.
You traveled around the world
too much to find out about it.
That´s good.
Well, sir...
...I´ve always found
it sanitary to be broke.
That´s good too, Arthur.
Shut up, George.
Money cannot bring you health
and happiness, et cetera, is that it?
Without money, I´d be flat
on my back in a county hospital.
Look at this yacht.
It once belonged to Jules Bachrach...
...who kept me out of his club because
my mother was a Manchester Greek.
I got him on perjury.
He died bankrupt, and here I am.
George.
-Each has his idea of happiness...
-Light this for me.
I´ve got no match.
...but money is what
all of us have in common.
Take Bessie, here.
She used to work for Bachrach.
-I pay her more, don´t I?
-Yes, Mr. Bannister.
Her salary means happiness.
It means a home.
Three rooms for two families.
She´s a grandmother and
a widow and only one boy works.
-lsn´t that right?
-Yes.
Yes, of course it is.
So Bessie goes
to church every Sunday...
...and prays to God she´ll never be
too old to earn the salary I pay her.
You call yourself independent.
-Come and see me five years from now.
-Aye-aye, sir.
Sing it for us again, lover.
Why do you stand for that?
I´m quitting. Why don´t you?
You heard him, I need the money!
Talk of money and murder.
I must be insane...
...or these people are lunatics.
That´s why I can´t leave.
That poor little child he married...
...somebody´s got to take care of her.
Please don´t hold me
But if you hold me
Don´t take your arms
Away
Comes a change in weather
Comes a change of heart
And who knows when
The rain will start
So I beg you
Please don´t love me
But if you love me
Then don´t take your lips
Or your arms
Or your love
Away
Rub
Rub Glosso Lusto in your hair
Keep it Glosso Lusto bright
G-L-O double-S-O
L-U-S-T-O
Is right
Glosso Lusto
So remember, ladies, use Glosso Lusto.
Pleases your hair.
Pleases the man you love.
Will you help me?
Love. Do you believe
in love at all, Mrs. Bannister?
Give me the wheel.
I was taught to think
about love in Chinese.
The way a Frenchman
thinks about laughter in French?
The Chinese say...
...it is difficult
for love to last long...
...therefore, one
who loves passionately...
...is cured of love in the end.
That´s a hard way of thinking.
There´s more to the proverb.
Human nature is eternal...
...therefore, one
who follows his nature...
...keeps his
original nature in the end.
Lover.
Yes.
Aren´t you glad I talked
Michael into coming along...
...lover?
He must´ve changed his mind about me.
Faith, Mr. Bannister.
I´ve already told your wife...
...I never make up my mind
about anything at all...
...until it´s over and done with.
I´d like to, but
I can´t deny that Mr. Bannister...
...didn´t try to give his
wife the things she wanted.
She´d said once
that she liked picnics.
We were on our way
up the Mexican coast...
...when he decided
to stop and give her one.
Well, Mr. Bannister´s picnic party...
...was most typical of him.
A lot of trouble
and money went into it...
...but it was no more a picnic...
...than Bannister was a man.
When you hear what I got for you...
Sid, we´ve worked many cases. I´ll
be sorry to make this one the last.
-This is...
-There´s a plot against my life.
I´m going to be murdered.
Isn´t that it?
I´m going to be killed.
Why, Sid, don´t you
think I know about it?
All about it!
Now leave me alone!
I want to enjoy myself.
Michael!
I found out about Broome. I tried
to tell you, he isn´t a steward.
-Not a good one.
-He´s a detective.
My husband hires him to watch me,
so I´ll never be able to divorce him.
-So he can divorce you.
-He wants to cut me off without a cent.
Does that matter so much?
Sweet, you don´t know
anything about the world.
Lately, I´ve been
rounding out my education.
I´ll say this much for you, Arthur.
When you give a picnic, it´s a picnic.
Time for another?
-Arthur.
-Time for another.
-You know what? Michael still insists...
-What?
I beg your pardon?
I said what.
Michael still insists on quitting.
-Why shouldn´t he?
-Oh, no.
-Arthur ought to make him stay.
-lf he wants to go, let him.
But George likes
to have him around, lover.
MichaeI´s so big and strong.
Makes a good bodyguard for you.
Isn´t that what you said, George?
I don´t need a bodyguard.
-Not even a big, strong one?
-Don´t make another drink.
-With an Irish brogue?
-He´s had enough.
George thinks MichaeI´s falling
for you, and that makes me unhappy.
George hopes...
...but George is wrong again.
Now, Arthur...
-I didn´t say anything about them.
-Make me another drink, George.
Another Grisby special, coming up.
You know, you´re
a stupid fool, George.
You ought to realize I don´t mind it a
bit if MichaeI´s in love with my wife.
He´s young.
She´s young.
He´s strong.
She´s beautiful.
Sit down, darling.
Where´s your sense of humor?
I don´t have to listen to you.
Oh, yes you do, lover.
Now, Arthur...
...you leave Elsa alone.
Come to think of it...
...why doesn´t Michael
want to work for us?
Why should he?
Why should anyone want
to live around us?
Where´s your sense of adventure?
Broome!
-Excuse me, sir, he´s eating.
-Tell Michael to step over here.
Aye, sir.
Hey, Mike, they want to see you
over there, Mr. Bannister and them.
Well, Michael!
Well, Mr. Bannister?
My wife´s lost her sense of humor, and
you´ve lost your sense of adventure.
Sit down and have a drink.
Give him a drink, George.
And don´t look so shocked.
Michael may not be in the Social
Register, but then neither are you...
...anymore.
Is this what you folks
do for amusement?
Sit around toasting marshmallows
and call each other names?
If you´re so anxious for me
to join the game, I´d be glad to.
I have a few names I´d like
to be calling you myself.
Oh, but, Michael, that isn´t fair.
You´re bound to lose the contest.
We´ll have to give you
a handicap, Michael.
You should know what
George knows about me...
...if you really want
to call me names.
And, Michael...
...if you think George´s
story is interesting...
...you ought to hear the one about
how Elsa got to be my wife.
Do you want me to tell him
what you´ve got on me, Arthur?
Do you know...
...once, off the hump of Brazil...
...I saw the ocean so darkened
with blood it was black...
...and the sun fainting away
over the lip of the sky.
We´d put in at Fortaleza...
...and a few of us had lines out
for a bit of idle fishing.
It was me had the first strike.
A shark it was.
Then there was another.
And another shark again.
Till all about, the sea
was made of sharks...
...and more sharks still.
And no water at all.
My shark had torn himself
from the hook...
...and the scent or maybe the stain it
was, and him bleeding his life away...
...drove the rest of them mad.
Then the beasts took
to eating each other.
In their frenzy...
...they ate at themselves.
You could feel the lust of murder
like a wind stinging your eyes.
And you could smell the death
reeking up out of the sea.
I never saw anything worse...
...until this little picnic tonight.
And you know...
...there wasn´t one of them sharks
in the whole crazy pack that survived.
I´ll be leaving you now.
George, that´s the first time...
...anyone ever thought enough
of you to call you a shark.
If you were a good lawyer,
you´d be flattered.
-Where´s Mrs. Bannister?
-I´m sure I don´t know, sir.
-She adores it here in Acapulco.
-So do I...
It´s nice and quaint, but when are
we gonna get back to Frisco?
Mind walking with me, fella?
I know all the best places.
You might enjoy it.
I want to make you a proposition.
-Beautiful, isn´t it?
-The beach, you mean, or the tourists?
Everything.
´Tis a fair face to the land...
...but you can´t hide
the hunger and guilt.
It´s a bright, guilty world.
Darling, of course you pay me!
What´s your guess, Michael?
Think the world´s coming to an end?
There was a start to the world,
so I guess there´ll be a stop.
It´s coming, you know.
Oh, yeah.
It´s got to come.
First the big cities...
...then maybe even this.
It´s just got to come.
I prefer to be somewhere else
when it does.
I will be.
That´s what I need you for,
to see to it that I´m not around.
-How´d you like $5000?
-What?
That´s what I said.
$5000, fella.
What do I have to do for it?
I´ll fill in the details later.
Meanwhile, think it over, Michael.
Five thousand dollars.
It´s yours.
All you have to do is kill somebody.
Who, Mr. Grisby?
I´m particular who I murder.
Good boy!
You know...
...I wouldn´t like
to kill just anybody.
-ls it someone I know?
-Oh, yeah.
But you´ll never guess.
-I give up.
-It's me.
I´m perfectly sober, Michael.
I´m willing to pay $5000
if the job is well done.
This is a straightforward
business proposition.
I want you to kill me.
So long, fella!
Elsa!
-Michael?
-Yes.
-You talked to George yesterday?
-I did.
-Did he say anything about us?
-He´s afraid the world will explode.
He talked about suicide.
I´ve thought of that sometimes.
Suicide?
Do you think it´s wrong, Michael?
I don´t know.
Would you kill yourself if you had to?
I don´t know.
-I´ve looked at the pills many times...
-Pills?
The ones my husband takes
to kill the pain.
And wondered if enough of them
would kill my pain.
The pain of just being alive?
Mr. Grisby wants to be cured of that
pain. He wants me to cure him.
Mr. Grisby wants me
to kill Mr. Grisby.
-I´m sure he´s out of his mind.
-He´s not sane.
-Neither is Arthur.
-Arthur can take care of himself.
-What do you want?
-Beautiful moon.
Nice night for it,
ain´t it, Mr. O´Hara?
You didn´t answer me, Mr. O´Hara.
Speak when you´re spoken to.
I´d hate to have to report you
to the lady´s husband.
I said it´s a nice night for it.
Would you care to dance with me?
Stop crying. I can´t stand
for you to cry.
-You know what Broome´s been doing?
-Spying.
Spying on you.
Sure I´m gonna take you
where there aren´t any spies.
-Where?
-A long way off.
-Somewhere to the far places.
-Far places?
We´re in one of them now. Running
away doesn´t work. I tried it.
Everything´s bad, Michael.
Everything.
You can´t escape it or fight it.
Get along with it.
Deal with it. Make terms.
You´re such a foolish
knight errant, Michael.
You´re big and strong.
You just don´t know
how to take care of yourself.
So how could you take care of me?
Mike! Hey, Mike!
If you´ll pardon me this intrusion...
-...there´s a couple of cops out here.
-Cops?
I don´t speak their language.
And they wants me to identify this guy.
What´s the Spanish for "drunken bum"?
It was early October when
we made San Francisco...
...and dropped anchor across the bay
from the city, in Sausalito.
It had been a most
interesting cruise.
All very rich and rare and strange.
But I had had no stomach for it.
To begin with, living on a hook
takes away your appetite.
You´ve no taste for any pleasure
but the one that´s burning in you.
But even without an appetite...
...I´d learned it´s quite amazing
how much a fool like me can swallow.
Please, Michael, be careful.
The car´s down there.
Mr. Bannister´s waiting to
take you into the city...
...to San Francisco,
but you´re not going with him.
You´re going with me.
Michael...
I can take care of you.
You think I´d take you to a desert
island to eat berries and goat´s milk.
And I´d have to take in
washing to support you.
Hello, kiddies.
There´s George.
What would you say to $5000
to get us started?
We´ve got a date with
a couple of beers, fella.
Arthur was asking for you.
He´d wondered where you´d gone.
I won´t tell him.
-You didn´t answer my question. $5000?
-Goodbye, Michael.
Couldn´t we start on that?
Would you have to take in
washing on $5000?
Sit down.
I suppose you wonder what´s behind
my little proposition.
None of your business, actually,
but since we´re partners in crime...
...I´ll tell you, our firm´s insured
against the death of either partner.
That means if one of us dies,
the other will get a lot of money.
-Thanks. Now, leave us alone.
-Yes, sir.
Like some other people we both know,
I´m not very happily married.
And another thing, frankly...
...I don´t want to be within 1000
miles of that city or any city...
...when they start
dropping those bombs.
There´s been a suggestion
we drive you into town.
Want a beer before you go?
I´ll be waiting with
Mrs. Bannister in the car.
Better meet me in my office.
Make it late tonight.
What for?
$5000.
That´ll take a girl and a sailor
on a nice little trip.
-I´ll meet you at your office.
-Do.
There´s a paper I´d like you to sign.
It´s nothing very binding or important,
really.
Just a confession of murder.
Here´s to crime.
She say meet you at aquarium.
The aquarium?
Oh, uh...
...if you ever need
a good lawyer, Michael...
...let me know.
"l, Michael O´Hara, in order
to live in peace with my God...
...do freely make the following
confession. On August 9th..."
That´s tomorrow night.
"...I shot and killed
Mr. George Grisby...
...placing his corpse
in the Sausalito Bay."
Just a minute.
What you´re reading, am I
supposed to have written it?
It´s your confession.
It´s the easiest 5000
you´re ever gonna earn.
Why don´t you do it yourself?
Commit suicide? Me? Don´t be silly.
Suicide is against the law.
And we´re not gonna break the law.
This is going to be murder,
and it´s going to be legal.
I want to live, but I want to vanish.
I want to go away and change my name
and never be heard of again.
But that costs money.
It isn´t easy nowadays.
If they´re looking, they´ll find you.
Unless they think you´re dead.
They´ll find you even on the smallest
island in the South Seas.
That´s where I´m going to be, fella.
On that smallest island.
I´ll mail the rest to you
after the "murder".
But I want to live on
that island in peace.
That won´t be possible unless
the world is satisfied I don´t exist.
You know, the law´s
a funny thing, fella.
The state of California
will say I´m dead...
...officially dead...
...if somebody´ll say
they murdered me.
That´s what I´m paying you for.
-To murder you?
-Say you did.
-What happens to you, really?
-I disappear.
-What happens to me?
-Nothing.
That´s the choker.
You swear you killed me,
but you can´t be arrested.
That´s the law.
Look it up for yourself.
There´s no such thing as homicide...
...unless they find a corpse.
It just isn´t murder
if they don´t find a body.
According to the law...
...I´m dead if you say
you murdered me.
But you´re not a murderer
unless I´m dead.
Silly, isn´t it?
I´ve never seen an aquarium.
Would you show me about?
I couldn´t think where
else we could meet.
-Only tourists come here and children.
-And lovers?
-Oh, Michael.
-Fair Rosalie.
-Love me?
-I do.
Do you still want to
take me away with you?
Why do you ask me that?
Will you carry me off
into the sunrise?
I´ll take proper care of you.
You won´t starve.
I don´t care where it is, Michael.
Just take me there.
Take me quick.
Take me.
-Come on, come on.
-Can´t I look? I want to see.
I don´t want you to worry...
-I am.
-I have arrangements...
The things you said
yesterday about money.
You didn´t sound like you.
You´re not going to try
anything foolish, are you?
I´m afraid so.
Something very foolish indeed.
"l, Michael O´Hara, in order
to live in peace with my God...
...do freely make the following
confession."
Read the last part.
That explains the whole of it.
"We arrived at the boat landing.
Mr. Grisby heard a suspicious sound.
He was scared of a holdup and asked
me to get the gun out of the car.
I reached in and got the gun, but
it went off by accident in my hand.
And I saw that Mr. Grisby
was all covered with blood.
It took me a minute to realize
that Mr. Grisby was dead.
To realize that I,
Michael O´Hara, had killed him."
But I don´t understand. What were
you doing with George in Sausalito?
It says Mr. Grisby wants to go to the
yacht and asks me to drive him there.
And that´s where I kill him.
With the rough tide in the bay...
...they wouldn´t recover
the body if there was one.
You don´t understand, darling.
He isn´t dead yet. Grisby´s alive.
He won´t be murdered till tonight.
Is that foolish enough for you?
My husband wrote that
and got you to sign it for him.
It´s one of those famous
Bannister tricks.
It´s Grisby´s idea. It seems
Mr. Grisby wants to disappear.
And this is a scheme of his
to get himself declared dead.
There´s more to it than that, Michael.
I don´t know what, but there´s more.
It´s a trap of some kind.
You´ll meet George tonight,
just as he arranged.
Go with him to Sausalito and
do whatever he asks you to do.
As long as nobody gets hurt,
it won´t matter.
But don´t let him out of your sight.
Maybe George isn´t as big a fool
as he seems to be, but...
...I´ll swear my husband´s
behind this whole thing.
Oh, Michael, why did you let yourself
get dragged into it?
Sure because I´m a fool.
A deliberate, intentional fool.
And that´s the worst kind,
or didn´t you know?
Yes, my beloved. My beloved fool,
I know.
I don´t think anybody´s home,
just Broome.
Mr. Bannister´s in the city, and
Mrs. Bannister went to the movies.
Better wait for me in the kitchen.
Make some coffee. We´ll both need it.
I´ve got things to attend to.
Well?
I wonder, am I the only one
that´s onto you and her?
Nobody else seems to guess
you´re sweet on her.
That ought to be worth extra.
-I´ll throw it in for the same price.
-What are you selling?
I can shut up,
that´s what I´m selling.
You see, I´m a snoopy kind of a guy.
I find things out.
I get around.
I got around one afternoon
in Sausalito.
I overheard a conversation
in Mexico.
I found out about a little plot
of yours.
You wouldn´t want me to say nothing
about you framing Michael.
Frame him for a murder
you´re committing.
Let´s talk it over tomorrow, huh?
When you´ll be playing dead and
somebody else is really dead?
No, thanks, Mr. Grisby.
We´ll settle our account right now.
All right, Broome...
...if you insist.
-What are you doing?
-Oh, hello.
I´m sorry. You drive.
Were you shooting a gun?
Yeah, I was just doing
a little target practice.
That´s what you´ll say when you shoot
the gun, down by the boat landing.
People come out of the bar
to see what happened...
...you´ll say, "I was just doing
a little target practice."
Really, you´re supposed
to have shot me.
Later, when nobody´s looking,
you´re supposed...
...to have thrown my corpse
into the bay.
Look out!
Hey, what happened back there?
Anybody hurt?
-Kind of banged it up.
-It's our fault, I´m afraid.
-Here´s my card, for the damage.
-Looks like you´ve got damage.
-Your head´s cut bad.
-It's okay, really.
-It's all right, good night.
-Well, good night, Mr. Grisby.
-Did he get a good look at us?
-What?
Truck driver, I mean.
-He´ll make a good witness.
-What?
He´ll testify he saw us
just before the murder.
Broome, are you ill?
I got some lead in me where it hurts.
-I´ll call a doctor.
-Did already.
The trouble is, the doc
will report to the police.
They´ll want to know who was
the certain party who shot me.
Don´t worry, he´ll get his.
There´s gonna be a murder.
Ain´t no fake murder.
Somebody´s gonna be killed.
You mean...?
-Your husband´s gonna be knocked off.
-What?
Could be.
You´d better get down to his office,
if you want to do anything about it.
-What are you doing?
-Getting blood all over the car.
My blood.
It´s perfect. If you shot me,
there would be blood, fella, see.
Now, when you get back
to the garage...
...start washing out the blood stains.
You´re wiping out the evidence, see.
Be careful not to do such a good job
that they can´t analyze the stains.
Just try to wash that out.
Get the gun
from the glove compartment.
Good. Come on now, let´s go.
Let the ones in the bar
get a good look at you.
They´ll ask about the shooting.
Just say you´re doing
a little target practice.
Wait until the speedboat gets away.
-Understand?
-Where are you going?
Give me that cap.
-What are you laughing at?
-Wait and see.
Why don´t people let
some people get some sleep?
Somebody said they heard a shot.
Hey, what´s with the gun?
I was just doing a little
target practice.
-Where you going now?
-ls he drunk?
He´s soused!
San Rafael...
San Rafael, please.
Hello, I want to speak to
Mrs. Bannister.
What?
It´s me. Broome.
Get down to the office.
Montgomery Street.
You was framed.
Grisby didn´t want to disappear.
He just wanted an alibi.
And you´re it.
You´re the fall guy.
Grisby´s gone down there
to kill Bannister now.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Stop that car!
Stop the car!
Am I too late?
-Why don´t you save Bannister?
-Who?
-Who are you?
-Hey, that´s blood, ain´t it?
-Sure, it´s blood.
-It's all over the seat.
Will you let go of me?
-Give us your name!
-Michael O´Hara!
I want to know about Mr. Bannister!
"l, Michael O´Hara, in order
to live at peace with my God..."
Yes, Michael?
-You were asking for me?
-Pardon me.
"...do freely make the following
confession...
...on the evening of August 9th,
I shot and killed George Grisby."
You weren´t killed. It was Grisby.
Hello, darling.
Have you heard the news?
George has been murdered.
He was found here on the street
with MichaeI´s cap in his hand.
Michael is going to need
a good lawyer.
Well, it´s my own fault...
...but that´s how I got into it,
big boob that I am.
I began to ask myself if
I wasn´t out of my head entirely.
The wrong man was arrested.
The wrong man was shot.
Grisby was dead and so was Broome.
And what about Bannister?
He was going to defend me
in a trial for my life.
And me charged with a couple
of murders I did not commit.
Either me or the rest of the whole
world is absolutely insane.
You know my associate Mr. Sealy, dear.
He´s arranged for your jail pass.
It´s in this building.
Shall he take you?
-I´ll go by myself.
-Sealy, I´ll join you in the office.
Okay, Mr. Bannister.
Excuse me, Mrs. Bannister.
You want to be alone with Michael.
-It's your idea.
-Morning, Bannister.
Morning, judge.
Your boy still in the hospital?
-Been home since Tuesday.
-That´s fine, judge.
-Was it...
-What´s that, lover?
-Oh, I beg your pardon.
-Wasn´t it your idea?
Isn´t it your idea to save Michael
from the gas chamber?
-Aren´t we the only ones who can?
-What do you think? Galloway.
-Hi, Bannister. How´s tricks?
-You know our district attorney, dear.
-How do you do...
-Mrs. Bannister. Fasbender...
I was the murdered man´s partner.
The other was my servant.
If I defend Michael, any jury is going
to figure I believe he´s innocent.
And you have reason to believe
that Michael is innocent?
I hear that Galloway
is going to say...
...that Michael took George´s body
into the city in our speedboat.
-But we can prove...
-Prove? He couldn´t have.
-Why not?
-How´d he get back?
-Back where?
-To the yacht, naturally.
The boat couldn´t have driven itself.
Or maybe it was George´s ghost.
Maybe the boat just drifted back.
Now, lover...
...Michael has to plead
excusable homicide.
But you can prove it wasn´t his gun.
They know it wasn´t
MichaeI´s gun that killed George.
The gun that did kill George
can´t be found, lover.
So we can´t prove that Michael
didn´t shoot him.
And it was MichaeI´s gun
that killed Broome.
Now...
...Michael is going to need
everything that the greatest...
...living trial lawyer can do for him.
Our good district attorney there
has worked up a beautiful case.
The truck driver, the saloonkeeper.
They´ll be effective witnesses.
And he´ll know how to handle them.
And then there´s the crazy confession.
But Michael has an explanation.
-Explanation?
-You think it´s funny.
Funny?
That story about how George
hired Michael to kill George?
-To pretend to kill him.
-Really?
Why would George want to disappear?
-He mentioned partnership insurance.
-What?
-Partnership insurance.
-Which George wanted to collect?
And George wanted everybody
to think he was dead?
Dead, so that he could collect
the insurance?
Well, if he was dead,
how could he collect?
Now, lover...
...if your Irishman doesn´t want to
die, he´s going to have to trust me.
But you...
...do you trust him?
I wouldn´t trust him with my wife.
You want to make sure he doesn´t
get off, don´t you?
I´ve never lost a case, remember?
Besides...
...my wife might think
he was a martyr.
I´ve got to defend him.
I haven´t any choice.
And neither have you.
Hello.
It looks bad for me,
isn´t that what your husband says?
Whatever else he is,
Arthur´s a marvelous lawyer.
You´ve got to trust him.
-Why? Why should I trust him?
-Because it´s your only chance.
Because I want you to.
That´ll have to do for a reason.
Michael...
-Why did you kill Broome?
-What?
Don´t be afraid to tell me.
I want to know.
Grisby killed Broome. He was
going to murder your husband.
-George kill Arthur?
-You know that.
What could he gain from it?
For one thing, he couldn´t
get a divorce.
If people thought he was dead,
he could get away from his wife.
-Wife? But that´s impossible.
-Why?
George didn´t have a wife.
He wasn´t married.
Mrs. Bannister, I saved
a seat for youse.
Would youse gentlemen
please move over?
-Sit down.
-I just wanted to look at her.
I object!
The question calls for the operation
of the officer´s mind.
Sustained.
Very well. In the interest
of saving time, we´ll proceed.
I´m sure Officer Peters
is most anxious to go home...
...to his wife and family
before returning to duty.
Now, Officer Peters, except
for the blood, the clothes were dry.
-Yes, sir.
-They were dry...
...yet the defendant stated
he threw the body into the bay.
Your Honor, the district attorney isn´t
cross-examining, he´s making speeches.
That isn´t so.
I move for a mistrial on the grounds
that the jury is being prejudiced.
These are the great Bannister´s
trial tactics in appeal for sympathy.
The D.A. is beginning
to get vicious.
When you two gentlemen get over your
argument, tell me who won.
Then I´ll decide on the objection.
Objection sustained.
Your witness, Mr. Bannister.
No questions.
Except...
Yes.
Officer Peters...
...I don´t wish to keep you
from your wife and children...
...any more than the D.A. who was
so concerned about them a moment ago.
But I would like to ask you
one question.
Officer Peters, have you
a wife and children?
Well...
...no.
Thank you. You may step down.
Call your next witness.
I call...
...Arthur Bannister.
It´s unusual, Your Honor, to put a
defense attorney on the witness stand...
...but I´m confident that my client
will make no objection.
He can´t make Bannister testify
against his own client, can he?
Hey, what happened?
This keeps getting
screwier all the time.
I wouldn´t take this step if there
were any more effective means...
...of establishing the evidence.
With my client´s
expressed permission...
Mr. Bannister will take the stand.
Never seen anything like that.
-I thought he was smart!
-None smarter.
You ain´t kidding.
Do you swear to tell...
...the truth and nothing
but the truth...
-...so help you God?
-I do.
State your name.
Arthur Bannister.
Mr. Bannister...
...you are a member of the bar?
I am.
And have been for a number of years.
That is correct.
The defendant, Michael O´Hara, worked
as a member of the crew of your yacht?
Yes.
Did he seem happy in his job?
I beg your pardon?
-You had your back turned...
-Did he seem happy in his job?
-Did you get that answer?
-Reasonably so.
As a matter of fact, wasn´t he
threatening to quit?
Yes.
Did you know, Mr. Bannister,
that right after the murders...
...right after the murders we found
the defendant´s bags packed...
...in readiness for
an immediate departure?
In your experience as an attorney,
would this not indicate...
...premeditation?
The district attorney´s
making speeches...
Premeditation and flight!
Making speeches
and drawing conclusions.
-I am not drawing conclusions!
-You are!
He is asking improper questions
in order to influence the jury.
I must ask Your Honor to declare
a mistrial.
Overruled.
Exception.
No further questions.
Would Your Honor kindly explain
to the jury...
...that since the district attorney´s
put me in the position of a witness...
...that I am committed, as the defense
attorney, to cross examine myself?
These are more of the persuasive
Mr. Bannister´s trial tactics.
The jury is so instructed.
Question:
Mr. Bannister, did the defendant say
anything as to why he took the job?
Answer: Yes, Mr. Bannister.
Be reminded that Mr. Bannister had to
go to the seamen´s hiring hall...
...and use his persuasive powers
to convince the defendant...
...to take the job. Question:
Can you think of anything else
that is relevant to this inquiry?
Well, I found this boy
to be clean-cut...
...courageous, resourceful, honest...
...hardworking. Question:
Mr. Bannister, please answer
the question yes or no.
Can you think of anything else
that is relevant to this issue?
Answer: No.
Very well.
Thank you, Mr. Bannister.
You may step down.
Your Honor...
...I have a subpoena for a witness
who´s in the courtroom.
May I have the bailiff serve it?
Bailiff?
You will serve the subpoena.
I call Mrs. Arthur Bannister.
There´s no law that says
she has to take that, is there?
-Don´t be silly, she´s gotta take it.
-Who says there is?
Sit down and mind your own business.
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth...
...the whole truth, so help you God?
-I do.
-State your name.
Mrs. Arthur Bannister.
Mrs. Bannister...
...did you ever have guards
to police your house...
...or the yacht on which
you just cruised?
-No.
-Why?
We never felt the need of it.
You have no children, have you?
I have no children.
You have no children.
So you were never concerned about
kidnappers, is that correct?
That is correct.
There was a man employed in your house
and on your husband´s yacht named...
...Sidney Broome?
Yes.
You´ve known Mr. Broome
for several years?
No.
Would it surprise you if I were to
tell you that the detective...
...hired by your husband...
...in divorce cases was Sidney Broome?
The man you employed
in your house as a butler...
...and on your husband´s yacht,
who was murdered?
-I object!
-Does counsel deny...?
Overruled.
Does counsel deny...
...that Detective Broome
is used by him in divorce cases?
Mrs. Bannister, can you think of any
reason why your husband...
...would want to hire a divorce
detective, other than to watch you?
I object!
Objection sustained.
As a matter of fact, didn´t you
and your husband argue about...
...your showing an infatuation
for O´Hara?
We did not.
Isn´t it a fact that the defendant
O´Hara made advances to you...
...and told you he was
infatuated with you?
He was very respectful.
Speak up, Mrs. Bannister.
He was very respectful.
And I think he was fond of me.
Just what is your definition
of "fond", Mrs. Bannister?
You and Michael O´Hara have kissed
each other, haven´t you?
To name one occasion, you were seen
in the aquarium...
...kissing each other!
Do you deny that?
No.
No further questions.
Your witness, Mr. Bannister.
No questions.
The State Department
refused comment.
Here in San Francisco,
the fate of Black Irish O´Hara...
...notorious agitator, whose trial
for the murder of George Grisby...
...has held the front pages,
remains undecided.
The jury, already out seven hours,
has still returned no verdict.
The whole Black Irish case,
according to...
How long do they take, usually?
Can´t ever tell about a jury.
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Yes?
The jury´s coming out now.
Oh, thank you, Officer McNaulty.
By the way...
...what has Elsa been telling you?
Or did you imagine that I didn´t know
she´s been coming to see you?
-She asked me to trust you.
-But you don´t.
-The jury has reached its verdict.
-Why?
Because I know you wanted me
to be convicted.
Now that it´s too late
to do anything...
...I might as well tell you,
this is one case I´ve enjoyed losing.
I´m coming to see you in the death
house, Michael. Every day.
Our little visits will be great fun.
I´m going to ask for a stay
of execution.
I really hope it´ll be granted.
I want you to live as long
as possible before you die.
You´re talking kind of tough,
aren´t you, Mr. Bannister?
I´ve got an edge. I know you´re
going to the gas chamber.
Don´t be so sure.
I know the killer.
I know who murdered Grisby.
Michael?
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
do you have a verdict?
-We, the jury...
-Wait a minute!
Poison! Poison pills!
Bring him to my chambers!
Get that doctor!
I talked to the doctor.
Said to keep him on his feet.
-We need help.
-I can´t hold this crowd by myself.
The way I understand it, he´ll be
all right if we keep him moving.
-I need help!
-lf he sleeps, he´s done for.
Done for? Well!
I need two officers to control
the crowd in my courtroom!
I´ll try and get rid of the reporters.
You´ll do no such thing! I´ll see
them. I´ll see the reporters myself.
We have to prepare a statement.
That´s it, keep him walking.
All right, Mr. Galloway.
No pictures, please!
Stay close together while I
escort you out to dinner.
-It's him.
-What can we do?
We gotta think of something.
That´s another jury
from another trial across there.
He´s walking out with them!
The judge hopes you will arrive at
a verdict as soon as possible.
That way! Come on.
My goodness! My window!
My chessboard.
McNaulty! Officer Fishbein!
I expect a full report from you.
Get off the floor, Officer Fishbein.
-No pictures.
-What happened?
That woman´s too nice-looking
to have stolen that jewelry.
Jury duty´s such a responsibility,
don´t you think?
You were told not to talk about the
case. Don´t let it happen again.
Elsa!
Hello, Li?
Hello.
-Why did you do it?
-I didn´t. I´m not guilty.
Oh, the pills, you mean. The pills.
I saw you begging me to swallow.
Begging me with your eyes.
You didn´t mean for me to take
them all. I held some back.
I took too many of the pills.
I´m faint.
And now what?
Don´t you know they´ll catch you?
I´ve got to find that gun.
Gun? What gun?
The gun that killed Grisby.
It´ll prove I´m innocent.
Well, I phoned our servant Li.
We´re trying to arrange something.
Someplace to take you.
Just wait here quietly
and watch the play.
The police.
Put your arms around me.
Don´t move.
Don´t you move.
I told you not to move.
I mean it.
I found the gun.
You killed Grisby. Yes!
You´re the killer.
I was right.
She was the killer.
She killed Grisby.
Now she was going to kill me.
Li and his friends smuggled me out and
hid me where I´d be safe from the cops.
Not safe from her.
One of the Chinese worked
at an amusement park.
It was closed for the season. An empty
amusement park makes a good hideout...
...and she wanted me hidden.
Well, I came to...
...in the crazy house.
And for a while there...
...I thought it was me that was crazy.
After what I´d been through,
anything crazy at all...
...seemed natural.
But now I was sane
on one subject. Her.
I knew about her.
She planned to kill Bannister.
She and Grisby.
Grisby was to do it for a share of
Bannister´s money.
That´s what Grisby thought.
Of course she meant to kill Grisby
too, after he´d served his purpose.
Poor howling idiot, he never even
did that. He went and shot Broome.
And that was not part of the plan.
Broome might have got to
the police before he died.
And if the cops traced it to Grisby
and the cops made him talk...
...he´d spill everything...
...and she´d be finished. So she
had to shut up Grisby, but quick.
And I was the fall guy.
In here.
We´re less likely to be heard.
I thought it was your husband
you wanted to kill.
Why don´t you try to understand?
George was supposed to
take care of Arthur.
But he lost his silly head
and shot Broome.
After that, I knew
I couldn´t trust him.
He was mad.
He had to be shot.
And what about me?
We could have gone off together.
Into the sunrise.
You and me? Or you and Grisby?
I love you.
One who follows his nature keeps
his original nature in the end.
But haven´t you heard ever of
something better to follow?
No.
I knew I´d find you two together.
If I hadn´t, Elsa, I might have gone on
playing it your way.
You didn´t know that...
...but you did plan for me
to follow you.
You´ve been drinking.
I presume you think that if you
murder me here...
...your sailor friend will get
the blame.
You´ll be free to
spend my money.
Well, dear, you aren´t the only one
who wants me to die.
Our good friend,
the district attorney...
...is just itching to open a letter
that I left with him.
The letter tells all
about you, lover.
So you´d be foolish to
fire that gun.
With these mirrors it´s
difficult to tell.
You are aiming at me, aren´t you?
I´m aiming at you, lover.
Of course, killing you
is killing myself.
It´s the same thing.
But you know, I´m pretty
tired of both of us.
You know, for a smart girl,
you make a lot of mistakes.
You should have let me live.
You´re gonna need a good lawyer.
He and George...
...and now me!
Like the sharks,
mad with their own blood.
Chewing away at their own selves.
It´s true.
I made a lot of mistakes.
You said the world´s bad
and we can´t run away from that.
You´re right there.
But you said we can´t fight it. We
must deal with the badness, make terms.
And then the badness deal with you.
Make its own terms
in the end, surely.
You can fight, but what good is it?
Goodbye.
You mean we can´t win?
No, we can´t win.
Give my love to the sunrise.
We can´t lose either.
Only if we quit.
And you´re not going to?
Not again.
Oh, Michael...
...I´m afraid.
Michael?

Michael?
Please!
I don´t want to die!
I don´t want to die!
I went to call the cops, but I knew
she´d be dead before they got there.
And I´d be free.

Stupid is more like it.

is to grow old.
So I guess I´ll concentrate on that.
Maybe I´ll live so long...
...that I´ll forget her.
Maybe I´ll die trying.
