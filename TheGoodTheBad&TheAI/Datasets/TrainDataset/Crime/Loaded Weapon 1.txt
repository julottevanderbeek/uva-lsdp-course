Yuck.
Oh, baby.
Namaste.

Open up the cash reg¡ster

You've reached the desk
of Sergeant Wes Luger.
- Yeah, Wes? It's me, B¡lly.
- Hey! / said after the beep!
- Excuse me
-
- L¡sten, ¡t's 9.36...
-
Oh. 9.37.
Look, ¡t's just gett¡ng too dangerous
to wa¡t here. I gotta get out.
Meet me at the Squealer's Hotel ¡n about
- Who is it?
-  Uwwwilderness Girls!
- Wilderness Girls!
- Little late to be sellir cookies.
Troop Leader says
we are not meeting our quota.
- I'll take a couple of boxes.
- That won't be necessary, Miss York.
I gotta be honest.
You look better in the wig.
My hairstyle
is the least of your worries.
Wilderness Girls, eh?
So that's how you're moving the drugs.
Brilliant, Miss York. Now...
- Ze meecrofilm.
- I don't know anything about it.
Don't play coy wiz me.
This is too important.
And zis is the plot.
Important enough so that anyone
in earshot should listen to every detaiI?
- That important.
- You're talking about the microfilm...
...which holds the recipe for turning
cocaine into innocent-looking cookies?
- Yes.
- I don't know anything about it.
In a little while, Miss York...
No, no. I'll beg now.
Save yourself unnecessary pain. Tell me!
- McCracken.
- Thank you, Miss York.
Is that Dan McCracken
or Mike McCracken?
Mike.
-
-
Is he on Alpine or Oak?
Alpine.
-
-
Hey! Psst!
Park on Third.
You'll never find a spot on Alpine.
Thank you.
You have been most co-operative.
- Don't mention it.
-
And you. Remember.
-
- Ow!
One raspberry push-up and one limeade.
-
- What you got, Irv?
Oh... it beats me, Sarge.
Dandruff, seborrhoea,
maybe just dry, itchy scalp.
Have you tried this? I use it.
Head & Shoulders?
But Sarge, you don't have dandruff!
I know.
-
- Are you ready to limbo? Whoo!
- What'll it be? Matt finish or glossy?
- Matt.
Good choice.
- It'll be ready in about a week.
-  One more time!
What are we looking at here, Doc?
The worst-dressed stiff I've ever seen.
We pounded a beat together
for five years. Show some respect.
I'm sorry, Wes.
I see so much of this senseless mayhem
that I get a little insensitive.
OK. This loser has taken the chickenshit
way out and punched her own ticket.
Suicide, huh?
She must've caught herself by surprise.
Found these on the floor near her.
Wilderness Girl cookies.
- Would you give me a hand there, Doc?
- Sure.
Thanks.
You knew her, Sarge?
Yeah. I knew her. She was my partner.
I'm sorry, Sarge.
Hey. Hey, Sarge?
- It's tingling!
- Good, Irv. That means it's working.
Here's to gettir through
another lousy day.
Claire...
Oh, Claire.
I miss you so much.
I'm tryir, Claire.
God knows, I'm tryir.
But it's too damn hard without you.
-
- I'll get the bastards that took you.
- Well, Herb, back to the salt mines.
- Yeah. Mind if I drive this time?
- Lady, if you didrt resist so much...
- Do not put me on hold again!
This is supposed to be an express line!
This guy's got 14 counts!
No, he had fuller lips. Pouting lips.
Wide eyes.
- Hey, Dooley! Give it a break, man.
- What's going on?
Dooley's bet us
he can escape in 15 minutes.
- How long's he been at it?
- Three days.
You better step on it.
What the hell is everyone
doir? What's the big idea!
You think crime's takir a holiday?!
Think again! What the hell you want?!
- I want the York case.
- There is no York case! It was suicide!
-  Coffee?
- No, thanks.
Cappuccino? Espresso?
Scotty! Can you get this machine to work?
I've given her all she's got, Captain.
If I push her any harder, she'll blow!
Give me my plate!
I don't think York was a suicide.
She was onto something.
On something is more like it!
Those cookies were laced with cocaine!
No wonder I couldn't eat just one.
York left me a message. She'd uncovered
drug runners. That's what got her killed.
- You don't think it was bullets?
- Give me the case.
You're days from retirement. Let it go.
Let it go?!
York was a partner. A friend. I owe her!
I owe it to every cop who's ever walked
a beat and laid his life on the line!
Wait a minute! I'm the captain here!
I do all the yelling!
- If it's that important, take the case!
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Captain.
- Don't be so fast to thank me!
You gonna be naked on this one! It's on
the line! You blow it, you're goir down!
You gonna be hung out to dry! Drop the
ball and you'll be twistir in the wind!
Embarrass this department,
and your pants will be dancing with figs!
- Is that clear?!
- Everything but the pants-fig thing.
Narco's sending one of their burned-out
psychos to look into the cookies!
- I'm teamir him with you!
- Captain, you know I work alone.
You get the case, you get Jack Colt!
Cigarette!
- Cigarette! Hit the floor!
- Cancer stick!
- Hey! Back off!
- Easy.
That's Luger's new partner!
You can't seriously be thinking
of using this man.
He's dangerous! A menace!
A loose cannon. A walking time bomb.
Most of all, he is gun-happy.
Where do you get off sayir that?
I give up.
There's someone you better talk to
if this case involves cookies.
- Not him.
- Yeah. Him!
You know the rules.
Do not touch the glass.
Do not hand him any sharp instruments,
power tools, sewing items or condiments.
Stay to the left when you walk
down the hall. He's in the last cell.
The right! I meant stay to the right!
- Yah!
-
Untie my fetters.
What?
Untie my fetters.
-  Oompah-pah?
-  Untie my fetters!
Is it a code?
An... obscure foreign language?
Aaaaah!
Ouch.
So this is Mr "Screw with your brain,
eat your spleen...
...wear your flesh as a hairnet" Leacher,
huh? Look who's Mr Scaredy-Pants now.
Waaah!
Identification, please.
Closer.
Closer.
Please. Sit.
Dr Leacher, we need to ask you...
There's someone out there again,
isrt there?
- A bad boy with pastries.
- Yes!
Hai Karate.
You wear that sometimes, don't you?
But not today.
Today, it's... mentholated Deep Heat rub.
You order chef's salad
with dressing on the side.
You have a wife with perky breasts...
...a nine-year-old son
and a sixteen-year-old daughter.
- Who told you that?
- I saw their picture in your wallet.
We came here to talk about cookies.
Quid pro quo, Mr Colt.
What's that mean?
It means I'm pretentious.
Tell me about the worst meal
you've ever eaten, Mr Colt. Quick!
Uh... it was a fish sandwich at, um...
Don't tell him anything!
Now, can you help us?
You hold the key, Mr Colt.
Look into yourself
for an answer to the cookie concern.
Look to a man
with whom you were involved.
No, no. Not him. It was in Vietnam.
No, no. You disappoint me, Mr Colt.
It was Mortars. General Mortars.
- Wait a minute! I never...
- I didrt mean that kind of involvement.
- Oh.
- You were under his command.
Mortars was my patient.
- I taught him to express his anger.
- You taught him well.
Quite. After our last session,
he started the Vietnamese war.
Seek him out.
And... when you find him...
...with some fava beans
and a nice chilled Fresca.
I just gotta ask.
What does human flesh taste like?
Chicken.
Are we gonna see Mortars?
Follow the lead of a mind-twisting,
jumpsuit-wearing sociopath?
Forget it. I've only got 48 hours.
Wrong, Sarge. 47 hours, 29 minutes.
- I'm looking for my ex-partner's killer.
- Come on, Spud! This way!
She was meeting some stoolie
at the Squealer's Hotel.
- I'm innocent!
- I don't need a hotshot cowboy...
- They're gonna fry me!
- Not validated.
- What?
- Va... li... da... ted.
What I don't need is a hotshot cowboy
from Narco gettir in my way. You got it?
Listen, pal, you're not the only one
who lost a partner. I...
- You got anything smaller?
- Keep it.
- Anything larger?
- Yeah.
Claire and I rode together
for seven years.
York and I were in Academy together.
Then we partnered for five years.
Before that,
we dodged the draft together.
Before that, we played
high-school football together.
Before that,
we were in grade school together.
And before that, we breast-fed together.
What happened to your partner?
I don't know.
I came home and she was gone.
You were living together?
Hell, she'd sleep at my feet
and lick my toes.
Though sometimes
she'd just lick herself for hours.
Huh. I don't think it's such a good idea
to get that involved with your partner.
...with a partner who saves your life,
then nuzzles your crotch.
Billy and I didrt have
that kind of relationship.
She left the force about five years ago.
We didrt see each other much after...
...but when we did,
she was excited to see me.
When Claire was excited,
she'd pee on my leg.
- What do you think happened to her?
- Maybe she just took off.
I didrt pay enough attention to her.
I realised when she shit in my shoes.
But my gut tells me
we were getting too close to someone.
I had a feeling we were being followed.
You may be right.
I think we're being followed now.
Don't look! Just play it cool.
So, uh... did you catch that
Stallone retrospective?
I'm gonna try and lose 'em.
- Nice driving.
- Thanks.
# You got me so
/ don't know what /'m doir- yeah!
# You
Really got me now
- # Oh, yeah, you've really got me now
-  # Yeah
# You got me so
I don't know what I'm doing
- # You got me so I can't sleep at night
- # Yeah, you really got me
# You really got me
Huh!
# You really got me
Ptoo!
- # Don't ever set me free...
-
What the hell?
General.
How's your health, Mike?
Fine.
- Sea-Monkeys?
- Pirana.
Their lives exude
a beautiful simplicity:
...savage, ruthless,
existing only to devour and destroy...
Sounds like me, right?
In its own environment, the pirana is
a killer. In mine, just a helpless fish.
There's a lesson to be learned from that,
don't you think?
Mike...
-
- ...I have a concern you might alleviate.
Certain information
was shared with an individual...
...who might have jeopardised the cookie
operation. While they were eliminated...
...we have yet to recover
a very important item.
Where is the microfilm, Mike?
I don't know. I gave it to York.
I thought she was one of your men.
- Act in haste, repent in leisure.
- But he who hesitates is lost.
- Never judge a book by its cover.
- What you see is what you get.
- Loose lips sink ships.
- Life is very short...
...and there's no time
for fussing and fighting, my friend.
Sorry, Mike, no good.
You've been careless. Sloppy.
We just can't have that.
Where's the microfilm, Mike?
Please... I don't have it...
Does this have anything to do with
the Billy York killing?
Nah. Domestic dispute.
OK, I'm gonna try and talk 'em out.
Hold your fire untiI I give the order!
Anata wa kira desu!
Watashi wa Sergeant Luger desu!
Can I have one that's made in America?
You up there!
I order you to throw your hands down
and come out with your weapons up!
-
- Who fired that shot?
- Sergeant. That was me.
- Give it to me.
- Well, you see, I was just...
- Glve me the gun!
When you learn to follow orders,
you can have it back.
Oh, so we think that's funny,
do we, Officer... Davis
Well, maybe we'd a//
like to know what's so funny!
Maybe Officer Davis
can make us a// laugh.
Nice to see
all those smiling faces out there!
Say, what do you call 2,000 lawyers
at the bottom of the sea?
- A good start!
-
Why'd the guy name his penis?
He didrt want a stranger
making most of his decisions!
Thanks a lot. You've been great.
Make sure he doesn't get any doughnuts.
You could've gone lighter on the guys.
That's how it starts.
You lighten up, next thing you know...
- Tight-ass.
- You say something?
Uh-uh.
Pencil-neck.
Butthead.
What is it with you guys?
I run a respectable place!
What are you arrestir me for?
I got friends downtown.
I don't know what you're talkir about!
- We haven't said anything yet.
- I got nothir to say!
Park the tongue, buddy! I'm Sergeant
Colt. This is Sergeant Luger.
Did you know a woman named Billy York?
You got a picture?
Here we go.
- That her?
- No, that's her picture.
Nope, don't know her.
Well, maybe this
will refresh your memory.
She's a little out of focus.
Is this the Billy York informant
shoot-out?
I don't know, I just got here.
Wait a second.
Hey, Larry! Larry!
Is this the Billy York informant
shoot-out?
- Nah. Check out the third floor.
- Thanks.
Beat it.
This is an FBI case.
All right, bring him on out.
Is he the York informant?
Get your shit together, will ya?
That's Becker, 403.
Hey, you!
Not so fast.
That's better!
No! I'll handle this.
All right, Becker, open up! Police!
Now that we've tried it your way,
let's try mine.
- Who is it?
- Rrrrroom service!
Whadda-whadda what? I don't know
nothir! I airt sayir nothir!
Nothing! The word is nothing,
not nothir. It has an "ing" on the end.
OK. Nothing. No... thing.
Nothiiiiiiiiiiing!
- OK? You happy
- That's better.
- That's not what you told York.
- I don't know no York. Where's my food?
We ate it.
And please, no double negatives.
You don't know any York?
These matches say you're lying.
Oh! Oh, York.
She was supposed to meet you
the night she died. Why?
- It's where I live.
- Yeah, but why you?
The other guy
couldn't come up with the deposit.
- What do you know about microfilm?
- It's small, and, uh... brittle...
- ...and it's used in a lot of Bond films.
-
All right! I did money laundering for
your standard ex-military psycho types.
- Give me a name.
- Arert your parents supposed to do it?
- Who are you working with?
- I can't say!
- There's been three attempts on my life!
- Come with us, and there won't be more.
All right, but you gotta understand,
this thing is bigger than Watergate!
It's bigger than Oprah! There's nothing
you can do cos they're too powerful!
And they're too... je ne sais quoi.
We can protect you.
La commedia... è fini...
Guess that's the last time
he'll trust a cop.
-
- Give it to me straight. Is this it?
Level with me. How bad is it?
It's not bad. You'll be fine.
You'll be back on your feet in no time.
- Your ticket.
- Don't bury me, I'll only be a minute.
OK, you two. Just a little closer
together. OK, big smile.
Beautiful.
They bought it right away.
Those two tried to make a getaway.
- They gave me a new partner, too.
-
This is Sport.
- She likes you.
- I've done worse.
- What are we looking at here?
- Mixed breed.
Rottweiler and Chihuahua.
I guess they used a lubricant.
- I'm talking about the case.
- Oh.
Seeing Sport, I think I could love again.
- What do you have, Irv?
- Oh, I'm not sure, Sarge.
It's a nagging, itching,
burning sensation.
What the hell do you expect?
Your foot's on fire.
-
- What you got, Sarge?
Well... nothing solid.
- You got any theories?
- E equals mc squared.
Anything of your own?
No. I'll tell you, Sarge,
something just doesn't add up.
- What?
-  Get her off me!
My wife and I haven't had sex for two
years. I have a six-month-old daughter.
Irv, Irv, you're getting too suspicious.
This job will do that to you.
You're right, Sarge. Thanks.
-  OK, smile.
- How's this?
- Goodness!
- Hey, buddy, want to give me a hand?
I don't know,
this may /ook like a suicide...
...but my gut tells me
there's something else going on.
-
- Hey, uh...
...werert there five stiffs?
Damn! McCrackers missing!
- Hey! Anyone seen McCrackers body?
-  Thanks, Lefty.
I need a little help here!
He didrt just get up and walk away!
- What?
- I got something important to show you.
So... what's the big news?
See this? This ring was given out to a
CIA front in 'Nam run by General Mortars.
When the VC tried financing the war
with cocaine, they burned it.
Twelve years later, Mortars and his men
went into the drug business.
- Ticket?
- I could never prove it.
Are you saying you took evidence from
the scene of a criminal investigation?
- Do you want to crack this case?
- Not by making up the rules as I go!
Sometimes, pal,
those are the only rules that work!
- Good thing we use valet parking.
- Taxi!
Guess we're making somebody nervous.
It's gonna take more than
a couple of car bombs to stop us.
Not a hell of a lot more.
Don't worry about all this bomb stuff.
It happens to me all the time.
I'm not. I'm trying to figure out
what to tell my wife about her car.
Understand, gentlemen,
if you wish to do business with us...
- ...you must take the entire shipment.
- Test the merchandise.
Half the payment now, half tomorrow...
...half on delivery.
The price is not negotiable.
- The merchandise is satisfactory, yes?
-
Good. Then we can do business.
Use the Vista card.
You get frequent flyer miles.
The shipment will be prepared and boxed
Friday evening, for shipping Saturday.
I need a signature
and daytime pheune number.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Not so fast.
- The carbons?
- Smart man.
I like doing business with smart men.
They know never to screw with me.
There's something between you
and this General Mortars.
He was my CO in 'Nam.
The CIA listed him as MIA,
but the VA ID'd his MO...
- ...and we put out an APB.
- Oh, I see.
- May I help you?
- It can't be! Not Mary O'Brien...
...the buck-toothed, freckle-faced,
pigtailed girl I knew in fifth grade?
No, I'm not. May I help you?
I'm Sergeant Luger. Sergeant Colt.
These are our wallets.
-  Ow!
- May we speak to whomever's in charge?
Follow me.
Miss Demeanor will be right with you.
Help yourself to some cookies.
Let me do the talking.
I've eaten their cookies.
You're the boss.
Detectives Colt and Loser?
- Lu-ger.
- Oh, sorry. Loogie.
Hm... Why don't you make yourselves
at home?
No, I meant why don't you sit down
and tell me what you want?
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Uh... just water.
No, thanks.
We are investigating a felony,
Miss Demeanor.
Oh, it sounds violent... I hate violence!
- Anyone for snow cones?
- Thanks!
During the course of investigating
two homicides...
...we found boxes of Wilderness Girl
cookies. They were laced with cocaine.
Oh, my! That's horrible!
But you can't suspect the Wilderness
Girls of somehow being responsible?
I can. I'd like you to come downtown
and answer a few questions.
OK.
- This is downtown.
- Headquarters.
- You can have your attorney present.
- Why would I need my attorney?
- May I change before I go?
- Sure.
- You should always wear your hair down.
- For you, I always will.
Look, lady, you may think you can
divert our attention. But you're wrong.
We see through your tricks.
Now move it.
Do you run the Wilderness Girls?
Yes.
- Is your money raised selling cookies?
- Yes.
- Do you know General Mortars?
- Well, I drive a Buick.
No, that's General Mortars. Mor... tars.
- No.
- And that's one down, nine to go.
Hi, how you doir? Don't mind me.
Just keep doir what you're doir.
We're a team. Hey, honey! Nice outfit.
Points out all the tourist attractions!
- Didrt you die?
- I thought this was a sequel.
Miss Demeanor,
this would not be a good time to lie.
- When is
- I don't know the meaning of the word.
- Who was the last man to bat over 400?
- Ted Williams.
- What did Cher see in Sonny?
- Did Oswald act alone?
- Need help shaving your legs?
- Show a little respect!
- So, how many men have you slept with?
-
- Five. Maybe six.
- Not a lot for this day and age.
It's been a slow week.
- Do you know Bill York?
- Who cares? Do you sleep in the nude?
- Only when I'm naked.
- How do you feel about the...
- ...designated-hitter rule?
- I hate it.
It undermines the purity of the game.
I like pure things.
They give me pleasure.
Here we go. God...
Yes!
-
- Oh, yes!
- Oh... oh...
- Aoow!
We've detained Miss Demeanor
long enough. Um...
You can go now.
Sorry to have troubled you.
No trouble. But I'll need transportation
home. Anybody want to give me a ride?
-  Pick me! Pick me!
-  Back off!
If I were you, I wouldn't leave town.
Oh, I won't. I live here.
- Sorry if it was a little rough on you.
- You're just doing your job.
And I'm just a gal like any other gal.
I want a home, a family...
I used a rolled-up newspaper
to spank Claire once.
Thanks for bringing me back.
It was nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you, too.
- I hope it was a successful performance.
- Yeah.
Good. I think we may have stumbled on
the whereabouts of the microfilm.
Mr Jigsaw,
use your powers of persuasion...
...and see if York left our police friends
a little memento.
They're not onto you.
No more innocent people have to suffer.
You're letting compassion intrude.
It's an unbecoming trait.
Who the hell are you?
I am your worst nightmare.
No, waking up without my penis
is my worst nightmare.
OK. All right.
So I'm not your worst nightmare,
but I'm right up there!
- Now. Where is the meecrofilm?
- What's going on here?
- Drop your gun, Mr Luger!
- I don't have one.
- You are not carrying a uwwweapon?
- I don't believe in them.
Pick up the gun!
Drop the gun, Mr Luger!
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun...
- ...or I shoot your partner.
- He's gonna shoot me anyway.
If you drop it, we're both dead.
Do it, Wes. Shoot him.
Come on, shoot him!
Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him!
Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him!
Do it, Wes!
Shoot him, Wes! Shoot him!
Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him!
Drop the gun!
Get the car!
Freeze!
-
-
- Damn!
-
So you let him get away, huh?
He's gone, Colt.
Why not come home with me?
A family environment can offer so much
more than your hate-filled existence.
Maybe some other time.
Sergeant Colt. This is Sergeant Luger.
We're commandeering your vehicles.
- We're commandeering kids' bikes?!
- Yeah.
That's disgusting.
I'm getting too old
for this bike-confiscating shit.
Don't worry, kids.
We'll take good care of your bikes.
Oooaargh!
I can't imagine where Doris is.
She always checks out my new partners.
Daddy, this is Mom's
"bowling with the Teamsters" night.
Oh! Yeah, right.
So, Ben...
Dad help you with your homework?
Nah.
I don't want to repeat fifth grade again.
So, Debbie... how do you like school?
Here's Doris now. Hon, I want you
to meet my new partner, Jack Colt.
- We've been working together today.
- Charmed, I'm sure.
Um... this is Ted Polansky.
Ted's a produce manager.
Assistant produce manager.
Mr Brubaker's the manager.
Ted's been very helpful
with my produce selections...
...and I thought I should extend him
a special courtesy.
- I should be going.
- Oh, no. Stay for coffee. Coffee, Ted?
- Ted's from a dysfunctional family.
- Oh. So no coffee.
He should spend time with us.
I was thinking of taking him
to Mother's for the weekend.
-
-  Uh... dear?
I know you're just blocking out
the memory...
...but come on. Your mom's been dead
for over six months.
Uh-oh.
Did I forget to give you that message?
-
-  I'll pass on coffee.
Did I come at a bad time?
You should be more careful.
I could have blasted off your eye shadow.
So, what's with all the candles?
I couldn't find the light switch.
You have an interesting place.
It's much bigger
than it looks from the outside.
I chose light colours
to make it look bigger.
- So what are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.
- I mean, what brought you here?
- A taxi.
- Yeah, but why?
- My car's in the shop.
I mean, why the hell did you come here?
- The police station made me nervous.
- You better go.
You're not even gonna ask me
why I tracked you down?
OK, why did you track me down?
I wasrt totally honest
with you and Detective Loogie.
- No-one ever is.
- I can't live with it any more!
I know who's responsible
for those cookies.
It's a man I fell for.
A man who used me and betrayed me.
- General Mortars.
- Why are you telling me all this?
You don't understand.
He's using the Wilderness Girls
of America to sell cocaine!
He can ship them anywhere! Everyone
trusts a Wilderness Girl cookie!
Oh, my.
I feel as though
an incredible weight has been...
- Can you feel it?
- As a matter of fact, I can.
- Isn't it wonderfu/?
- Yes.
- And there's more.
- More?
Yes. Tomorrow at midnight, a drug deal
at the Wilderness Girl cookie factory.
You and Loogie must stop it.
But not untiI after.
After what?
- Relax, Colt.
-
I'll talk you through it. Squeeze me.
Squeeze me like I was an S&W
...with a chrome eight-inch barrel
begging for a few squirts of gun oiI.
- Is this a come-on?
- Shh.
Blow in my ear like you'd blow away
the discharge from your barrel...
- Ouch!
- What?
- Painful cuticle.
- You think that's painful? Razor burn.
Retaining water.
Nickel-beer night. Dodger Stadium.
- And these? Vietnam?
- Parochial school.
Grenade.
- Riot at a Love Connection taping.
- That's nothing.
Plate in my head.
Elective surgery. I was a fool.
-
- Try this.
- Low-budget organ transplant.
-
Colt. Enough foreplay.
We were made for each other.
That was magic, Colt.
I guess you're crying cos you know it's
wrong to get mixed up with a guy like me.
A guy who lives on the edge
and plays by his own rules.
A guy who can only spell heartache
for a woman like you.
No. I'm crying because
now that we've had these moments...
...and I'm so friendly
with the villain...
Well, some things are won'th dying for.
Colt! Where are you going?
Nowhere.
I'm just taking one of those unmotivated
"butt in the moonbeam" walks.
- Do you hear something?
-
Nah!
What the hell are you doir?
Uh... is this 1014 Pacific Coast Highway?
- Huh?
- 1014 Pacific Coast Highway!
No! This is 814 Pacific Coast Highway!
Sorry! My mistake!
Yeah! No problem
No problem
Colt, look!
It's Mortars, I know it.
I'm gettir the hell outta here.
- Ouch! That's mine!
- Gimme that!
- Take care, babe.
- Colt?
Next time, instead of just smoking
in bed, could we actually make love?
- Yeah, maybe.
- Colt, please.
I want you. I'm burning for you.
I'm on fire.
- And I'm late.
- It'll only take a minute.
Who told you that?
-
- P/ease. Don't you find me desirable?
Sure. But I got a partner to warn.
Hey! Whoa! What are you doir?
Hey! Get your hands off me!
Luger!
Are you crazy? Not that one!
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm saving your life.
Look, it's always the green one.
- Yeah, but that one's orange.
- Who asked you, anyway?
Not that I'm drawir
any parallels here...
...but don't you think it's kinda weird
that you're doing this...
- ...and in Hot Shots...
- All right, Becker, that's it.
- This one's got your name on it.
- Oh, no, no!
Aaaaaargh!
Oops.
Urrrhurgh... eeh!
Luger! Where are you?
- Luger?
- In here.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Taking a shit.
-
- Sorry.
Bust at a cookie factory?
I don't know. Can you trust her?
- Yeah.
- How do you know? You kissed her?
- Well, sort of.
- French?
Give her a hickey?
Shaved her back? Handled her hooters?
- Parked the pink Cadillac?
- Nope.
- What can you know about her?
- I know we wear the same size pumps.
Are you one of those macho guys
who hates women?
If I tell you something, do you promise
it'll just stay between us?
Your secret's safe with me. Whatever you
tell me won't leave this car. I promise.
My mother never breast-fed me.
She'd... tease me with it
and then give me the bott/e.
Went on for years.
Lufthansa announces the departure...
/ deve/oped a /ove-hate thing
with breasts and a distrust of a// women.
I just don't understand 'em.
He//, / breast-fed ti/// was 16,
and / still don't understand women.
While we're sharing so openly here...
...I appreciate what you did today,
coming to warn me like that.
Most people I know
wouldn't have done that.
That's the advantage
of working with strangers.
You're tellir me that a guy dressed like
a Wilderness Girl with a German accent...
- Austrian?
- Austrian, yeah.
...and tonight, there's a drug deal
at the cookie factory?
- Do I have that straight?
- It sounds crazy, but...
It is crazy!
Consider this investigation closed!
It was nice almost working with you
You can't quit now. We've come too far.
You heard him. We're off the case.
You're more hung up on going
by the book than solving this case.
Oh, no!
By failing to follow the safety guard's
manual, look what I've done!
I'm to blame. I didrt go by the rules.
It's all my fault.
From this day forward...
You were a crossing guard?
You guys were all geeks!
And what's your problem?
You got some kind of death wish?
/f he on/y knew.
/t was C/aire who /ived /ife on the edge.
It's hard for you to understand.
You got a family. All I got is revenge.
I'm gonna naiI Mortars
for those killings.
You're headed in the right direction...
...but you're doing
all the wrong things to get there.
Oh, really, Mr Perfect
Well, aren't we forgetting something?
I thought I was getting through to you.
Sometimes you can't play by the rules.
Well, I'm goir after Mortars,
alone and by myself.
-
-
What Russian novel,
embracing more than 500 characters...
- ...is set in the Napoleonic Wars?
- War and Peace!
-
- Das war nur der Wind.
Der Mortars ist schwer sauer.
Es ist zu spät für Plotpunkte.
Keine Sorge.
Nur ein Affe würde hierherkommen.
Ja, vielleicht.
- Yaaah!
-
I have been uwwwaiting
for this moment, Mr Colt.
Hooaaaw!
- Yaah!
-
- Waah!
- Aaaaaargh!
This has gone far enough!
First you use my affection...
...then you use me to sell drugs
through the Wilderness Girls!
- What kind of a man are you?
- A user.
I knew that when you made me parade
in a leather demi-cup underwire bra...
- ...matching panties and garter belt.
- Is that the bra with the metal studs?
That's the red one! I mean the black set
with gold-thread piping.
- Always loved that one.
- I hate it.
But most of all,
I hate that you made me lure Colt here.
- The man I've come to love.
- "The man..."? Don't be foolish.
All right, General, playtime's over.
- Colt!
- Destiny. I was moved by what you said.
I meant it, Colt. I love you.
No, not that!
I meant the black leather outfit.
Oh.
General, your cookie's crumbled.
Perhaps you should see this first.
- Claire!
-
Let her go, General.
Yeah. Let her go and keep me.
- No!
- Oh... OK.
Keep her and let me go.
Keep everybody but me!
- Why should I listen to any of you?
- Because you want this.
Oh... I underestimated you, son.
Thank you. I'll take that.
All right, Mr Colt. The game is up.
- Put your weapon down.
- Put down yours, General!
You won't shoot me, angel buns.
You haven't got the...
-
- ...guts!
- Haaah! Yaah!
- Aaaaaargh!
- Waah!
-
Hai! Huu! Nya! Huh!
Nya! Nya! Nya!
Yah! Yaaah! Yah! Yah!
- Yah!
- Hold it!
- OK.
-
Colt, look out!
Colt, I'm cold.
I'm so cold...
Thanks.
Kiss me...
May not be a good idea.
I, uh... I got a touch of the flu.
Please, Colt.
Get Mortars for me, Colt.
Give it up, Mortars!
You're only makir things worse!
It's over! The jig is up!
The Rubicon is crossed!
Getting sloppy, son.
Well, it was still sound advice.
-  Drop the gun, General.
- Luger! You came.
That's personal.
But what's important is I'm here.
Shoot him, partner.
Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him!
You can't shoot me. You're
a cop. You have to play it by the book.
Go ahead, Sergeant. Shoot me.
Sometimes, General...
Just kidding.
Nothir like a good smoke after you've
blown someone away. D'you mind?
- Yeah.
- You're right. They're dangerous.
- Looks like you missed the fireworks!
- Wrong! We're just in time!
- So you're a couple of superheroes, huh?
- We got the bad guys, Cap'.
Yeah, and you almost got yourself killed!
Wish I had more men like you.
Look. Would you reconsider
that retirement?
Only if Colt's my partner.
- I think it can be arranged.
- Thanks, Cap'.
Sequel.
I'm driving.
- Who's driving?
- I'm driving.
- I'm driving.
- /'m driving!
OK.
Y'know, I feel like I'm forgetting
something back there.
- Destiny! Claire!
- That's it.
We're here, Colt.
Destiny, Claire... you're all right!
Me too, in case you have
the sensitivity to care
I know you're uncomfortable with me...
...but don't worry, I grow on you.
Kinda like a rash.
