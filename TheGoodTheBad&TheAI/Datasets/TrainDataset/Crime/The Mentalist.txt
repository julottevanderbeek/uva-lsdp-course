A psychic is manipulating
and using subjective energy...
...energy of the non-physical nature...
...in order to achieve a non-effect.
Mentalists, magicians, these types
of folks, they manipulate perception...
...by distraction and some trickery in order
to receive a desired effect or result.
But that's a real long jump
from being a gifted psychic.
I'm not saying it's rubbish.
I'm just saying I've never seen it.
I'd be very happy to believe it
if someone presented me with proof.
I wouldn't equate Patrick Jane's
mental ability with psychic ability.
It's not a paranormal function.
When it comes to believers and skeptics,
sheeps and goats basically...
...you know, there's an old saying,
for believers, no proof is necessary...
...and for skeptics, no proof is possible.
I've never met a real psychic.
It truly does not exist.
There are ways scientifically
to basically explain any bit of anything...
...that can be considered to be
quote-unquote, "psychic phenomenon."
I'm a scientist. I was trained
in how you do the scientific method.
You do experiments,
you replicate your experiment...
...you replicate your data.
But this phenomena
doesn't work like a machine.
When I meet someone
who professes to be a psychic...
...or professes to have
some kind of paranormal ability...
...my simple response inwardly oftentimes
is "prove it."
I tend to disbelieve a lot of what I hear...
...because a substantial portion of what
people learn about in this field is garbage.
I'd say, what, 98 percent of it.
Throw it out, forget it.
It's absolute... Absolutely worthless.
You get to the core of this,
the real researchers, the real people...
...to the real data, it's extraordinary.
But one thing we do know,
if these things never occurred...
...we wouldn't be here discussing it.
If they occur all the time...
...and we could control them,
we wouldn't be here discussing it.
So that means there's an aspect of the
world we live in we know a little bit about.
And we have to ask ourselves,
is it nature versus nurture?
Is someone born in this environment
that's accepting of it...
...so then it's cultivated naturally?
Or is it a genetic component?
I think there might be a little bit of both.
The best analogy to me is
we can all drive cars.
Maybe not as well as others,
but we can all drive.
How many of us have the stamina...
...the endurance,
the hand-eye-foot coordination...
...the reflexes to become a race driver?
And psychic information is not logical,
it's not rational.
It's not linear.
It's just an obtuse perception
of information.
TAFF: The research I did at UCLA,
the lab work...
...part of it developed
into a training program...
...to see if we could take normal,
healthy, emotionally stable people...
...who haven't had any experiences,
to their knowledge, and train it in them.
And going into that world...
...and discerning information and making it
objective, verifiable and factual.
We had thousands of people
come to the program...
...most had no results at all.
But there was a small percentage
on the far end of the spectrum...
...who were, like, athletes,
they were stars.
What that means, why it is,
God only knows.
It may be we're physiologically
or neurologically different.
We're wired different.
And the nature of my ability
is pretty simple.
I'm primarily visual. I get information.
What's called clairvoyance.
Information comes
at a very holistic fashion...
...that resembles hearing, seeing,
all these things.
But it's all internal versus sub...
Versus external.
I know for myself
and a few other people...
...we're very sensitive to changes in the
Earth's magnetic field. Dramatically so.
I'm not actually using my eyes
or using my ears...
...or using my...
You know, any of these... Or hands.
This feeling is not something
that's tangible.
It's more of a sensation
that I have to interpret.
TAFF: The people who are most adept at
this, who responded the most quickly...
...were the most, like,
emotionally unstable.
Did you put a spell on Cody Elkins?
I did.
I put a killing spell on him.
I've done the spell several times before
but this is the first time it's worked.
ROURKE:
Here's a caveat.
When you open the door, so to speak,
you can't really close it.
Once you make yourself aware
to this new aspect of yourself...
...this new way of receiving information,
you will never be the same.
MAN:
Alison!
TAFF: An example,
which is a little more disturbing.
...I'm dreaming that I'm flying a 747.
It was a TWA and I've been a pilot for
years so I know a little bit about aircraft.
And in the dream, we're on approach
to South Africa.
And suddenly, the turbo fans cut out,
the drone goes away.
We're dropping like a stone,
the instruments are dark, we hit.
I fly out of bed, covered in perspiration.
And I remembered,
"My God, a 747 has never gone down."
I didn't know what day
it was gonna happen...
...what time it was gonna happen,
what flight number.
So I could've called TWA,
I could've called the FAA.
I can't do it
because I don't know anything.
Three days later, the first 747 went down
on approach to South Africa.
It was the TWA.
If you did that today, the FBI would be
at your door in probably 20 minutes.
I'm a former supervisory special agent
of the FBI for 27 years.
My main emphasis while I was with
the FBI was the Violent Crime Program...
...which entailed all of kidnappings
throughout the southern California area.
Typically, I get involved
with law enforcement issues...
...in what's called an unofficial capacity.
I'm not able really to comment on some of
the "official" relationships I have.
And all those "official" relationships
are "unofficial."
I think that the relationship
between psychics and law enforcement...
...is somewhat...
...kind of kept in the back, so to speak.
The law enforcement,
they wanna do their job...
...they wanna go out there, investigate it,
find the person who did, make the arrest.
I'm not reaching to say the preconception
about a lot of psychics is they're nuts.
I make and sell Wicca healing powders
on the Internet.
You should check out my website.
Nobody in law enforcement that I know of
goes to the psychic first off.
The police asked me to get a psychic fix
on him...
...to see if I can get a sense
of who this man is.
That's probably the last person
they're gonna go to.
- We are tools. Psychics don't solve crimes.
- They're not stable.
Cody deserved to die.
He was a bad person.
He stole and tortured and killed my cat.
Maybe that's what gives some of them
the ability to do this, when they want.
You would use one when all of your
other avenues have been exhausted.
And if you don't have anything else,
why not?
I've never read a case or seen a show...
...where they actually
did make anything...
...other than the broadest possible
connections to the realities of the case.
ROURKE: Because when we open up
psychically, you know...
...it's a doorway that everything
can come through.
So you'll get things
that are pertinent to the case...
...and things
that are maybe not so pertinent.
It's a technique of generalizing...
...a technique of never quite being able
to pin down what it is they're saying...
...so that eventually they're gonna hit
the right mark.
Yes, I'm feeling that Paul hasn't been
a hundred percent honest with you.
He hasn't been happy.
I have yet to meet one that I think,
in any way, is doing anything...
...other than guessing
and occasionally getting it right.
The blind squirrel
eventually gets the nuts.
During my career in the FBI...
...I did have occasion to work
with different psychics.
Kidnappings tend to lend themselves more
to that field...
...than probably any other investigation...
...with exception to maybe homicides.
They'd give us things to hold
relevant to the crime.
Clothing, artifacts, a wallet,
a piece of jewelry.
It's called psychometry.
It's a very powerful tool
in discerning information.
Because we... Every living thing
has an atmosphere.
You start describing details
about the person...
...like their families, their friends,
mental problems, physical illnesses.
A mentalist can't do that.
But a psychic can.
ROURKE: So let's say that, you know,
a murderer drops the weapon...
...or a victim leaves a shoe
or a bloodstained piece of jewelry...
...and the psychic can use that.
For me, the more graphic something was,
the more easily I was able to see it
TAFF: I haven't done this work in a while
because it's very depressing.
You see these horrible images
in your head.
And if you're very sensitive to this,
emotionally, it's best to just stay away.
We are like the planets in the universe.
We have our own electromagnetic field.
And in that field is stored information
and any property that are on our person...
...or that we hold or manipulate stores
and can store that information.
And we provided graphic details...
...of where the body was,
the instrument of death...
...description of the damage
to the body...
...and they found the person basically
where we described.
Psychic evidence
or evidences attached to a psychic...
...really, it doesn't fall under that umbrella
of evidence.
It's more used as an investigative tool.
I wouldn't walk into a courtroom solely
on a psychic's information...
...and try to get a search warrant
or an arrest warrant.
I have to have corroborating evidence...
...that's going to help me
with that information.
These... The cases are intriguing,
they're spectacular.
But you gotta walk sort of a very
thin line to avoid getting people angry.
Those psychics who do that
tend to be taking advantage...
...of a very highly-charged
emotional situation in small towns...
...where they come in and say,
"I can help."
True demonic evil burns like fire.
It burns with a terrible, cold, dark flame.
I force myself to look into that flame.
And I see an image of the evildoer.
In homicides, kidnappings
and a variety of cases...
...police will withhold information.
And the really good reason
for doing that...
...is there are specific things
that happen during a crime.
And only the person involved in that crime
is gonna be aware of those things.
SONNENBERG:
That's kind of used as a filter.
If anyone needs arresting,
it's Kristina Frye.
She knew that Rosemary was in danger.
She knew where to find the car,
the murder weapon.
Which means that she either
does have supernatural powers...
...or she was involved in the crime.
Filters out those
who think they were there...
...and it filters out people
who believe they're psychics, who aren't.
On more than one occasion,
the law enforcement thought me...
We might have been part
of the actual perpetration of the crime...
...because we convey
such specific details...
...with regard to the location
and the actual method of death...
...and the mechanism
by which the person was killed.
You knew that this murder
was gonna happen?
I didn't know. Her husband knew.
I just passed the warning along
to Rosemary.
Okay, got it. By her own admission...
...she's either a channel for the energy
of the departed souls...
...or she's involved in this murder.
You got a choice.
You can call Ghost Busters...
...or we can take this lady downtown.
Well, if the psychic calls up
and they've got detailed information...
...that we have not given to anyone else,
including family members...
...there's only two things here.
Either, one, he's a good psychic...
...and he really does do this legitimately
and has information...
...that could be of value
and give us good leads...
...or he's involved in the crime.
We had to actually provide alibis
when they came to us.
You know, there's always the possibility
it leaked out somewhere.
But you've also gotta consider
that they may be a credible source.
They absolutely are very intense
about that...
...because in their heart of hearts,
their soul of souls...
...they know the information
that they have is of value.
And so I'm not a disbeliever
in the use of psychics...
...or in the fact that there's people
out there that maybe do see things...
...and get information that is helpful
for law enforcement.
There was another case
where a young man had gone missing...
...and he actually had
some mental illness.
As I tried to connect
with this missing young man...
...I started feeling confused.
And things felt random,
they felt out of place.
And to me, it almost seemed
like the information they had...
...was kind of a burden on them.
They felt like they had to come forward
and give this information.
This had a happy ending, this case.
Because once I gave them the location
of where I believed this person was...
...this kid I had a link with, the police
picked him up and there he was.
As far as psychics getting more involved
in law enforcement work...
...the more acceptance of it.
I think depending on the...
How progressive a department is.
I have a friend that...
Who was a law enforcement officer...
...with a local police department
and he became an FBI agent...
...and he swears he had a case that
the psychic came in, was dead to rights.
He told them where the person was,
who did it, the whole thing.
And it turned out they were right.
So, you know, it happens.
I'm not a disbeliever.
We had a little time with a guy
from the FBI. I did ask him, I said:
"Have you ever worked with psychics?"
The first thing that Mark said was, "Yeah.
They always say the body is near water."
Water rushing into the windows,
tires underwater, resting on concrete.
If the information isn't accurate, if the
information can't be verified as fact...
...you're not providing
psychic information.
Come on.
She simply did what you do so well.
With an air of confidence,
she made an educated guess.
Where else would you dump a car
around here?
She's a good guesser.
Well, yes.
Over the last,
let's say, close to half a century...
...the attitude has become
sort of jaundiced, it's kind of jaded...
...because the media, generally, has
a knee-jerk reaction to the paranormal.
And you're generally negative.
And unfortunately, like so many things
with genuine talents...
...the presence of scamsters
serves to undermine those people...
...who may genuinely have those beliefs.
I'd go out on the limb
and say anyone who sits in this chair...
...and says they're sitting
at a restaurant...
...and spirits come up and talk to them,
you know, I think they're in trouble.
That's really not healthy.
They may be wonderful people
but they're essentially tricksters.
One of the biggest comments made
by people over the course of centuries...
...regarding the paranormal is
if you can see the future...
...if you can sense things
before they occur...
...see through walls
and through people...
...why don't you make millions of dollars
in the stock market or go to Vegas?
It's like if you had superhero powers,
would you really fight crime...
...or would you use them
for your own personal things, you know?
This ability doesn't work like a machine.
And for everyone, it works differently.
It's not a conscious process.
For the most part, it's not that voluntary
and it does what it wants to do.
Which doesn't relate to physical things.
Whatever this functioning is,
however it's designed...
...it is a function
that is meant to serve others.
It is not meant to serve yourself.
It's far more complex
than we ever thought it was.
I certainly want to believe
in the idea of paranormal abilities...
...and, you know, people who have
paranormal beliefs or talents.
My mum actually
has a very unnerving talent...
...of dreaming about people close to us
dying and then they die.
So I've always said to her,
"If you ever have a dream about me...
...just don't mention it."
I think that perhaps there are people
who have abilities.
I think that the majority of people
who have signs on their lawns...
...and who are advertising for it
probably don't.
So they either really genuinely believe
what they're doing is real...
...they fool themselves to believing
they're real...
...or they're even more evil
than I believe they are in the first place.
I've never truly seen a psychic
that couldn't state anything...
...more than the obvious.
So I'm a skeptic.
There's also another angle...
...which is people will always believe
what they want to believe.
We did an episode called "Seeing Red"...
...where Jane is confronted with a woman
who purports to be a real psychic...
...and is very, very good at it.
I think you act assured and arrogant.
But inside, you are troubled
with deep guilt and self-Loathing.
A recent trauma in your past perhaps.
And I love the idea that occasionally
something happens...
...where you doubt your own commitment
to that decision.
The episode ends with her giving him an
insight into what happened to his family.
- I talked to your wife.
- Oh, hang on. This is...
That he desperately wants to believe
is true.
Your wife wants me to tell you
that your daughter never woke up.
She didn't know what happened.
She wasn't scared.
Not even for a second.
I think he wants to believe...
...that they didn't suffer,
didn't go through these things.
There's a beautiful moment at the end
where you're inside Jane's head.
Because she has touched
on the one sacred thing in his life...
...and that's his family.
And his competitive nature
towards psychics...
...and his sort of insecurities
and how he felt threatened.
But my narcissism will allow me
to accept something...
...if it has impact or bearing on me
individually.
It's a constant question that comes up
thematically, like, is he or isn't he?
And I think it's really interesting.
And it really makes you think, what is
the nature of the human condition?
I now there's things out there
that's way beyond my understanding.
So I'm willing to keep that 1 percent
open to, you know, other possibilities.
And we say there's the possibility
that there are people with these gifts...
...on the other side, there's the
possibility that there are people...
...who are very good at guesswork.
I don't doubt that maybe
there is someone out there...
...who can do those sort of things.
But what the end of the show
demonstrates...
...is that which we most devoutly wish
to be real becomes real.
