One, two, three!
My name is Jordan Belfort.
Not him, me.
That's right.
I'm a former member of the middle
class raised by two accountants
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.
The year I turned 26, as the
head of my own brokerage firm,
I make 49 million dollars.
Which really pissed me off because
it was three shy of a million a week.
No, no, my Ferrari was white
like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.
Not red.
See that humongous estate down
there?
That's my house.
My wife, Naomi.
The Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,
a former model and Miller Lite girl.
Yeah, she was the one loop my
cock in the mouth in the Ferrari.
So put your dick back in your pants.
In addition to Naomi and my two perfect kids,
I own a mansion, private jet,
six cars, three horses, two
vacation homes and a 170 foot yacht.
I also gamble like a degenerate, I drink like a
fish, I fuck hookers maybe five-six times a week.
I have three different Federal
agencies looking to indict me.
- Yeah, baby..
- Oh, yeah.
And I love drugs.
Okay..
- Oh, yeah..
- One more.
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.
Later that night..
Pull up! Pull up! We're gonna
crash! For christ sake!
Come on!
Just relax!
Oh.. Fuck..
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm alright.
- Alright, good.
- Good job.
Good..
You got in there save, alright?
- Until next time, brother.
- Until next time.
Yup, on a daily basis I consume
enough drugs to sedate Manhattan.
Long Island, and Queens.
For a month.
Oke, Mr. Jordan.
I take Quaaludes, 10-15 times a day,
for my back pain.
I had the role to stay focus.
Xanax to take the eye pot ot mellow me out,
Cocaine to wake me back up again,
and morphine, well..
Because it's awesome.
Good morning, Lycon.
But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven,
there's one that's my absolute favorite.
See? Enough of this
shit'll make you invincible.
Able to conquer the world.
And eviscerate you enemies.
And I'm not talking about this.
I'm talking about this.
The money doesn'tjust buy you a better life.
Better food, better car, better person.
It's also makes you a better person.
You can give generously to the
church or the political party
of your choice. You can save
the fucking spotted owl with money.
I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.
I'm 22 years old, newly married,
and already a money crisis little shit.
So what do I do?
I go to the one place on earth
that befit my high-minded ambitions..
You are lower than fucking pond scum.
You got problem with that?
Jordan?
- No, no problem at all.
- Good!
Because that's it what you are.
Pond scum.
You job is ''Connector'', which means
that you'll be dialing the
phone over 500 times a day.
Trying to connect me with
wealthy business owners.
And until you pass your Series 7,
that's all you gonna be fucking doing.
Sit. Sit!
Just so you know, last year
I made over $ 300.000.
The other guy you'll be
working for, he made over a million.
A million dollars? I can only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.
- Jordan Belfort? Mark Hanna.
- Yeah, sir.
- Pleasure to meet you.

Your only responsibility is
to put meat on the table.
You got a girlfriend?
I'm new married, I have a wife,

Think about Theresa.
Named a game, move the money from your
clients pocket.
into your pocket.
Right. But if you can make the clients
money, at the same time, isn't that
advantageous everyone, correct?
No, okay, number one rule of wall street.
Nobody.. Okay, if you Warren Buffet or Jimmy
Buffet, nobody knows.
If a stock's going up, down
orsideways fucking in circle,
At least of all stock brokers, right?
It's all in ''Furgazy''.
you know what Furgazy is?
Yeah, ''Furgazy''..
It's a fake..
Yeah, Furgazy, it's
fegazy, it's a wuzzy, it's..
Fairy dust, it doesn't exist.
It's never landed, that is no matter,
it's not on the elemental charge.
It's not fucking real! Alright?
Alright.
Stay with me.
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.
- No.
- So, if you got a client.
who brought a stock at 8,
and now it's at 16.
He is all fucking happy, he is
want to cash it, and liquidate.
Take his fucking money and run home.
You don't let them do that.
- Okay.
- Because that would make it real.
- Right.
- Now, what do you do?
You got another brainer idea.
The special idea.
Another situation, another stock,
to reinvested his earning in this stock.
And he will, every single time.
As they're fucking addicted.
And you just keep doing this,
again, and again, and again.
Meanwhile, he think,
he is getting shit rich.
Which he's is, on papper.
But you and me, the brokers?
We taking the whole hot cash.
The via commision, motherfucker!
Right!
That's incredible, sir.
I can't tell you how excited I am.
You should be.
There is two keys, to success,
in broker business.
First of all..
- You gotta stay relax..
- Yeah.
- You jerk off?
- Do I jerk off? Yeah.
Yeah, I jerk off, yeah.
How many time a week?
Like, 3-4 time, maybe..
Gotta pump those numbers out, those
are rookie numbers in this racket.
I, myself, I jerk off, at least twice a day.
- Wow!
- Once in the morning.
Right after I work out,
and then once right after the lunch.
Really?
Well, I want to,
that's not the way I do it.
I do it, because I fucking need to.
Think about you doing with numbers,
all day long.
Desk more point, high frequensy, bang-bang.
Fucking digits kick, kick, kick,
and all very asidick above the shoulders.
Right?
You can't go weeks the people out.
Right? You got to feed the gizz
to keep the blood flowing.
And keep the ryhtme below the belt.
Done.
This is not a tip, this is
a perscription. Trust me.
If you don't, you'll fall out the balance.
Glicth your differasion,
and the tip fuck over.
Or more shit.
I've seen this happen.
In blood.
- No, I don't want blooded, sir.
- No.
- No you don't. Ya.
- I in for a long run, you know?
- Implusion are ugly.
- Ya.
Pop off to the bathroom,
work on that anytime you can.
And when you get really good at it.
You'll be fucking stroking it,
and you'll be thinking about money.
Second key.
To success.
In this rackets, is this little
baby right here, it's called Cocaine.
Right.
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.
You'll also got your finger dial faster.
And guess what.
That's good for me.
Yes, sir.
- Revolution, you follow?

Well, sometime they do, sometimes they don't.
You know, how it goes.
Well, won't you feel better if you

Of course.
But rich people
didn't buy penny stocks.
They're just don't.

Because they're too smart.
That's why not.

Word about us spread through out Wallstreet.
Even to places I didn't wanted to.
Wasn't long before Forbes Magazine, the flagship
of Wallstreet call to do a profile on me.
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future, for Stratton Oakmont?
We'll work...
- Diversification.
- Sounds good.
Thank you so much, I have more
than enough, I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic!
- Can we get a quick picture?
A total fucking hatchetjob.
This knitting little twad! Look at this!
''The Wolf of Wallstreet,'' they call me. Look!
- Your hair looks good. Yeah.
- My hair looks good.
Jordan Belfort...
sounding like a kind of ''Twisted
Robin Hood,'' who takes from the rich...
and gives to himself and his merry little
band of brokers. Read that, read it.
Listen, there is no such thing
as bad publicity, sweet heart.
- Big article, babe.
- Jordan, you look great.
You're in a huge magazine.
The fucking deal I will.
Mr. Belfort! Just give me a chance!
Mr. Belfort! Excuse me, excuse me, Sir!
Shut the fuck up!
What's all this?
It's the Forbes article, they
all want to work for you now.
Hey! What did I say?
Hey! You want a job, you talk to me!
- Mr. Belfort!
- Forbes make me a superstar.
Everyday, dozens of money craze
kids be the path to my door.
If we hired them, they drop
straight outta college overnight...
and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Stratton taylor.
Are you fucking serious right now?
I mean we were literally putting
clothes on these kids backs,
And here comes thisjerk off snffing around.
But you know, everytime
someone rises up in this world,
there's always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down.
Within months we doubled in size
and move into even bigger offices.
It was a mad house.
A greed fest, with equal parts,
cocaine, testoterone and body fluids.
Yeah!
It got so bad, I had to declare the office a
fuck free zone between the hours of 9 and 7.
But I'm counting even that didn't enough.
Actually the madness started
on our very first day.
When one of our brokers Ben
Jenner, christens the elevator,
by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant.
Her name was Pam and her credit,
she did have this amazing technique,
with this wild, twist and jerk motion.
By the month later, Donnie
and I decided to double team...
on a saturday afternoon while our wives
were out shopping for Christmas dresses..
Eventually Ben marriage,
that which was pretty amazing,
considering she blew every
single guy in the office.
He ain't got the present and
killed himself 3 years later.
Anyway I hired my Dad, Max to
maintain order as The Enforcer.
Stratton very own Gestapo.
We called him ''Mad Max. '' because
of his hair trigger temper.
Which could be set off by something as
obnoxious as a ringing telephone.
Who the fuck has the Goddamn ball to
call this house on a tuesday night?
Goddamn it!
You're gonna missed it!
Oh, please, tell me something I don't know!
I wait all wek for The fucking Equalizer!
And I have to fucking... Hello?
But as soon as he picked up the phone...
Jean? How are you Jean?
He defect his weird British accent.
Why, yeah, Jean, that would be great. Cherio!
It was absolutely bizarre.
Fucking half wit!
- And hang up and then he's Mad Max all over again
- You missed it!
Damn!
What, tell me what happened, what happened?
Well, he discovered it was the Mother's sister.
Who's he? Who?
- Tell me who he is?
- The main guy.
- You know who the main guy,
- The main guy...
it was his Mother sister, she showed up dead.
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know
everything we were doing at Stratton.
Then there's a big target and we...
They get lunge at the target, they stick.
There's a bulls eye and the
bulls eye a dollar sign,
whoever gets close to the dollar
sign gets the most points.
I so full of this shit of
this little fucking thing.
Yeah, you have to hear yourself talk.
So, if he gets hurt, what happens?
Yeah, we're gonna a get fucking knock.
I don't think he's gonna get hurt, they're like...
They got like super human strenght.
I think he's gonna be fine.
You can't look him right in the eyes.
You can't look him at in the eye?
That's a fact, I saw it on PBS.
They get confuse, their they wires get cross.
You gotta look like, the chin Like it's looks like
I'm looking at you, but I'm looking at your chin.
I feel like you addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?
They're like The Monalisa, they find eye
contact, like wherever you standing in the room,
the minute they lock in, you know.
No, but there is a limit to
what we could do with them.
I mean, we're allowed to throw shit at em'.
We allowed to throw food, bananas...
I know crack button.
But, for example, what I wouldn't do
is maybe like tell the police cock out.
and like to get some of the girls
to, you know... Fun or shit like that.
- That would be... That's unacceptable.
- I mean we can, let's keep that in our pocket.
But this guy is more about
thrown, thrown at the dartboard?
Correct, yes, yes.
The thing is this is their gift, okay?
They're built to be thrown like a long dart.
They're top heavy like a long
dart, so they're built for accuracy.
Oh, My God, this is...
Can we bowl with this guy?
That's his fucking brother, Robbie.
He brothers the bowling ball.
The brother you put a skateboard on,
strapped him onto a skateboard.
you toss him down on alley at some pins.
No shit, that's intersesting.
- Can we get that guy?
- We can get, we'll get that guy too.
But it says here, this guy will show his cock.
Yeah, instead of going up, yeah.
They are very armory, by the way, so you
gotta be very careful with these little guys.
Safety first, safety is first, alright?
I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer
gun, ready to knock this fucker out.
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace tasers gun.
A pellet gun manybe? Just like the...
No, pellet gun, is gonna hurt him,
I just want him out, knocked out cold
I say we stick with the loophole, right, okay?
We don't considered him a human,
we just considered it an act.
I think we're in the clear, like a flying,
you know a lot of those guys died.
but they never sued anybody.
The important thing, you
guys gotta keep in mind is...
is that these things gossip,
they get together and they gossip.
- It's a good point.
- And the last thing that we need is...
them getting together and then saying ''Oh,
listen, they made fun of us'' like...
- like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.
- That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.
That is a come in?
We treat itjust like one of us, okay?
One of us, we're gonna treat them like one of us!
We accept that one of us, we're
gonna treat them like one of us!
We accept that one of us, we're
gonna treat them like one of us!
Jordan!
Your Dad's coming, something
about The American Express bill?
- Hey, can you get him outta here? I'm not...
- Yeah, lick my toe.
No, I'm serious, get...
Fuck! Okay, guys, act like we're working on stuff.
Okay, he's coming, he's coming.
Make some shit off.

Four hundred and fucking thirty thousand
fucking dollars in one fucking month!
Good morning, they're businness expenses, relax!
Business expenses? Jordy, look what you got here!
- What?
- Look at this,
$26.000 dollars for one fucking dinner!
Okay, no, no, no this could be explained.
Dad, we had client, we have the Visa client.
Right, the porter house from Argentina.
The expensive champagne and
wine, we have to buy champagne...
And you go it all the fucking sides.
Tel him about the sides order.
- I ordered the sides, so...
- Sides?
Sides? $26.000 dollars, worth the sides?
What are this sides? That cures cancer?
This sides did cure cancer, that's the
problem, that's why they were expensive.
- Shut the fuck up!
- I'm serious...
- I know...
- Stop!
EJ Entertainment, what the
fuck is EJ Entertainment?
Well, that's a...
- Jordan what's EJ entertainment?
- How I describe this...
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.
- That's what it is!
- That's... That is what it is.
That's the perfect decription for it!
It is what it is, but none
of this were charge to me,
This is all of them.
Oh, that was all of us.
It wasn't me though, fucking
explain the shit to him!
These all of your fucking charges right here!
You guys, The IRS, they
allow for T&A, it's fine.
- T&A, T&A?
- Yeah, I said T&E.
- No, no you said T&A.
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah you did, you say T&A!
- When did I say that?
It's T&E, alright?
I know you're upset about the dinner and that
make sense because we did spend too much money.
But I said T&E...
Don't tell me what you
said, I heard what you said.
- I...
- Dad, he said T&A.
- Yeah, he said T&A.
- Yeah, absolutely no question. I heard it.
Jordan, I'm trying too...
- I'm fucking sweating.
- I'm getting this close.
- Dad, relax!
- I'm getting this close!
That's what I'm saying, why you open up more, Max?
He's gonna fucking kill you.
Why do you hold it in? Max, why do you hold it in?
That's it, that's it! Get the fuck out!
- No, no, no, no!
- Hold on!
Get out asshole!
- What kind of hooker takes credit card?
- A rich one!
At Stratton, there were 3 kinds of hookers,
the blue chips, top of the line, model material.
They cost between $300-$500 and you had to
wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip.
Which of course I always did.
Then came the Nasdaq, who are pretty not great.
They cost between $200 and $300 bucks.
Finally there were the pink sheets skanks.
They cost about $100 or less.
And if you didn't wear a condom, you have
to get a pennicilin shot the next day...
and pray your dick didn't fall off.
Not that we didn't fuck them too.
Believe me, we did.
Aw! I slip this thing again.
I know what it is, you know too much...
with EJ Entertainment.
- Pops...
- How are things at home?
Well, not the best, she just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?
It's like this smell, a smell, there's attraction
thing and after a while itjust kinda fades away.
- Yeah, well it supposed to fade away.
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage, you know...
- That so...
- Your Mother and I we've been
married a long long time. - I know
What do you think? We, we, we...
jumpin' into bed every 2 minutes?
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death, I want to stay married, but
It's crazy out there, some of these
girls. You should see them, oh my God.
They're fucking... The things they doing
now, Pops, I mean it's on a whole new level.
- Really?
- And they're all shaved too.
Get outta here!
- All shaved and nice.
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, bald as a China doll.
- No bush? No bush?
- No bush, I know...
- Oh, My God.
All of the sudden like, one week...
- Nobody had anything down there anymore.
- It's a new world.
- They bald from the eyebrows down.
- Wow.
- Nothing, not a stitches, like lasers.
- Wow. New world.
I was born too... Too early.
I've never been a fan of the bush to be honest.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I don't mind it.
Dad, I don't want you
stressin' out about any of this.
How can I not get stressed out? Look at
the knuckle heads you got working for you.
I know they're knuckle head, but I need
them to want to live like me, you get it?
To live like me.
Jordy, one of these days, the
chickens are gonna come home to roost.
You looking at me like I'm crazy.
Crazy? This is obscene.
It was obscene, in the normal world.
I mean who the fuck wanted to live there?
The party are fucking cast off!
We got planes up here, that's gonna take
this company into the fucking stratosphere!
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!
Fuck Lynch, fuck them!
Why should they be taking all of our
fucking money all the fucking time?
That's why we became underrun.
It was our next big move, finding
companies to take public, IPO's.
It was the only way this Wallstreet pricks...
would ever stop thinking of us
as some shit kick a bucket shot.
We got an unclip international.
See we're a little different, we like to get as
fucked up as possible during our businness powers.
in order to stimulate our free flowing ideas.
Which is why we're popping
this ludes like they were M&M's.
You mad...
We own the fucking company...
We own the company...
Don't know what a ludes is?
I'll tell you.
Wait, wait, wait...
Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie, right now.
The Quaalude or lude as it commonly referred to,
was first synthetize in 1951 by an
Indian doctor, that's not feathers.
as a sedative and was prescribed to
stressed out house wife with sleep disorders.
But pretty soon, someone figured out that if you
resist the urges to sleep forjust 15 minutes...
you got a prety kick ass high from it.
Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes of course.
And in 1982 The U.S Government scheduled
one of them along with the rest of the world.
Which meant there's only a
finite amount of this things left.
No shit, you can't even buy them
anymore, you people all shit out of luck.
- Steve Madden...
- Steve Madden.
- Steve...
- Steve.
You remember those ads?
Those giant headed girls with the bug eyes,

and all of Wallstreet was begging
to take his company public.

You guys hungry? Want some to eat? We got some
pasta, shrimp, lobster. I got whiskey and kind

You know what, the biro doesn't allow us
to drink while at sea.
Duh, I forgot, of course.
Ever been on one of these before?
A boat?
Learned to sail when I was six
No shit? Is that right? All right.
I mean, one like this.
The whole front extended so it fit
the chopter up there.
You see that?
Any way, this is for you.
It's uh, a complete list of every person
who was at my wedding..
Yeah, I understand you want the whole wedding
video, figured this would help the whole process,
right?
- There you go.
- Look..
My point is that I know you're investigating
Stratton..
But for the life of me,
I can't figure it out why
I know we are little unorthodox, we are little
loud in the way we do things, we gotta understand
with the new guys on the block..
You know, trying to make an impression, but..
Now I want you to understand, we don't..
do anything Illegal, whatsoever.
You could talk to the SEC, there were at my
office 15 times for the last 6 month..
I mean I got nothing to hide.
Well, you know the SEC is civil right regulatory
agency, we pursue criminal activity.
Exactly, you go after real criminals..
Makes me wonder what.. what the hell are you
doing sticking me for?
What is the thing that we did? or do?
I don't get it.
Well, I.. Jordan I can't discuss
ongoing investigations.
No, I get that, No I understand.
With that said, this case got dumped on
my desk.
- Did it?
- You know, by higher up who..
needs to make a show looking in and the
new company on the block..
- Loud guy..
- I got pressing and anything..
And then I ended up be in the
smuch who does the local, exactly.
Itjust, you know, bothers me..
We are the new guy..
Where the one with bank there
in Wallstreet?
Oh man, you should see what's going on the
bigger firms, I mean I know all the information.
It's true, Goldman, Lehmann Brothers, Merryl,
collateralized debt obligation..
Internet stock bullshit? I mean, it's a fucking
travesty.
I mean I can take you step by step, to what
exactly is occuring, you know..
All you have to do is ask.
It's exactly what I want to hear.
- Hmm.
- I don't see why a little sitdown like this, can
be profitable for the both.
- It should, right, it should profitable.
- It should.
Look, I am gonna give my personal line, 5
days a week, you just call me, feel free.
- I'll do that.
- Great.
Are you sure you guys don't want some to
drink? I mean, you're not hungry? Nothing?
- Nothing?
- Oh no.
No.
Mind if I ask you, and if you dont want to get
too personal, just tell me to shut up at anytime.
Did you try to get your broker's license
at one time?
Isn't that right? When you trying to take
a step at wallstreet?
- No?
- Who have been told it to you?
- Who the fuck you've been talking to?
- Why you investigating me..
Hei, you see what I mean?
You ever think about what would happen
if you're, you know, stay in the course.
You know what? When I ridin' home on the subway,
and my balls are fucking sweating, I'm wearing the
same suit 3 days in a row,
Yeah, you bet I do, I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't rite?
Yeah, who fucking wouldn't?
I mean, what do you.. another personal question,
no need to answer if you don't like..
No, that's all right, Jordan.
Whattaya pull in? 50? 60'k?
something like that?
A year? Low part?
Let's put it this way.
You get a free hand gun when you
sign up for the biro.
No, but it is fucking pisses me off, you know.
When you think about the people that build
this country, hardworking people like you..
You know, fire fighters, teachers,
FBI agent..
End of the day you guys get fucking skin-the-life
financially, fucking makes me angry.
That's the one thing about Wall street, in this
market is, for me..
I feel it's good to give back, you know,
There's situation where I can..
make those situations better for people.
You know what I mean.
Opportunity is everything.
Exactly.
Take for example I got this one
kid, right?
He went to school for environmental
science something like that..
He was bogged down by students loan,
turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery
- Right, horrible situation.
- Sure.
We got them minute, the market, the right time,
choose the right stock, we gave him the right
guidance..
Bom, overnight, change his entire life..
You know, He gotta put his mother into
the best hospital in New York City.
It didn't work out for her, she passed
away unfortunately, but..
We gave him that opportunity,
you know what I am saying?
Itjust about sending up the right team and
then overnight your life can change.
What if.. what is.. what is the intern to make
a deal like that?
Oh that's the situation.
I mean, that particular trade,
and one trade.
North of half a million dollar.
And I do that for anybody, you know, anybody
that needs the proper guidance.
Can you say that again? Just the
way you said it.
Just the same way.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No..
- Oh come on, you know what I am talking about.
- No, I don't know..
Say this, I think Jordan just did..
- If I am not mistake
- No.
- You just tried to bribe a federal agent.
- Oh, technically I didn't.
I didn't bribe anybody, technically, I didn't.
No, according to US criminal code, there needs to
be exact dollar to give for the exchange services.
that would not hold up on the court of law..
No, no, no, that's the truth, but..
- I want to tell you this.
- Yeah.
The same gentlemen that told me that you try to
get your brokers license also told me that you're
straight arrow.
- You ran a security check on me?
- Well..
Sail on the boat, fit for Bond villain,
sometimes you need to play the part, right?
I think it's time you both get the fuck
off my boat, what do you say?
You know Jordan, I'll tell you something.
- Most of the wallstreetjackasses that I bust..
- Yeah.
They're.. they were the man for born.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
Their father is douchebag, just like the
fathers before them
But you..
- You got this all way on your own.
- Did I?
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?
- Good for you.
- Me, the little man?
Let me tell you something.
No, let me tell you something else.
Honestly, I am not bullshit here, this is one of
the nicest boat I've ever been on,
- I got tell you this.
- I bet it is.
And you know what I just thinking too?
what a fucking hero that I am gonna

When the bureau seizes this fucking boat,
because I am being fucked this, fuck, fuck..
It's beautiful, and you got the beautiful
girls there.
- It's wonderful.
- Okay, get the fuck off my boat.
I am sure we'll be seeing each other
real soon.
I am sure, good luck on that subway ride home,
and your miserable ugly fucking wife
I am gonna have Heidi lick some caviar off
my balls in the mean time..
Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters

Nice to meet you.
You understand what we're talking?
Oh, ok.
- Couch, for desk.
- I don't understand, I am sorry.
I am curious about your
bank secrecy laws here.
Wait, yes, excuse me Jordan.
- Swiss custom, we require 10 minutes of bla bla.
- Chit chat.
Chit chat thank you, before business
can be discussed.
Yeah.
Of course, let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?
Under what circumstances would you be obligated
to cooperate with the FBI or..
US justice department investigations,
for example?
Ca depend.
- Ca depend?
- Yeah.
Ca depend on what exactly?
Whether America plans to invade
Switzerland in upcoming month.
- So you want check the tank are rolling down
the Ru de La Croix? - Yes, Ru de La Croix
- Ah, Croix!
- Yeah, Croix
Not Croix, not even Ru de La Croix, Croix
This is what we used to do back in law school,
Champagne - Champagna.
- Yeah.
- yeah yeah, french fries or Frittes.
And kind uh..
- That kind of stuff.
- That's right.
What I'm asking you, Swiss dick,
is are you going to fuck me over?
I understand perfectly,
you American shit.
The only way the Banque Real de
Geneve would cooperate with a
foreign legal body
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.
But there are very few Swiss laws
which applied to your ''practises''
from a financial standpoint.
You are now in heaven.
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?
If the US Justice Department
sent us as subpoena,
it will become a,
um.. papier-toillette.
- We will wipe our ass with it.
-
Unless, of course, it was an
investigation into stock fraud
which is a crime here in
Switzerland, if I'm correct.
Then there would have to be co-operation,
on your part, if I'm not mistaken.
Yes. Yes, we would
Assuming the account is under your name.
If it were another name
- of friends, I get my..
- Cousin.
Cousin, absolutely no.
- Relative.
- Yeah.
Was that yodeling I just heard or..
Did you just say what
I thought he said?
Yes. Yes.
He's telling me to use a fucking
rathole.
But the US rathole would never get
into Switzerland with all that money.
What I needed was a rathole with a
European passport.
- Jordan.
- Hey.
- How's my favourite aunt?
- Welcome, was the traffic terrible?
Oh, no, not at all.
Jordan, Come on in
Thank God, aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.
Turned out the British weren't
too different from the Swiss.
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.
How do you say ''rathole'' in British?
.. If you gettin' any trouble whatsoever,
I'll come for it immediately,
I'll say that I duped you.
And I promise.
Risk is what keeps us
young, isn't it darling?
Sometimes I wonder,
if you let money get
the best of you, my love,
among other substances.
Ooh..
Is that obvious, huh?
It's chilly darling,
you're sweating bullets.
What can I say, I'm um..
I'm a drug addict.
I'm not really am, I, I mean..
Coccain, pills,
whatever it is, I'll fuckin' do it.
That's the truth.
I am.. I am sex addict too.
Well there are worse things to be
addicted to than sex.
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?
I am sorry.
Because I'm very easy to talk to
You are. You are easy to talk to.
That's about it, it's..
It'sjust my job, you know, it's uh..
All these people depending on me, tens of
millions of dollars at stake, you know, it's..
Sometimes I feel like I've bitten
off more than I can chew, you know?
You're a man with large appetites.
yeah.
Is she fuckin' hittin' on me?
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
Suppose I put that on myself though, right?
My decision.
It is hard, though..
Hard to learn to control the
anxiety, sometimes, you know?
You know, to..
Learn to relax, and let go, and..
To release the tension.
She is hittin' on me.
Holy shit.
I got to release the tension.
Suppose we, uh.. We
all just need to learn.
Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?
Is he fucking hitting on me?
Stability, dear. Family.
You take care of my nice, my love.
I'll take care of everything over here.
Deal.
Hold on! There you go!
We had, literally, a fuck load of money.
Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.
So I thought to myself, who
else has European passport?
Okay Brad, you're making
this too fuckin' tight.
Now, Brad, as a successful drug dealer,
spent his winters in the south of France,
which is where he met his wife, Chantelle.
A striper of Slovenian origin,
born in, of all places, Switzerland.
Well, this is fucked.
Oh, no, shit!
- Like this will take a, like, 50 trips.
- I know.
Yeah, a suicide work.
But, how about her family? Right?
I mean, they all got
Swiss's passport, right?
I mean, she's got parents,
she's got a brother.
Right, brother's got a wife,
that's five fuckin' people.
Six, seven trips, boom, right?
They're all fuckin' Swiss and it was like,
''what are you doing?'', they could do that.
At least I have a family,
you crooked nose fuck!
Hey, hey, uh, don't
forget about my money.
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Hey, I forgot to tell you
- he's got some, he's got some money.
- My money.
- Yeah, a couple mill comin' in like a week.
- Yeah.
And when it gets here, I'll give
you a call, you come pick it up.
You give me a call?
When it gets here, I'll give you
a call, and you come pick it up.
Well, we don't fuckin'
work for you, man!
Shh..
Sweetheart, you have my
money taped to your tits.
Okay? Technically you do work for me.
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.
If I fuckin' do this, I'm telling
you right now, I ain't goin' to him.
Okay? I'm not a fuckin' schwas, I
don't do fuckin' pick-ups, alright?
- But listen to me, when this thing placed,
- I'm gonna take care of everything.
and I fuckin' say, and you
tell that fuckin' piece of shit.
- If he comes correct.
- I will.
If he comes in, I'll fuckin' loopy and fucked up.
I swear to God, I'm a mash that douchebag's teeth.
I hear that, who's fucking cheating?
- Who's fuckin' cheating?!
- Look, may I asking..
I put the money on that
fuckin' table, not you!
I'm the reason we
have this fuckin' deal!
- I have a gun, you fucking idiot!
- What the fuck this gun.
I already told you this.
You know what? You're a fuckin' pill
deal, I got five more just like you, bro!
Keep talking, you piece of shit!
Do you know what? You dress like shit!
- So, fuck you!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Jesus!
- Like that faggot. Who's the faggot?
- Enough with your shit!
- You okay?
Hey pal!
The next day, aunt Emma flew to Geneve.
Two million in cash in her carry on.
Which in a big picture was
a drop in the Swiss bucket.
'Cause the following month,
over the course of six roundtrips,
Chantelle's family and friends smugglin'
over 20 millon in cash without even a hiccup.
- Shred it.
- And by the way..
- Here they are.
- Excellent!
- And I have some more.
- Really?
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.
- And here.
- Welcome.
Welcome?
- And yeah, like four bags of it.
- Ooh.
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?
- Slovenian. Yes.
- Slovenian? Okay.
- So you're blonde?
- Oh, stop that.
Shit.
Put the fuckin' car
parked, you dumb idiot!
Yeah, close the briefcase.
One fuckin' day, one fuckin' day
you couldn't keep it together?
I was fucked up, Brad.
- You're fuckin' kidding me!
- Fucked up.
- It's a joke!
- It's a joke?
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- It's a fuckin' joke. I'm not stupid.
- Are you fuckin' stupid?
- You fuckin' drivin' you like a fuckin' maniac.
- Do you know what..
- You know the attention that fuckin' draws?
- You know what, I'm not stupid.
- I'm smart.
- Smart?
- I make million dollar deal.
- That's right.
We smart important people, unlike you.
People who don't sucker punch
people when they're scared, okay?
- I'm scared?
- And by the way,
- I haven't got an apology for that.
- One apology, okay.
I check my fuckin' messages everyday
- when I come home from work
- Did you?
- my answering machine
- You didn't got one, huh?
zero! I got a blinking light
because I don't have shit from you!
- Yeah right. You know, you got a big
fuckin' mouth! - I got my wife, I got my wife
checking the messages every 45
minutes, calling the office say,
has Brad apologize? Is there any
apology message on the machine?
- Alright, do you know what..
- I don't have jack shit.
- You know what? That's not how you treat me.
- Yeah, you got a big fuckin' mouth. You know
I'm not gonna give you a fuckin'
pass, just give me the case.
- Oh, you're not gonna give me a pass?
- Get out of here.
Look, it's a figure fuckin' speech.
- Oh my God, the Emperor of Foxville
- Just give me the fuckin' case

to give me a pass!
Hey, what are the citizens of Foxville
doing at the day when the Emperor's gone?

Or people looting and raping?
What all the little fuckhead doing?

Do I have a surprise for you.
Retired pharmacist friend of mine,
it been in his safe for 15 years.
You fuckin' kiddin' me? Lemons?
-
- They're gonna knock us out off our fuckin' head.
When it comes to quaalude, the
lemon 714 was the holygrail.
- Can you believe it?
- Oh my God..
I thought they were like a myth.
Three times as powerful as
anything available today.
- Look at these babies.
- Boy Donnie really knew how to celebrate.
He said he was saving these for a special
occasion, like a birthday, or being clapfree.
Or, my money arriving
safely in Switzerland.
We're gonna die!
So that night, I cleared my schedule,
and I rid my body of anything
that could fuck with my high.
It was celebration time.
Okay.
We start off with one, see how it'll go?
My guy says all we need is one.
Here we go.
- Salute.
- Cheers.
Maybe if I pull it
again, it will go down.
Steve,Steve! I gotta get outta here.
No! I think I got it figured out.
It must be one pull for
up, and two pull for down.
Okay.
You feel anything?
No.
Been thirty five minutes.
Maybe we built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?
Hm..
This is bullshit!
My metabolism is pumped
out, I can't feel shit!
They're old, I think
they lost the potency?
Huh?
Check the bottle!
January '81
They're fuckin' duds.

Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

Hey! Bo, what's going on?
Jordan, listen to me clearly.
I can not talk to you in this

We're gonna get outta

Listen to me, leave the

And then call me from a payphone.
This is not a fuckin' joke, Jordan.
Yeah, yeah. Ya.
- Shit!
- What's.. What he said?
I don't know what the fuck
is going on, I gotta go!
Is everything okay, Jordan?
The closest payphone I can get to
is at the Brookvile Contry Club.
It was a real WASP stronghold.
Just a mile down the road from my house.
Hey Bo, what's up? It's me, what's going
on? I'm at the payphone, what's going on?
Listen to me carefully.
Please, your little friend
here, Brad, your little buddy,
he's in jail.
He.. What the fuck he's in
jail for? What did he do?
I don't know what he did.
My friend in Long Island told me he got
picked up in some fuckin' shopping mall,
- he got locked up..
- Wait, did you say a shopping mall?
- Yeah, yeah.
- He, he was with Donnie
he was supposed to deliver some money,
and that fuckin' fat piece of shit.
- I'm gonna go and fuckin' kill him.
- Jordan, Jordan, Jordan. Listen to me!
Don't go! Listen to me.
That guy, Denham, that FBI agent guy,

tapped. Your ofice and your home.
- Don't talk on that motherfuckin' phone!
- Okay. Fuck! I got it, I got it.
I got it, I got it.
Jordan.
You didn't try to bribe this
fuckin' FBI agent, did you?
No, I didn't try to
bribe that FBI agent.
You think I'm that fuckin'stupid? No!
What the fuck you said?
I can't understand.
Say that again!
I said I won't, I know what
my feeling with this FBI agent.
What the fuck are you saying?
- I said..
- Are you fuckin' high?
Are you kidding me? I
don't wanna see more FBI!
Jordan! Are you fuckin' high?
Jordan, do me a favour.
Stay where you are,
don't get behind the wheel of the car,
I'll be there in a
moment to pick you up.
Jordan, Jordan!
After 15 years in storage,
the lemons had developed a delayed fuse.
It took 90 minutes for this little
fuckers to kick in, but once they did..
Pow!
I mean, I'd skipped the tingle phase
and went straight to the drool phase.
Tell me where you are, don't fuckin'..
This little bastard was so strong,
I discovered a whole new phase.
The cerebral palsy phase.
Come on, stand up.
Oke, walking's out.
I think, think what else is there?
Yes!
I can crawl, I can crawl like Skylar.
Fuck!
The kid makes it look so goddamn easy.
Think, you motherfucker, think.
Yes!

Oh Jesus. Where are you?
I'm at the Country Club.

Donnie is out of control.
He's on the other line
with some Swiss guy,
- I don't know..
- What?!
Get him off the phone!
I can't understand you.
Get him off the phone!
What the fuck are you saying, Jordan?
Can you just get home? Hurry.
Oh my God!
Oh my God..
I was less than a mile from home.
I drove as slow as I fuckin' could.
I think Jello move faster.
I just couldn't give him two million.
I'm gonna be a little late.
You ate two million?
Million!
Get off the phone, get off
the fuckin' phone, idiot!
-
- Get out of the way, asshole!
- Hello?
- Too late..
- And it's..
- You hate two million?
No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.
By some miracle, I made it home alive.
Not a scratch on me or the car.
Is that so?
Jordan?
Oh Jesus fucking Christ!
What did you take?
What is wrong with you?
Jordan!
It's fuckin' good, right?
- What the fuck are you saying?

Oh, fuck! I don't know what to do!
Jordan, I don't know what the

What are we gonna do, Jordan?
Oh my God, I think he's choked, Jordan.
Do something!

He's not breathing, Jordan.
You got to do something!

Step aside! Oh my God!
Oh God!
Move aside, baby!
Oh, God..
Look at me! Come on!
Come on, come on!
Jordan, he's not breathing,

Jordan, he's a father, he's
got fucking kids, do something!
Yeah! Yeah.
Jordan, you gotta get over
here, tell me what I'm doing.
Oh fucking God, get over here, call 911!
You alright?
Are you alright?
Mr. Belfort?
Mr. Belfort?
Why the fuck you are here? Fuck.
Sir?
We need to ask you some questions.
You fuckin' kidding me? Fuck you!
Come on, get up!
Well, get the fuck outta my house!
- Let's go! Come on! Get up!
- I've been here all night.
- Let's go!
- I've been sitting here all night.
- What the fuck are you talkin'?
- Wait a minute, why you taking him?
- The fuck are you doing?
- Let's go!
Why you taking him?
- Tell him!
- We got no warn.
You just come up and
peep a house like this!
- I'm just talkin'..
- Did you drive your car that night
Mr. Belfort?
Well.
Wow!
Maybe I hadn't made at home okay.
Get out of the fuckin' way!
Fuck! Fucker!
Did you drive..
That car, tonight?
- Yeah..
- Yeah?
Right.
I'm a family man. Family man. Honey!
It was a miracle I wasn't killed.
More, you know, that I
didn't kill anybody else.
The cops took me in for questioning,
but they couldn't charge ne.
They had no proof I was even behind the wheel.
Meanwhile, Brad did three months in jail for
contempt because he wouldn't let Donnie out.
The result? I was scot free.
But I had eyes on me like never before.
You're a lucky man, Jordan.
You're lucky be alive,
let alone not in jail.
No, I don't believe in luck, right?
But it's time.
Please, let me call
the SEC and cut a deal,
before your luck runs out.
Wave to daddy!
Hey! Hey, sweetie.
-
- You're doing great, sweetie.
You're doing so great.
What kind of terms that
we do talking about, if I..
- You know..
- I don't know
you know you plead guilty to
handful of securities violation.
Stock manipulation, high pressure sales
tactics, ticky-tack shit like that, you know?
Pay a couple million dollars in fine,
in exchange, SEC fucks
off till the end of time.
And Stratton, what happen to Stratton?
I mean that you,
there's no way, I mean..
You gotta walk away, right?
- Let Donnie be in charge.
- Alright, Donnie.
And the FBI is another
animal, completely.
They still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.
However, with you
stepping down voluntarily,
my guess is, that your best friend, agent Denham,
will be standing around with his dick in his hand.
Jordan.
Wh.. What do you have to think about?
Yo.. You beat them!
You won!
God knows you'll never
have to work again.
What you're gonna do? Spend the rest of
your life in jail? Is that what you want?
- No.
- Okay!
Okay. You got all the
money in the world.
You need everybody else's money?
- Of course not.
- Well?
- You know I built it.
- I know you built it!
You built it, so now preserved it!
You know..
Five years ago, when I started
Stratton Oakmont with Donnie Azoff,
I knew the day would eventually
come where I'd have to be moving on.
And it's trully with a heavy
heart, that I'm here to say that..
That, that that day is finally here.
I wanna, I wanna thank you all for your
years of loyalty and admiration, but uh,
the point is this.
Under Donnie's keadership, along with
Nicky Koskoff and Robbie Feinberg,
moving into key management posisitions,
this place really is, it's gonna be better
than ever. That I promise you, okay?
This is Ellis Island, you people.
Okay, who you are, or where you
from, where do your relatives came
over, from the fuckin' Mayflower,
or the inner tube from Haiti.
This, right here, is the land of
opportunity, Stratton Oakmont, is America!
- All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right?
- Yes, we do.
Fuck you!
Come on, Kimmie.
Which you probably didn't know is,
Kimmie was one of the first brokers
here, one of the Stratton's original 20.
And most of you met Kimmie the beautiful
sophisticated woman that she is today.
A woman that wears
Drives brand new Mercedes Benz.
A woman who, who spends her winters
in Bahamas and her summers in Hamptons.
That's not the Kimmie that I met.
The Kimmie that I met didn't
have two nickels to rub together.
She was a single mom on the balls of
her ass with an eight year old son.
Okay? She was three
months behind on her rent.
And when se came to me
and ask me for a job,
she asked for 5000 dollar advance just..
Just so she could pay her son's tuition.
And what I do, Kimmie?
Go on, tell them.
You wrote me a check..
For 25.000 dollars.
That's right.
Thank you.
And you know why that is?
That's because I believed in you.
It's because I believed in you, Kimmie.
Just like I believe in each
and everyone of you here today.
- I fuckin' love you, Jordan. I fuckin' love you.
- I fuckin' love you.
- I love you.
- I fuckin' love you too!
I fuckin' love you too!
And I love all of you!
I love all of you, from
the bottom of my heart.
- I love you, Jordan!
- I mean it!
It's a shame, you know, 'cause..
For years I've been telling you guys,
never to take ''no'' for an answer, right?
In order to keep pushin' and
to never hang up the phone,
until you get what you want.
Because you all deserve it.
You know this fuckin' deal
that I'm about to sign..
barring me from the securities
industry, barring me from Stratton..
My home..
The fuck is that? You know?
I tell you what it is. It's..
It's me taking ''no''
for an answer, you know?
It's them, them selling me,
not the other way around. It's..
It's me being a
hypocrite, is what it is.
So..
You know what?
I'm not leaving.
I'm not leaving.
I'm not fucking leaving!
The show goes on.
This is my home.
They gonna need a fucking wrecking
ball to take me outta here!
They gonna need to send a national
guard or fucking SWAT team,
'cause I ain't going nowhere.
Fuck them!
Jordan! Jordan!
Jordan, get back here!
Hey!
Give.. Give me that!
What a trouble in the jungle, for Christ sake!
How did he, muffle
truffle you, huh, richman?
Turn the offer, trust
Welch on the order of SEC.
He is back in the ocean, happy hunting.
It was our time to party big.
And just as Brad was
released from jail too.
I apologize, even offered to
pay him for his time in the can.
But he said no.
The day he was out,
he didn't want any part of us.
Sad thing was, two years later,
he was dead.
Massive heart attack, at 35.
Same age Mulshock died.
Not that they, have a hell
of a lot in common, but,
anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.
Within days, subpoena started flying.
Notices to produce documents,
deposititions, you name it.
Donnie couldn't drink water fast enough.
You now say it's coming
was to get me a subpoena.
Here's how we do a subpoena
to substracting our funds.
Fuck you USA, Fuck you!
Fuck you, Fuck you..

After all this I finally got the message.
New dream, of becoming financially indepedent.
But struggle every month just to pay your bills.
Would you like to own a home like this?
Who can barely afford to pay your rent.
My name is Jordan Belfort.
And there is no secret to well creation.
No matter who you are. No
matter where you came from.
You too can become finacially
independent in just a matter of months.
All you need is strategy.
When i was 24 years old, i made a decision.
Not to survive, but to thrive.
At first i didn't feel like
deals like this were possible.
But we have the house, and we
have 30 thousand dollar profit.
I certainly beleive now.
I think about it for second.
If you dont have guts to attend Jordan Belfort
Straight line perssuasion system seminar.
Then how do you, expect to make any money.
You wanna be a millionaire some day.
Have some guts make a decision.
Jordan belforth said work for
me because i work hard for it.
And if it doesn't work for you it's because
you lazy, you should get a job at Mcdonalds.
There is nobody holding you
back from financial freedom.
And there is nobody stoping
you from making millions.
Don't you sit in a home or the life
you dreamed will fly right pass.
I change all these people's
live and i can change yours too.
So come to my seminar, the
life of your dream is only..
- You're under arrest

Even more fucked was he got busted for
shit that had nothing to do with me.

There is a term and we dont like to
use it unless circumtances dictate..
.. I think they do dictate in this case and
term is Grenada, have you ever heard Grenada.
No i haven't.
Grenada very interesting because it is a small
island nation that was invaded by the United
States of America 1983 have 9000 people.
And essentially means is.
This case is unloseable.
So, you know, come in we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants, nobody gives a fuck.
I'm gonna win.
You Sir.
Are was known.
As a Grenada.
You're looking at real prison time.
Money laundering can get you as much 20 years.
And, our case gonna be stronger, if we
caught your shed and cash your mattress,.
Oh that right.
Hei Jordan.
Jordan, You're rotting away in
jail, 2 your kids get out the college.
That's not our ambition here.
There's other people involve in this too.
We think, they need to see
their day in courts as well.
Why do I sense there's
an offer in the air?
He's got good sense.
What are you, Craskin?
Full cooperation, he provides us with the
comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning
the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire.
- Did you just say wear a wire?
- A wire.
Wow, wow, is that means, you
want me to rat, is that it?
No, i want you to cooperate.
- No, you want me to rat.
- Yes, we want you to rat.
That fucking exactly what
we want you to do, to rat.
How is Christy's party?
- Fine.
- Good.
Babe, i've spoke to the lawyers again today.
There is some really really great news.
Turns out you completely
off the hook, honey.
I know that already.
Right, exactly, you never did
anything wrong in first place right?
It turns out, all the FBI really
wants for me is to a coorperate.
You know.. turns out i have so much information
about the stock market and the Wallstreet..
That i could save the government years of
heartache not to mention countless dollars.
It gets even better babe.
Because if i do to sign cooperate, i might
only be looking at 4 short years.
How much case, we could start
fresh maybe sell the house.
And any fine that i have to pay
wouldn't due till i serve term.
So, we still have plenty
money left over, you know.
You think, of course bug me out a little
bit is this whole idea for doing it.
Give an information about my friends.
Ohh, like he said, ther is
no friend on Wallstrett right.
Right.
It's exactly silver lining to that
too honey because they said eventually.
Eventually everyone gonna have to
give an information on this case.
So at the end of the day, might
not even a factor, you know.
- Well, that's a good news, right.
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm really happy for you.
What do you mean you happy for me?
- You should be happy for the both of us right?
