No
No
No
No
No
Sip the juice
I got enough
to go around
And the thought
takes place uptown
I grew up
on a sidewalk
Where I learned
street talk
And then taught
to hawk New York
I go to Queens for queens
to get the crew from Brooklyn
Make money in Manhattan
and never been took in
Go uptown to the Bronx
and boogie down
Get strong on the island,
recoup and lay around
Time to build
my juice back up
Props stack up
Suckers get smacked up
Don't doubt
the clout
You know
what I'm about
Knockin' niggers off,
knockin' niggers out
Shakin' 'em up,
wakin' 'em up
Rakin' 'em up,
breakin' 'em up
Standin' on shaky ground,
too close to the edge
Let's see if I know
the ledge
The corner's triflin',
'cause Shorty's here
I get cocked liftin'
Here's a sip for
the crew that's deceased
If I get revenge,
then they rest in peace
Somebody gotta suffer
I just might
spare one
And give a brother
a fair one
Stay alert and on pees
And I do work
with these
Like Hercules
Switch to southpaw,
split your right jaw
'Cause I don't
like y'all
I'm hype
when night fall smooth
But I move
like an army
Bulletproof down
In case brothers
try to bomb me
Puttin' brothers
to rest
Like Eliot Ness
'Cause I don't like stress
Streets ain't a place
for innocent bystanders to stand
Nothin's gonna
stop the plan
I'll chill like Pacino
Kill like De Niro,
black Gambino
Die like a hero
Livin' on shaky ground
Too close to the edge
Let's see
if I know the ledge
Shells lay around
on the battle ground
Dead bodies are found
throughout the town
Try to put shame in my game
to make a name
I'm gonna
put it on a bullet
Put it in your brain
And my pockets
are still fat
Wherever I'm at,
I get the welcome mat
So come say hi
to the bad guy
Don't say goodbye
I don't plan to die
'Cause I get loose
And I got troops
And crazy juice
Quincy, get up!
It's after 7:00,
and you're going to be
late for school again!
Quincy Powell,
did you hear me?
I said get up.
This is bullshit, man.
Excuse me, young man,
what did you say?
Nothin', Ma.
That's what I thought.
Get up.
Enter the dragon 'cause
it's startin'to rain
Rappers
on the bandwagon...
Gerard, Eric,
time to get up!
Come on, man,
move it, man.
Move your fat feet.
You're too fat
to be smelling bad.
You gonna never get
anywhere but... stop!
Don't, you little bitch!
Get your rusty butt up!
I'm up, Pop,
I'm up.
And do something
about this room.
Sure thing.
Fatness never
prospereth.
Morning, Grandma.
Oh, morning, baby.
Breakfast is ready.
See if your father's hungry!
Raheem, you know I got
a job interview this morning.
Let me in.
I'm late as is.
Raheem, let me
in the bathroom!
How much?
How much what?
How much you willing
to give me to get in?
Fuck you, Raheem!
I ain't givin' you shit!
Raheem, let me in.
I'll give you a dollar.
Ha ha!
Quincy, I was talking
to Louise in 4-A.
Her boy Tyrone...
You know Tyrone,
that tall skinny boy?
Nice kid.
He's looking to get
into the Acme School,
that school
where they teach you
to fix cars, washing machines,
and whatnot.
You make good money
doing that.
Are you listening to me?
I'll give you $5.00,
Raheem.
Now, let me in.
Did you say $5.00?
Yes, I did.
Cool. $5.00.
I'm with that.
Have you been
working out?
You look nice.
You look real fine.
I'll give it to you
later.
Myra, you better
give me my $5.00!
What's going on
out here?
Nothin', Ma.
Better creation,
what a celebration
My vocabulary
is varied
Trouble like a trick hand,
sinking like quicksand
Makin'the competition feel
like they need a kickstand
To support
what they thought
Would have brought them
some type of victory
You better
never act, no
G- G-Good ol'doggy.
Nice puppy.
Take it easy, Pop.
Button up your coat.
Don't be comin' back
all hours of the night.
I won't.
And clean up that room,
or it's gonna be
me and you.
You can't play that music
the rest of your life.
What time are you
comin' home?
And you're not going
in the Army either.
Remember that.
Quincy, where's
your books?
What's up, Lenny, man?
Better hurry that ass up.
Mrs. Sanders ain't going
for that late shit no more.
Yo, I need those notes
for biology class.
If I flunk, I'll have to
kick your ass.
I'm sorry.
Damn, baby, what's up?
Can I get that number?
Eric, come back here
and make up your bed!
- Busted!
- Damn!
Yo, Raheem!
Yo, Raheem!
Keesha. Keesha, wait.
I don't want to argue.
I'm tired of that shit.
What the fuck
do you want, then, Raheem?
I got to take the baby
to the sitter.
I could help.
That's my baby, too.
If we got back
together...
I ain't even about
to let you have my baby
so you can have him
hangin' out with you
and your fucked-up friends.
And how would Charlene
feel about that?
I ain't messin'
with Charlene no more.
Raheem, you ain't even
foolin' nobody.
Everybody knows.
It's all over the school.
Come talk to me
when you're serious.
I'm serious now.
I'm serious, too,
Raheem!
This does not
make you a man.
I need a real man.
I'm not lettin' my child
grow up and be fucked up
like you and your
stupid-ass friends.
Yeah, well,
fuck you, then!
I don't need
your tired ass anyway, bitch!
That was real smooth, man.
I'm squashin' her.
That shit is
too much work.
I should've
let you have her.
Just buggin', man.
What's up?
Yeah. I thought so.
So you wanna
be a gangster...
Yo, Bishop!
What you want?
Your ass, punk!
People been sayin'
that you say
you can bust my ass.
You believe that shit?
So?
Chill, chill,
chill, chill, chill.
Smile, man, smile.
See this?
Take a real good look at him,
'cause that's how
a dumb nigger commits suicide.
You think your shit
is that bad, man?
You got that much juice?
God damn right.
Don't nobody
fuck with me.
'Cause you already
fucked up, man.
You can't fuck up somethin'
that's already fucked up.
If you wasn't
as fucked up as you are,
you'd see
that shit, man!
What a dumb nigger, man.
Fuck you, you beans and rice
son of a bitch!
Respect me.
I was almost your father,
but the line
was too fucking long!
Hey, hey,
it's cool, man.
It's cool.
Raheem, man, you better
tell your boy somethin',
'cause I don't care
if he's crazy or not.
I'll stomp the shit
out of his ass.
You ain't saying
nothing but a word!
He's just bullshittin'.
He didn't mean it.
Shit if I didn't mean it.
Fuck that little
Puerto Rican maricon!
Maricon? Maricon?
If you're looking' for faggots,
you ain't got to look no farther
than your pa.
I hear he liked bein'
the prison yard whore!
Fuck you,
motherfucker!
Get away from my store!
I'm gonna shoot
your pee-pee off, man.
Tell me that wasn't
the shit.
You're crazy, man.
Ain't had no fun like that
in a while.
That nigger had you
by your neck and shit.
I swear to God...
What's up, Fat Chops?
What's up, man?
Hey, how you doin'?
You're late, man.
I feel good.
Sorry, man.
I was busy, man.
I had a hard time
gettin' away, man.
Give those chubby palms
a rest,
you'd get here
with the rest of us.
Want to know
why I'm really late?
I was doin'
the hootchy-kootchy
with Donna Bromwell.
So you boned
Donna Bromwell?
Yeah, man.
She liked it, too.
My man,
finally got that ass.
I heard that.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
So how was it?
It was good.
What do you think?
I heard Donna Bromwell
was a real freak.
The bitch tried to fuck me
on the stove.
She still got that,
uh, tattoo?
No, man. I wasn't lookin'
for no tattoo.
I was doin' the hootchy-kootchy,
my friend.
You knew it was Donna
from that hair on her face.
Yeah, man, come on.
You didn't know about
Donna Bromwell, man?
What, man, what?
That she used to be
Donald Bromwell?
Big Don?
Don Juan.
Fuck y'all, man.
Come on, big, hefty,
tub-of-a-man you!
Don't make me
come after you!
Get the fuck off me!
My man.
You big
fat-head jalopy.
'Reckin' crew!
Hope you're feelin'
lucky today, my brother,
'cause I'm getting ready
to bust your ass.
You want me
to lie to you?
Just 'cause you
pour syrup on shit
don't make it pancakes.
Q!
What's up?
What's happenin'?
You got that
party tape for me?
Yeah, I got the shit.
My brother, my brother,
my brother, my brother.
Bad news, though.
Bein' that we in a recession,
the shit's gonna cost
$ 15 instead of 10.
- $ 15.
- $ 15?
Hit the button!
Hit the button!
Pow!
Kiss? Money?
What you gonna do, sweetheart?
I ain't got all day.
Do what you're told.
Give me a kiss.
Was the last party
serious?
It was slammin'?
It was all right.
It was dope, right?
Do you hit
Brenda's skins?
What?
Did Brenda Witherspoon
shine your silver?
My mother shines
our silver.
All you could see
was that butt.
I don't know why you thought
that was so tough.
She got the snappy-nappy
dugout piece.
Snappy-nappy
dugout piece?
Did you fuck
Brenda Witherspoon?
Yeah, I did, man.
Yeah?
You did, right?
$ 15, G.
Lord, I came
at the perfect time.
Pop two quarters in,
pop-tart,
and let's get it on.
Let me get

What makes you think
you can beat me?
Two reasons.
I'm going to beat that ass.
I'm going to beat that ass.

Yo! Hey, you see

I was tellin' you
all about this.
This shit is mine,

We gotta worry about
runnin' into Radames,
and this nigger
talkin' about
some bullshit-ass
deejay contest.
First prize is
custom gold 1200s
and a six-month contract
to deejay at the Ruffhouse.
Better than this pool hall
nickel-and-dime bullshit.
Yo, DJ Plaz,
DJ Rich E. Rich,
Pete Rock, and DJ Scratch
gonna be there.
So what?
They won both contests
last year.
That was the Hott Boxx.
Anybody could have won
in that shit.
This is the Ruffhouse.
The comp will be serious.
There ain't
no greater comp than me.
Y'all ain't got
no confidence in me now?
Y'all supposed to be
my boys.
They been all over.
Everybody know them.
You just local.
Local?
Y'all kiss my local ass,
you know what I'm sayin'?
All right.
Come on, Q.
You're still
my favorite local deejay.
I'm going to pick up
some party tapes
for my audition tape.
That's all right

Yeah, man.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, yeah
When my love

To fulfill

Can I call tonight?
Wait a second.
Sir, where are you going?

Man, I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat.

His mom ain't home.
Taxi! Taxi!
What she got

She still got

No, man.
She ain't been shoppin'.
I believe we need

Hi.
Yo, Q. Go in and get me

Why I got to
go get them?
It's your turn,

How you doing?
It's good to see you, man.
I'm all right.
How's your crew?
They outside waiting.
When you got paroled?
I got paroled
the other day, man.
I hope you're
taking care of yourself.
Of course I'm
taking care of myself.
It's nice to see, man.
Pardon me.
I'm about to rob this place.
Everybody,
put your hands in the air
and face the fuckin' bar!
Oh, shit, man.
Don't look at me!
Yo, Q. You want
a piece of this?
No, man.
I'm all right.
All right, everybody,

Take your fuckin'
clothes off!
Hurry up, god damn it,
'cause you look good!
As fat as you are,
there ain't no food
in the house?
Yeah, she's going
shopping tonight.
No, we're going today.
Ah, thank you.
Yo, Blizzard is in there
right now
stickin' the place up.
Word, right now?
He let you out?
He asked me if I wanted
a piece of the action.
You said no?
What are you, crazy?
I don't think so.
Let me tell you
something.
That crazy motherfucker
is goin' down.
I'm making for
god damn sure
that we're
not goin' with him.
You know how much
money is in there?
We are in there, man.
I said no, man.
That shit is out.
Now, come on.
Come on, man.
Come on, man.
I thought that
was your woman.
Man, what you gonna do?
Steel's kitchen.
Almost empty.
Mmm!
Got to get it right,
buddy.
Oh, it's up now.
Oh, shit.
All right,
there he goes.
Bust 'em!
Bust 'em!
Boo-yeah!
Boo-yeah!
Pow! Boo-yeah!
Aw, shit!
Damn, Steel.
What the fuck is this mess, man?
Bacon and eggs
and hot sauce, man.
I mix it like this
all the time.
I'm too hungry
to throw this shit away.
But I only did it
for you, Ed.
Cody still ain't
gonna like to hear
that she got it
in the back.
Oh, shit!
Shot his moms in the back.
Yo, Steel. Let me borrow
these two till tomorrow.
This shit's dope.
Excuse me, partner,
can you keep that shit down?
You see me watching TV.
Made it, Ma!
Top of the world!
Top of the world!
Yo!
If you gotta go out,
that's how you go out.
That motherfucker took
his destiny in his own hands.
Mmm, some destiny.
What you know about it,
Big Chops?
What you ever control?
I control my life.
That's bullshit.
I got more control
over your life than you do.
How you figure that?
I'm lettin' you breathe,
ain't I?
You can't even
walk your own block
without getting fucked up
by Radames, let's not forget.
Ha ha ha.
Oh, shit!
It's Blizzard!
A gunman was killed
in a shoot-out with police
as he attempted to rob
the Harlemwood bar
identified as 20-year-old
Barnett Jerkins,
wounded two officers before
he himself was killed.
On the news at 7:00,
we'll have more on this story
as well as an update
on the campaign...
Yo, man, we were
just down there.
To have the already
financially strapped city
provide more
police protection
on the subway els
after dark.
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Come here!
Fuckin' Radames.
We ain't shit.
Man, what's your problem?
You're my fuckin' problem!
People sweat us
on the street,
and you don't even
give a fuck.
I think you're
exaggerating.
That's bullshit, man!
We run from the cops,
we run from Radames,
we run from
security guards,
we run from Old Man Quiles
and his bullshit store
when he come
with that bullshit gun.
All we do
is fuckin' run!
I feel like I'm on
the god damn track team.
I'm serious!
What's the matter,
Raheem?
Nothin' to say?
That's 'cause
you know I'm right.
In your heart,
you know I'm right.
Yo, big man! If you want
respect, you gotta earn it.
You damn right!
You gotta be ready
to go down,
stand up,
and die like Blizzard did
if you want some juice.
Blizzard? Blizzard ain't
stickin' up to nothin' now.
That's 'cause we wasn't there
to back him up!
If we was there...
There'd be five dead niggers
instead of one!
You ain't sayin' nothin' now,
right, big man?
I never thought
I'd see the day
when you'd
talk like a punk.
Fuck you, man!
Yo, chill!
Fuck chill!
Check yourself, Q.
You gotta
snatch some collars
and let them
motherfuckers know
you're there
to take them out
anytime you
feel like it.
You gotta get the ground
beneath your feet,
get the wind
behind your back,
and go out in a blaze.
Otherwise
you ain't shit.
You might as well be dead
your damn yourself.
You tryin' to tell me
I ain't shit?
I ain't tryin'
to tell you shit.
I'll tell your mama
you ain't shit.
Yo, man, what
are we fightin' for?
I don't know, nigger.
You ready to die?
You're fucked up, man.
Don't turn your fuckin'
back on me, nigger!
You broke
the fuckin' vase, man!
What the fuck
is y'all doin', man?
Damn, man!
What the fuck?
Messin' up my shit, man!
Feed y'all!
Sorry, man. Here!
Fuck that money, man!
Look at that shit!
I got to tell
my parents...
Shut the fuck up!
All right, that's it!
That's it!
Bishop, I want you and Q
to settle this shit
right now!
Come on, y'all.
You're like brothers.
Fuck that.
You are brothers!
Fuck that.
We used to be like brothers.
All right,
we're going to squash it.
What do you say?
Bishop?
Yeah, it's cool.
All right.
I'm not makin' sense!
You're not makin' sense!
You know why?
What?
Uh, how you doin'?
Is Yolanda there?
Who the hell are you?
Hi, Q.
Let him in, Frank.
Have a seat.
I'm just cleaning out
some of Frank's things.
Um, Frank, Q.
Q. Frank.
How you doin'?
Q.
What, did names like
Mustafah and Akbar
become too hard
to spell?
My real name is Quincy,
and I'm not too fond
of that name,
so people call me Q
or GQ. You know,
like a nickname,
abbreviation.
Well, uh, Quincy,
shouldn't you be out stealing
hubcaps or something like that?
Asshole.
Excuse me? Speak up.
I can't hear you, boy.
O.K., Frank, I found it.
Remember these?
Ha ha ha.
What the hell are you laughing at,
you chain snatcher?
Look, who is this kid,
and what is he
doing here?
Frank, don't you think
it's a little late
to try acting
like a husband now?
You're taking this
save-the-children shit too far.
Bye.
Just telling you
for your own good.
Bye, Frank.
I can't express
concern, what?
So that's him, huh?
That's him.
You know, he got a real
attitude problem.
Definitely.
Mmm, baby.
You're sweatin' already.
I been working out.
You don't mind
a little sweat, do you?
Now I lay me
down to sleep
I pray my Lord
my soul to keep
Mmm.
Want some?
Mm-mmm.
What time is it?
I pray my Lord
my soul to take
Past 10:00.
I got to get
ready for work.
And you'll be sayin'
daddy to me
Mmm.
Hmm. Why you playin'
with my spot?
You say you got to
get ready for work.
Is that your spot?
Yeah. You know
it's my spot.
Wish I could
spend the night,
know what I'm sayin'?
That would be nice.
Sleep all day.
I could make you
breakfast in bed.
That'd be dope. That'd
be the most word, huh?
I... I think you'd better let me
deal with breakfast.
I can cook.
Mm-hmm.
You can cook, all right.
Ha.
What's up?
Yo, what's up,
money?
What are you
doin' here, man?
We got a meeting
at the ball court.
When is it?
Tomorrow mornin'.
I can't make it, man.
What do you mean,
you can't make it?
I got a real important
appointment.
Well, how important is it?
It's my deejay audition.
Oh, man.
All right, Q.
I'm going to
straighten this out
with the rest
of the boys,
but make sure you
get there after you're done.
This is
serious business,
so we're gonna
wait for you.
That's cool.
Why don't you tell me
what it is now,
get it over with?
Later.
By the way,
good luck, man.
Smooth.
What do you mean,
it ain't good enough?
My name is Flex.
Look, this brother
look like Gumby.
What you talkin' about,
I ain't good enough?
I mean exactly
what I said.
You need
more experience.
You need to work
on your mixing more.
My... my...
what you mean?
What the fuck's
wrong with my mix?
I know you didn't
snatch that from me.
What's wrong
with my mix?
Look, the shit
is totally sloppy.
Only a fool would
open up like you.
Nobody likes
the records you play.
It's completely
whacked... face it!
Face it.
Fuck you!
You might have a chance
if that shit
wasn't so small.
Next!
You ever deejay before?
Yeah, you know,
run away, make tapes
for my boys, stuff like that.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, you local.
I really
liked your tape.
Thank you.
I'll see you
Saturday night.
What is your name?
GQ.
GQ.
Come on.
Yes!
You know, I think
you and me can be closer
than two craps
together coming out...
What's happen, Trip?
Yo, yo, my brother.
Heard you made that deejay comp.
Congratulations.
GQ. You know
what I'm sayin'?
All right.
What's up, man?
I made that deejay contest
Saturday night.
Once again, it's on.
What you talkin' about?
It's on.
What's this nigger
talkin' about now?
Stickin' up Old Man Quiles
Saturday night.
What? Man, you better
stop bullshittin' me.
I ain't bullshittin' you.
What, is you scared?
Steel ain't scared,
are you, Steel?
Here come Raheem.
Yo, what's up, Q?
What's up, man?
Chillin'.
You got it?
Yeah, I got it.
Come on, let's walk.
What's goin' on
with this garbage?
Check this out.
Oh, shit!
This shit is sweet.
I got it from Sweets.
I ain't never
shot nobody before.
Yo, be careful with that.
It's loaded.
Quiles is not
gonna draw on somebody
that got a gun on him.
It's gonna be
a piece of cake.
A piece of cake.
We go in
right before 11:00,
get the loot, and jet.
The whole thing won't take longer
than three fuckin' minutes.
You decided it
this morning without me?
Yeah. While you was at
your, uh, appointment.
Check this here, man.
I got to deejay
Saturday night.
I'm not missin' that.
Guess you got to
disappoint them.
I ain't disappointin' shit.
Maybe not.
There's going to be
a lot of deejays there, right?
Yeah.
How do they pick
who goes when?
There's 40 deejays,
all I know is
I go seventh.
We're going to
need an alibi.
Since you're
going seventh,
that'll give us
an opportunity to go in,
do what we got to do,
and jet.
Get the fuck
out of there.
I think that'll work.
What about the cops?
Bishop checked it out.
There's two
overlappin' patrols
about three minutes apart.
We got to be fast.
Yo, I think we should
plan this another time.
This nigger's scared!
I have to deejay
Saturday night.
Fuck that shit!
We're goin' Saturday night,
and that's it.
I'll hold onto the gun.
Why him?
'Cause I already got it,
motherfucker!
Just let him
hold the gun.
The nigger be
acting stupid.
Shut up!
Suck my dick.
What time you
gotta be there?
Before 9:00.
We'll pick up your shit,
go over there,
set you up...
You'll be straight, man.
Goin'down
for the count
Suckers get
smacked up
Goin'down
for the count
Suckers get
smacked up
Yo, what's up,
everybody in the house,
and welcome to
the Mixxmaster Massacre,
the ultimate deejay battle
of world supremacy
won by a round
of sudden death
till only the best are left.
Cut it up, y'all.
Suckers get smacked up,
suckers get smacked up
Suckers get
smacked up
Hello?
Yo, man, you O.K.?
I'm chillin'.
All right, man,
good luck.
Enjoy.
Fab 5 Freddie here.
Battles going on,
but each contestant
only has 20 seconds
to go for the gusto.
So let's do it!
Are you having
a good time?
Make some noise.
Somebody say ho.
Ho!
Say ho! Ho!
Ho! Ho!
Yeah! That's the
hyped crowd I like.
