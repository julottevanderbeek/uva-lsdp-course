Waiter!
What's that?
Oh, my god.
Hi.
Madam.
Thank you.
Woman: Hold on one second.
Well, yes.
Hold on one second.
One second.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Cassie Jane, I'm the features
editor at the paper.
We spoke on the phone earlier.
It's, um...
Laura Quinn.
Robin, go ahead.
I got front page?
Perfect. Thanks.
Thanks, bye.
Whoo! We should be careful
what we wish for. Hmm.
Having it all at 25 cannot
be biologically correct.
So, thank you
for contacting us.
As you know, we're
running a series
of features
called "Women Who Led."
All about the everyday women
who back in the late fifties,
the early sixties,
started breaking
the boundaries,
really inventing
the modern woman.
A lot of people who
turned up in our research
turned out to be dead,
but you're...
alive, so that's great.
I, um, I need
to paint a picture.
You're hired by the London
Diamond Corporation.
It's number one in the world.
It is the fifties.
It's a fiercely
male-dominated environment.
You take on the men.
You battle your way up
and become... a manager.
Well, that's not going to
impress anyone these days,
but you were the only female
manager that had ever existed
in that company and I want
to know your story.
You know, I haven't
set foot in this city
as a free woman
in over 40 years.
Really?
It's changed.
It's an exceptional
piece, isn't it?
very rare.
I stole it...
from London Diamond.
Good deal took place
at London Diamond.
It may not be
in your notes.
You've been in prison.
That's where you've been.
Good morning,
gentlemen.
Miss Quinn, good morning.
Good morning,
Miss Quinn.
Good morning,
Miss Quinn.
Good morning, Mr. Hobbs.
Aiming to beat
the sunrise, Miss Quinn?
Literate, Henry.
Literate.
No more blood for diamonds!
I see our fan club
is assembled.
Murderer!
Murderer!
Good morning, Mr. Milton.
Good morning,
Mr. Milton.
Morning, gents.
Good morning.
I'm sure by now
you're all aware...
tensions reached a head
yesterday in Kimstad.
What are
the final figures?
What do you mean?
Dead? How many dead?
A hundred, give or take,
most of them on our pay roll.
It is a cock-up.
Everyone is pointing
their fingers at us.
Christ Almighty!
The whole pissing South
African regime is our fault.
What are the Soviets saying?
I'm afraid the Russians
are leading the charge.
They're pressing
for U.N. sanctions.
They're going to war with us
the week that we are
renewing their contracts.
We don't need
the Russians.
With respect, sir,
if the soviets broke away,
it would be disastrous.
They could align
with Botswana,
Sierra Leone,
or even Angola.
Combined production
would exceed our own.
We would no longer
control global supply.
The cartel collapses
and prices would free fall.
The Russians are paid
well above market.
They won't
break ranks.
In any case, officials from the
Soviet diamond trading organization
are en route
as we speak.
Precisely.
To end our relationship.
Very well.
Now we have two days.
Two days to find
a solution.
Wait, wait, uh, um...
one final item.
I'd like you to join me
in congratulating
our newest
Managing Director,
who, god willing, will keep
us afloat in Cape Town,
Mr. Peter Boland.
Congratulations.
Well done.
I'm speechless.
Boland over you?
The old man
is losing his mind.
No, he's
thinking straight.
In addition to being
several years my senior,
Boland's experience is far
better suited to the position.
Besides, they're doing
me a favor.
Didn't you know cape town's
a furnace in the summer?
Well, I hope that they've got
something better lined up for you.
"Lon Di subsidiaries worldwide, 1,223.
"Female Managing Directors,
"0."
"Don't give up.
"Work harder.
"You will win."
You forgot again.
Lunch?
Lunch?
It's a holiday,
middle of the day,
people meet, unwind,
buy make-up, plot against men.
Oh, it's all the rage.
I'm so sorry.
Look, it's one crisis
after another.
Can we reschedule?
Tuesday it is,
but not with me,
with Kenneth Pearson,
a friend of mine that
would like to meet you.
Judy, it's so kind,
but I really don't like
the name Kenneth.
Don't leave it
too long, Laura.
There won't be
any plots left.
Oh, working late again,
Miss Quinn?
Always the first to arrive
and the last to leave.
Your colleagues must value
your dedication.
What's that bit from
the, uh, from the Bible?
You know, "he who
is last shall be first
"and he who is first
shall be last."
Is that how it goes?
Yeah.
What a load of rubbish.
We all know you
take what you desire.
Fortune favors the bold.
Take those South Africans,
for example.
Do you think we should
hand them their freedom
or let them seize it
for themselves?
Well, that's an interesting
debate, but a dangerous one maybe.
But for my money,
I'd say things are never as
simple as they would seem.
I'm sure
you're right, Miss Quinn.
You're the one with the suit.
Good night.
Good luck.
Living dangerously,
Miss Quinn?
Recklessly, Henry.
Recklessly.
Man: Something troubling you,
Miss Quinn?
The existing
Russian contract.
I propose
we simply extend it.
I'm sorry.
You've lost me.
Was it not you that
suggested the Russians
were on their way
here to sever all ties?
If we allow the soviets to publicly
disassociate with London Diamond,
let them pound
the table at the U.N.,
denounce racist capitalism
and so on and so on,
but secretly
we extend our contract
and keep it a strictly
private matter,
at least until the storm
has passed over.
While they continue
to wholesale
diamonds at
a magnificent price.
That's not bad.
That's not bad at all.
Who else have
you told about this?
Man: It's much better now
than it ever was.
Second man:
In such a short time.
Laura, is that you?
Harold Reynolds, good god.
Gentlemen, this lady
is the cleverest person
I've ever met,
and she's American.
Ran circles around
the lot of us at Oxford.
Of course I don't
talk to her anymore.
She turned me down
for dinner three times.
I was just
testing his resolve.
If he had tried one more
time, I would have said yes.
I'm with allied banking
heading up syndications.
We've just been sweating
over your accounts.
A lot of ice down there.
No doubt impressive, but
it's making people nervous.
But now I know you're here,
I can sleep a little easier.
Um, unless of course you're
considering a career change,
with allied banking,
world domination
can also be arranged.
Henry: Earliest and brightest
as usual, Miss Quinn.
Oh, I do my best, Henry.
Thank you.
No, you won't.
Miss Quinn.
Miss Quinn.
Why don't we sit
in there?
Mr. Hobbs?
Yes.
Mr. Hobbs, I'm flattered,
but I'm... I'm... I'm
really not looking.
Oh, please... please
don't panic, Miss Quinn.
I'm... I'm a happily
married man.
And I wouldn't be
so courageous.
I... I have a proposal
to put to you.
It's... it's a trifle.
Just give me
five minutes. Please.
Come and sit.
It's something
I do to get sympathy.
War wound. The Blitz.
My wife and I, we went
for some music at Wilton's.
Very explosive performance.
Anyway, we both
survived that one,
only to find out that my wife
was living on borrowed time.
I thought you were
happily married?
Oh, I am, Miss Quinn.
And I always will be.
Are you always in the habit of
reading private correspondence?
Would you hold these
for me, please?
Correspondence?
This is more like
a diary of frustration.
"Number of Lon Di
subsidiaries worldwide 1,223."
"Number of female
Managing Directors, 0."
That first number
is not correct.
It's 1,224 now,
but the other number,
that is quite accurate.
You've succeeded
in arousing my curiosity.
Now, I'm wondering
what it is you want.
Well, I... I think the
question is, Miss Quinn, is,
what is it
that you want?
Hey, this is ridiculous.
They're... they're going
to knock over a bank
in the middle of London
in broad daylight.
I could have
your job for this.
Yeah, and they might
just give it to you.
I know that you've been
passed over six times
in the last three years
for someone less
qualified than you.
You know this has
been illuminating,
but I am really
am very, very busy.
Miss Quinn, please.
Please sit down.
Please sit down. Please.
I... I haven't got
to my point yet.
They're going
to fire you.
Excuse me?
Yes, your ingenious
Russian proposal.
How do you know
about that?
How do you know
all of my business?
Shh!
Shh!
I'm only trying to help.
You know,
it's extraordinary
the conversations people will
have in front of their cleaners.
It's like...
like we don't exist.
What conversations?
Well, I'm not a businessman,
but I certainly
got the gist of it.
What conversations?
Well, the Russians
won't accept your plan
unless it's kept secret
among senior staff...
and only
the senior staff.
They don't seem to think
that you qualify.
Well, I don't believe you.
Well, uh, you...
you're probably right.
The ramblings
of an old man, eh?
Who would notice?
Hey, this is a good bit.
Look there.
Would you like a peanut?
Oh, is MKA in?
He's just left.
That's odd.
Someone from the Prime
Minister's Office is in the lobby.
Says he has
an appointment.
Hmm.
Oh, no, that's
not right at all.
Ahem.
Well, I seem
to be the end
of the whole restaurant.
You look wonderful.
Well, I heard reinvention
was the latest craze.
Thought I'd try
it on for size.
Thank you for seeing me.
Well, don't thank me
too quickly.
Um, ahem.
It's bad news, I'm afraid.
We can't offer you a position.
Really, why not?
There's a conflict
of interests.
Lon Di is our largest client,
back to the Boer War.
We funded Ernest Ashtoncroft's
first diamond mines 70 years ago.
Well, it's done
all the time.
You simply ask their
permission to speak with me.
Say I know nothing
about it, unsolicited.
That sort of thing.
I did.
Look, and I tell you this
in confidence as an old friend.
But they're saying you're
grossly incompetent.
Claim you botched their
relations with the Russians.
That is absolutely
ridiculous.
I am sorry.
Word came down quietly you
are not to be touched by us
or in all likelihood by anyone
doing business with Lon Di.
Well, that's every
last company on earth.
You said you, um,
had something else to discuss.
Well, I... I feel
stupid now.
I was going to finally
accept your offer of dinner.
Well, that, um, would have
to be unadventurous.
Married now five years,
three rather boisterous
girls to prove it.
You should come
over one Sunday.
Mmm, good soup.
Early lunch, Miss Quinn?
Very early
and very long.
I'm taking
the afternoon off.
Placed a bet,
Miss Quinn?
Oh, I never gamble.
Not on dogs, cards,
or strangers.
You were right.
Was I?
Why do you want to steal
from the company?
Who said I did?
Hypothetically.
War and plunder,
the two most reliable
sources of income.
I didn't realize
we were at war.
In six months' time
I shall retire
to a hearty pat on the back
and a not to hearty pension,
a situation
in dire need of attention.
So money, plain
and simple?
Suppose I wanted to do
something for my wife.
Your wife
who died 15 years ago?
The one you're
happily married to?
Lovely. You did
your homework.
I guess you would.
What else
did you uncover?
That you're far
from stupid,
and you were forced to
apprentice under your father,
the one
with the drinking problem.
Oh, yes, married at 21 and years
later when your wife became ill,
you took the night job
at London Diamonds
so you could spend
your days by her side.
You never did use
those qualifications.
Clever, Miss Quinn.
Clever.
How do you know
I won't turn you in?
Are we still speaking
hypothetically?
I mean, what makes you think
you can pull off such a thing?
Well, simply because
I have a plan.
What I propose involves
the least possible risk
because we don't have to
change our normal routines.
Each night at 9:00...
they lock the front doors,
which means,
that for 10 hours,
no one can go in
or out of the building.
They increase the security
on the main floor
but on the lower floor they
just keep these two guards,
here and here
by the lift,
which is the sole
point of access.
You intend to go
for the vault?
That's where
the diamonds are.
You can't be serious.
Generally, each evening I
start on the fourth floor
and work
me way down, see?
Nice day today.
Once through
the outer floors
I'm escorted
to the sub basement.
The next few hours are
spent on rubbish collection,
mopping, waxing, minor
repair and maintenance.
During that time,
I'll work mostly unattended.
Once an hour or so,
someone checks up on me.
Otherwise, I'm
left entirely to myself.
I mean, in theory,
I could take off all my
clothes and walk around naked.
A frightening thought,
Miss Quinn.
Don't dwell on it.
I'll try not to.
I've saved the vault
hallway for last.
The long corridor that leads
to a circular door,
behind which
lies one of the largest singular
deposits of riches on earth.
For 16 years
I've been working
within a hare's
breath of that door,
and for 16 years I've never
opened it, not once.
You couldn't if you wanted
to, not without the codes.
The codes are changed weekly
and entrusted to only two people.
Mr. Eaton, lifelong company
servant, portrait of reliability.
Rumor has it that the swiss use
his pulse to set their clocks by.
And, of course, Sir Milton
Kendrick Ashtoncroft,
aging ruler of everything
that daylight touches.
And you plan to obtain
the codes how?
That's where you come in,
Miss Quinn.
Until recently, this was
supposed to be a solo operation.
A year ago, quite by accident,
I discovered that Sir Milton kept
the codes concealed in his desk.
Then some months back,
they were gone.
Night after night,
I searched the office,
but they never turned up.
Why'd you wait?
Why not do it while
you had the chance?
Oh, I've asked myself that
question a thousand times.
I told you, I'm...
I'm not courageous.
But my hesitating
will be your gain.
Will it?
And what will
that require?
Here, proof of conviction.
You are on the, uh,
guest list, are you?
It's business.
I'm expected.
We're entertaining
the Russians.
You suspect he keeps
the codes at home?
On Saturday, go to his study
and look under the center
drawer in his desk.
This is ridiculous.
Say I did find the codes
and you were able to slip in
and out of the vault undetected.
How would you get the
diamonds out of the building?
How much will it hold?
How much would
you like it to hold?
What's the price of revenge?
Difficult, eh?
Would a million pound do?
Each?
I should think so.
They wouldn't even
notice that much.
Well, by then...
I'll be retired and
you'll have been let go.
Why should I trust you?
The same reason
I have to trust you.
We have the same objective.
Oh, you make it all
sound so easy.
Is that a yes?
No, it isn't.
Be sure to wear
something nice.
Good evening, sir.
Come on in.
The Russians here?
To pressurized carbon.
Here here!
Now that's
a sight worth seeing.
Sir Clifton Sinclair, our
very own insurance man,
making a rare trip down from
his ivory tower at King's Row.
No doubt losing sleep over our
somewhat top heavy inventory.
Oh, I don't think Sinclair's
the type to lose sleep.
It's rather unnerving
to consider a man
with that history as London
diamond's greatest guarantor.
Ooh, you didn't know.
He was mixed up in all
those insurance scandals
before the national
health service.
Of course, he's
completely innocent,
or he was never prosecuted.
Otherwise, we wouldn't
do business together.
Allow me to present
Vladimir Dmitriev,
head of the Soviet
Diamond Authority.
Mr. Chanson,
my second in command.
How do you do?
And miss
Laura Quinn,
one of our
brightest gems.
Ballet, vodka, diamonds,
the three things closest
to the Russian soul.
And which do you prefer?
Diamonds, of course.
I'll drink to that.
My lord!
And what would you have
done had I said ballet?
I would ask you to dance.
Of course, I have
ulterior motives.
And, um, what makes
you think I don't?
I shall miss her.
How's the old man
bearing up?
Oh, I expect
he'll outlive us all.
Well, I only ask because
I should think hoarding
basically a worthless commodity
would be very bad for his heart.
What am I doing?
I ask myself that
repeatedly.
Sorry.
I didn't see you.
Purely by design.
You've stumbled into my lair,
my sanctuary of sorts.
Yes, I think I know
what you mean.
At least the evening
is a success.
Your father's spared
no expense.
Never does,
always first class,
so long as it's discreet
and doesn't attract attention.
Yes, he's famous
for his discretion.
Is it true he paid 100
pounds to the families
of the miners
who died in protest?
Anonymously.
Pulled the bullets
from the caskets.
Should be a discount
for that.
What sort of man
does such a thing?
A man of conscience.
Miss Quinn: Mr. Hobbs.
I'm having trouble with
the heat in my office.
Uh, Miss Quinn,
do you want...
more or less heat
in your office?
If we do this, I want
to know every last detail.
Understand?
Ok.
Man: Now, if you just
lock it off under there.
We have to call it off.
They've installed
security cameras.
Closed Circuit Television
monitoring everything.
I've been with them all
morning showing interest.
Cameras in the building?
Yes, inside, outside,
halls, lobby.
In the vault?
No, but
the vault corridor.
They don't want
security guards staring
at mounds
of diamonds all day.
Can you blame them?
Oh, security cameras,
goodness gracious.
What'll they
think up next?
Is there any way
around them?
No, absolutely not.
No?
There are eight
separate cameras
covering the entire
sub basement,
including one dedicated
to the vault corridor.
The cameras link
to the guard station,
and Eaton has a man on watch 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
Basement's here.
We've got reception,
boardroom, the corridor.
So you'll just have to
reconsider that pension of yours.
All right.
So, fool proof, eh?
And you came all the way
over to the wrong side
of town to tell me...
when you could've
told me tonight.
You've seen a way,
haven't you?
I have not, Mr. Hobbs.
Your tenacity reminds
me of my wife.
Why are you being
so persistent?
Because I hate
English winters.
Now, tell me how
it can be done.
All right. There's
one possibility,
but I'm telling you,
it won't work.
Although there are eight
cameras in the sub basement,
only four images are on
screen at any one time.
Four on, four off,
and since the images cycle
in 15-second intervals,
they reappear
in the order they leave.
So each image
is off-screen for...
Yeah, 60 seconds,
but that's not enough time.
Enough time?
I'll be in that vault
in 10 seconds flat.
You can't be standing
outside the vault
when the image goes
off screen
and be nowhere in sight
when it reappears.
You have to start
at the end of the corridor,
and that's 40 yards long.
Well, I don't have
a problem with that.
With all due respect,
Mr. Hobbs,
you can hardly walk,
let alone run.
I'm telling you,
I can do it.
This has gone too far.
I'm sorry.
You're involved now,
whether you like it or not.
I beg your pardon.
You gave me the code, Miss
Quinn, so you're involved.
Make no mistake.
I'm going through
with this.
And don't you pretend
to me that you don't want it,
because you want
it more than I do.
You want a life that means
something that adds up.
And you know that this is the
only way you're going to get it.
Miss Quinn,
you said it yourself.
They're never going
to notice it.
This is how it'll work.
Tomorrow we'll
synchronize our watches,
but it has
to be tomorrow
before they realize
the flaw in the system.
At the exact moment you're
at the vault corridor,
I'll call
the guard station.
That should buy you at
least 30 more seconds.
When this is over, I think
best we not speak again.
Evening, Miss Quinn.
Evening, Henry.
Evening, Henry.
Albert.
Evening, Miss Quinn.
May I?
What's the word,
Henry?
Ask me again on Friday.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Ah!
Ah!
Damn it.
Willis.
Hello?
Man: Halt!
I'm afraid
there's a problem.
If you won't mind,
come along with me.
Uh...
Mr. Lewis, I'm afraid.
God knows what
that man ingests.
Would you mind?
I'll, uh,
leave you to it.
Mr. Hobbs.
Morning, Miss Quinn.
How are things
this morning, Henry?
In a word, dull.
