Do you want to know what this is all about?
You can say it's about drugs, or guns
disaffected youth or....
Whatever you like...
But this whole thing is about parenting.
It is about taking care of your children.
You take care of yours, I take care of mine.
I'm sorry I don't understand
What does that mean?
That's all I have to say about that subject.
Next question?
You're son was a drug dealer?
Drug dealer? No.
Did he/she sell a little weed? Yeah.
A little weed? He was a major supplier
in the San Gabriel valley.
I don't know anything about that.
What about the D. A. 's assertion that
your son got his marijuana from you...
and that you have tied to organized crime?
What is this amateur night bullshit?
That isn't an interrogation.  Alright?
I am a taxpayer and I'm a citizen.
And you are a jerk-off.
Did I tell you that?
Crac
Come on Johnny, why don't I feed you behind
if you're busting hard work I'm fucking your
Mom and your sister....
ahh Shit! What's that Tiko?
What did you say?
I heard you say you want to suck my cock right?
Primero would have to grow.
Shit, mines got so big it's got a name
It's hot out there
-What you doing, Elvis? Is it dark outside?
-What?
I'm paying you for a full day right?
I've been here since 10 o'clock this morning.
I hate that shit.
I asked you a question.
D'you see the fucking moon, Elvis?
-It's definitely daylight.
-Hey! I'll show you my moon.
Johnny, I did everything that you say.
The house is clean. I went to the store.
There is food and beer in the fridge.
The wash is done. Adolf's fed.
The grass is cut.  It is all done, man.
Well, I guess you shouldn't finish so fast huh?.
Shut the fuck up!
-Hey, never mind that!
-Never mind that!
Get back to fucking work!
You want something to do. .
Go wash the floors, scrub out the toilets. .
or better yet pick up all the dog shit
that's in the back yard.
And if you finish too fast...
-dump it out and...
-Pick it back up again
-Shut the fuck up, bitch!
-Get you a pooper-scooper
-Touchy
-It's messed up, man.
-What?
When am I going to get my money, Elvis?
When?

Well, how much is the cheque?
I don't know. It depends on the hours.
Well, how many hours did you work, bitch?
I can't remember.

Why is this mother-fucker talking anyway?
I thought we taped him up?
He couldn't breathe.
Just drop me off on the strip.
I'm going to fucking fiesta.
I'm not going to let this little
mother-fucker spoil my weekend.
-What about me?
-No
-No, what?
-He stays with you.
-What?
-I said fucking queer as a deaf mother-fucker
-Why me, dude?
-Because I fucking said so.
Don't fuck around man.
I can't fucking take him to my
Dad's house like that.
Well then, untie him, genius!
You heard the kid...
-You aren't running are you?
-What?
No.
Go home, tell Juergen that he's your new little
butt buddy and he is spending the night.
Meanwhile, I'll talk to Mazursky.
He must be going crazy, right now.
Hey, what's going on?
It's a mad house.
Your brother is scaring the shit
out of all of us.
Did they call the friends?
Maybe he has a girl?
We tried everything. Friends,
cops, hospitals... nothing. .
Don't you think the kid is out
just fucking around?
I mean you can't keep the kid
locked in the house forever
Maybe, I don't know.
We did have an argument this morning.
OK, well that's what it is then, right?
I hope so.
-Well, what do you think?
-I don't know.
But...
We can't rule anything out.
I'll have to ask you a few questions, ok?
Do you know anyone who
would want to hurt Zack?
-No.
-You?
-Me what?
-You've a beef with anyone
I oughta know about?
That person you owe money to?
You owe somebody money?
Jesus! Just tell me how much and
I will write the cheque.
-It is not really like that, Olivia.
-Really? What's it like?
Tell me what it's like, god damn you!
Fuck. Bring him back.
Please relax.
Bring him back!
Back here!
I am going to find him.
I promise you.
I promise.
I will find him.
Where are you going?
Where's Johnny?
Don't know Dog, is he here?
-That is what I am asking you
-Excuse me. We were talking.
Klemash, where the fucking kid?
I ain't seen him, dude.
What the fuck is that?. . Behind your back

-What's the problem here?
-Shut your big ass
Don't touch her!
Asshole!

I turned my back and tell Truelove...
...you fucking ran away or something...
What do you think about that?
I don't know, Frankie.  I mean...

So I think; I'm just going to ride it out.

-Hello
-I fucking hear you
There's coffee but Bessy got up late so
I need you to straighten up the house.
I'm supposed to clean up after your party?
I know I moan like a bitch.
Don't argue with me. I am in no mood.
Look, I came home yesterday and
your shit is all over the house.
We had a deal remember?
Get a job, pay rent...
Alright! Fuck!
Get out of my room!
Nice fucking mouth.
Fucking dick.
Hey. Don't worry about it.
I'll help you with the work.
Juergen is botanical. He grows
everything we eat right here.
Tomato, cucumbers, corn.
Fucking spices and shit.
Fucker is a full blown alcoholic,
smokes like a chimney...
...but, Goddamn, if we don't eat healthy.
Look at this shit right here.
Daddy's pride and joy.
Cause the greedy bastard will smoke 'em
all but it's Frankie's job to take care of them.
Water them, throw some egg shells
on them every now and then.
Well fuck it
Let's get to work.
Shit. I'll be right back.
-Hey Girl!
-What's going on?
-Nothing. Working.
Are you guys coming over?
You got that shit?
You know I do.
Mom.  I'm going to Frankie's.
-Did you talk to him?
-It's all good.
-When will you be home?
-I don't know. Late probably.
Darling, can you stay with Julie
and Sabrina tonight? It's your father
and my anniversary
Anniversary!
-You gonna have a little sex or some...?
-That's disgusting.
Whatever! I'm interested.
I mean, really, are you going to go down on him?
-Give him a little tube stick boogie?
-No!
Oh come on! Live a little.
You guys have been married what. .
...500 years?
Keith Straten! I will knock the
shit out of you, you little skunk!
OK We're leaving.
Get your keys? Lets go get
Sabrina and Julie.
Yo! Youngblood.  Come here, man.
Ladies...
Dick Wad, Fuckweed
Susan.
Hi.
Sabrina, Julie,
Dick Wad
OK.  OK, let's go smoke some
fucking weed, man!
But, hey, listen.
No-one messes up my shit, alright?
This house ain't never been
so fucking clean
You fucking blow this game.
I don't fucking blow. You just died, man.
-I thought I was the other guy.
-That's me.
I thought I was playing the other dude.
-Suck my balls!
-Fuck you. Suck my balls, man
You suck it bitch.
So, how old are you?
How old do I look?
About 12.
Well, I am 17, but I do look really young.
I am going to kill your ass, kill your ass.
-Stop the game.
-No! Go answer your phone.
Suck it!
Suck it!
Fuck you
Yo Johnny! What's up?
Did you talk to anybody?
Look, man, I can't keep the
kid here much longer.
-Nothing, just having some people over.
-Nobody. Shut up
Nobody, just some people.
Chill Out, dog!
Alright, alright, I'll clear it up.
I need you to do a favour for me, bro.
Johnny is coming and I need the house.
Will you watch the kid for me for a little while?
Watch him?
Keep an eye on him, no phones...
...and no leaving him alone.
No phones?
I don't get it.
Alright, look, if I tell you something
can you keep your fucking mouth shut?
Yeah, 'course, man.
Yeah.
The kids brother owes Truelove money...
...and Johnny's holding him like a
marker or something until he gets paid
