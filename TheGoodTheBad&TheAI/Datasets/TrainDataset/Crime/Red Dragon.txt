####
Think to yourself
that every day is your last.
####
The hour to which you
do not look forward...
will come
as a welcome surprise.
As for me, when you
want a good laugh,
you will find me
in fine state...
fat and sleek,
a true hog
of Epicurus's herd.
And we find you
cribbing lines
from Horace as well.
Well done, John.
I must say, Hannibal,
speaking for the rest
of the herd...
I'm sorry.
For the symphony board.
Oh.
These little soirees of yours
are always the highlight
of our year.
Just so.
Yes.
- You're too kind.
-I do feel a bit guilty enjoying
such a lovely evening...
when one of our musicians
is still listed
as a "Missing Person."
- Yes. Poor Fellow.
- Shall I confess
something wicked?
I can't help feeling
just the tiniest bit,
well,
relieved.
It sounds awful,
I know, but...
let's face it... so does
the man's playing.
Hannibal, confess.
What is this divine-looking
amuse bouche?
If I tell you,
I'm afraid
you won't even try it.
Mmm.
Special Agent Graham.
What an unexpected pleasure.
I'm sorry to bother you
again, Dr. Lecter.
I know it's very late.
There's no bother.
We're both night owls,
I think.
Come in, please.
Thank you.
Let me take your coat.
So, what's on your mind?
We've been on the wrong track
this whole time, Doctor,
you and I.
Our whole profile's
wrong.
We've been looking
for someone
with a crazy grudge...
and some kind of
anatomical knowledge.
Decertified doctors,
med-school dropouts,
laid-off mortuary workers.
From the precision of the cuts,
yes, and his choice
of souvenirs.
That's where we're
off-target. He's not
collecting body parts.
Then why keep them?
He's not keeping them.
He's eating them.
No, listen.
We were at Molly's
parents for New Year's,
and Molly's dad was
showing my son, Josh,
how to carve a roasted chicken.
Yeah?
He said, "The tenderest
part of the chicken...
is the oysters
here on either side
of the back."
I had never heard
that expression
before..."oysters."
Then suddenly,
I had a flash
of the third victim.
Darcy Taylor...
she was missing
flesh from her back.
And then it hit me...
liver, kidney, tongue,
thymus.
Every single victim
lost some body part
used in cooking.
Have you shared this
with the Bureau?
No. I-I needed
to see you first,
but I'm right.
I know I'm right.
I'm-I'm starting to be able
to think like this one.
Yeah, that's fascinating.
You know, I'd always
suspected as much.
I'm-I'm not psychic,
Doctor.
No, no, no.
This is different,
more akin
to artistic imagination.
You're able to assume
the emotional point of view
of other people,
even those that might
scare or sicken you.
It's a troubling gift,
I should think.
How I'd love
to get you on my couch.
Something still doesn't
make sense to me.
You're the best
forensic psychiatrist
I know.
And somehow, in all our time
together, this possibility
never occurred to you.
Well, I am only human, Will.
Perhaps I have made a mistake.
You don't strike me
as a man who makes
very many mistakes.
Now I'm starting to think
that I might no longer
enjoy your full confidence.
No, no. I did...
I didn't say that.
I didn't...
I don't... I don't know
what I'm saying.
I'm very, very tired.
I-I almost had it.
It'll come to you.
Look, why don't you
come back in the morning?
I'll clear some time on
my schedule. Then we can get
started on revising our profile.
Sound good?
Yeah.
You rest here,
and I'll get your coat.
Won't be a tick.
Shh.
Don't move.
You're in shock now.
I don't want you
to feel any pain.
In a moment, you'll begin
to be lightheaded, then drowsy.
Don't resist.
It's so gentle, like
slipping into a warm bath.
Shh.
I regret
it came to this, Will.
But every game
must have its ending.
Shh.
Remarkable boy.
I do admire your courage.
Oh!
I think I'll eat your heart.
Oh! Oh!
Hey, Dad.
Someone's here.
Hey.
You've got a beautiful
setup here, Will.
Yeah. It's good.
You know
why I'm here?
Yeah. I can guess.
How much
do you know?
Just what was in
The Miami Herald
and the Times.
Two families killed
a month apart
in their homes.
Birmingham
and Atlanta.
Circumstances
were similar.
Not similar. The same.
What have you kept
out of the papers?
He smashes mirrors
and uses the pieces.
Wears latex gloves,
so we've got no prints.
Size-11 shoe.
He's not too comfortable
with locks.
Pried open a patio door
in Birmingham.
Used a glass cutter in Atlanta.
Oh, and his blood's
AB positive.
Somebody hurt him?
Nope.
We typed him
from semen and saliva.
He's a secretor.
Tell me something, Will.
You knew what this was.
Did you ever consider
picking up the phone
and maybe giving me a call?
You've got all
the people you need.
You've got Dortmund
up at Harvard.
You've got Bloom in Chicago.
And I've got you down here
fixing fuckin' boat motors.
Yeah. I like
fixing boat motors.
I wouldn't be
very useful to you
anyway.
I don't think about
this stuff anymore.
Really?
Last two we had,
you caught.
By doing the same things
you and the other guys
are doing.
That's not entirely true.
It's the way you think.
Come on. There's been
a lot of bullshit
about the way I think.
I've got technicians that
can examine evidence, but
you've got that other thing.
Imagination, projection,
whatever.
Yeah.
I know you don't like
that part of it.
You wouldn't like it either.
This freak killed the Jacobis
in Birmingham on Saturday night,
February 25. Full moon.
He killed the Leeds family
in Atlanta a few nights ago.
March 28. That's one day
short of a lunar month.
If we're lucky, we may have
a little over three weeks
before he does it again.
Will, do you respect
my judgment?
Yeah, of course.
I think we have a better chance
to catch him fast if you help.
Go to Atlanta and look.
Just look.
Then help me brief
the locals. That's it.
Crawford has
the whole damn government.
What does he need you for?
He just wants me to look
at some evidence, Molly,
give him another
point of view.
It's... It's a few days...
a week maybe... and I'll be
right back.
- And you believe that?
- Yes.
I mean... Look it,
these kinds of cases
come along very rarely.
- And I've had experience.
- Yes, you have.
You're paid up, Will.
All of us, even Josh.
There's a chance that I can
help them save some lives.
How do I say no to that?
This one...
This one will never see me
or know my name.
I'll just help them find him.
The cops will have to
take him down, not me.
I'll be in the back
of the pack, Molly.
I promise.
Never in your life.
I know you.
Come on. Come here.
Come here.
I love you.
See you in a few days.
Okay.
I'll call you tonight.
Bye, Dad.
Where's the dog?
No one heard barking.
There's nothing about it
in the case file.
The intruder enters in the dark
and cuts Charles Leeds's throat.
He shoots Valerie Leeds
in the stomach as she's rising,
disabling her
but not killing her.
He leaves her
to watch her husband die...
and turns
and goes down the hall.
The children were st...
The children were
still in their beds
when they were shot,
which might indicate
that he used a silencer.
He dragged the bodies
into the master bedroom,
but why bother?
They were already dead, and
none of them got the same...
extra attention
as Mrs. Leeds.
Small pieces of mirror were
inserted in the orbital sockets
of the victims.
This occurred postmortem.
Why did you put mirrors
in their eyes?
The pieces of mirror
make their eyes look alive.
He-He wanted an audience.
He-He wanted them all
lined up watching him...
when he...
when he touched her.
When he touched her.
Touch-Touch...
Talcum powder.
There was talcum powder.
"Mrs. Leeds had traces
of talcum found
on her right inner thigh.
A complete search of the home
led to no such matching talcum
in the house."
You took your gloves off,
didn't you?
You son of a bitch.
You took your gloves off. You
touched her with your bare hand,
and then you wiped her down.
But when the gloves were off,
did you open her eyes?
Crawford.
Hey.
Are the Leedses' bodies
still at the morgue?
Yeah.
Who do we have down here
that's really good
with latent prints?
Atlanta P.D., but they've
already printed the bodies.
Not the bodies.
Tell them
to check the eyes...
Mrs. Leeds's eyes,
even her corneas.
I-I think he took
his gloves off, Jack.
I think he had to touch her.
Jesus, Will.
Gentlemen, ladies.
This is what the subject's
teeth look like.
The impressions came from
bite marks on Mrs. Leeds.
This degree
of crookedness...
plus the groove in
this central incisor...
makes his bite signature
unique.
Fuckin' shark.
Knock it off.
We're grateful for
the Bureau's involvement.
They have a great deal
of expertise in this area.
In particular,
Investigator Graham does.
Isn't that right, Jack?
Yes, sir.
Anything you want to add,
Mr. Graham?
Why don't you come on up
to the front, please?
Mrs. Leeds and Mrs. Jacobi
were the primary targets.
The others were killed just
to complete his fantasy.
I know that might be
hard to accept,
given what you saw,
but this was not random.
This wasn't
some killing frenzy.
He was never
out of control.
These attacks
were highly organized,
the women carefully chosen.
We don't know how he's
choosing them or why.
They lived
in different states,
and they never met.
But there is
some connection.
There's some common factor,
and that's the key.
Find out what that is,
and we'll save lives.
'Cause this one is gonna
go on and on...
until we get smart
or we get lucky.
- He won't stop.
- Why not?
Because it makes him God.
Would you give that up?
You asked about the dog.
Last night, a vet called us.
Leeds and his oldest boy
brought the dog in the afternoon
before they were killed.
Had a puncture wound
to its abdomen.
Vet had to put it down.
Was the dog wearing a collar
with the Leedses' address
on it?
No.
Did the Jacobis
in Birmingham have a dog?
No dog.
They found a litter box
in the basement.
Cat droppings in it. No cat.
If the cat was attacked,
the Jacobis might have
buried it.
Ask Birmingham
to check that back yard.
And tell them to use
a methane probe.
It's faster.
Yeah.
It's for you.
Crawford.
Carl, you're the light
of my life. Would it
hold up in court?
Okay. Great work.
They found a print
on Mrs. Leeds's left eye...
partial thumb.
Other than that,
there's nothing else
that I can tell you.
Thank you very much
for your time. I cannot
answer any more questions.
Will Graham.
Remember me?
Freddy Lounds.
I covered the Lecter case
for the Tattler.
Did the paperback.
Yeah, I remember.
When'd they bring you in?
What do you got?
You think the Tooth Fairy
will be even a bigger story
than Lecter?
He's already
beaten Lecter's score.
Hey, hey!
You write lying shit,
and the Tattler
is an ass wipe!
Just stay away
from me.
Get away, Lounds.
Go on.
How about an exclusive?
Sorry about that.
That guy snuck into the hospital
and took those pictures of me.
Remember? With the tubes
hanging out of me.
I know.
Forget that prick
and give yourself
some credit.
When we catch the Tooth Fairy,
that print plus his teeth
will burn him.
- You did that, Will.
- The evidence was there, Jack.
It was right there
for anybody to see.
But nobody else did.
All I'm saying is
that was very good work.
No. Good work would be
seeing it all the way through
and catching the guy.
And I can't do that.
I did what you
asked me to do.
I'm going home.
I don't even have any idea
who this guy is.
That-That stuff I just gave them
was broad strokes.
He's got no face to me.
That's what you said about
Garrett Hobbs. Remember?
And you figured him out.
No, I didn't.
You didn't?
No. I was stuck on Hobbs.
Yeah?
I had help.
From Lecter.
Yeah.
Jack, don't play games
with me, man.
Don't do it. If there's
something on your mind,
come out and say it.
I'm just saying maybe
we've got a resource
we ought to look into.
Have you been walking me
through the rest of this
just so you could ask me that?
Don't get mad at me.
I'm just doing my job.
If you know
a better shortcut,
let me know it.
If you think there's any
chance he'll talk to me,
I'll go myself.
If you tell me
you can't handle it,
God knows I'd understand that.
As a research subject, Lecter
has proven most disappointing.
He's simply impenetrable
to psychological testing.
Rorschach,
Thematic Apperception...
he folds them
into origami,
as you see.
So you can imagine the stir
your little visit is causing
among my staff, Mr. Graham.
If you'd care to share
some insights...
Dr. Chilton.
I'm sorry.
I've got a 4:17 flight
back to Atlanta.
Of course.
Tell me,
when you saw Lecter's murders...
their style, so to speak...
were you able perhaps
to reconstruct
his fantasies?
And if so,
did you jot down
any impressions?
No.
Let me be frank,
Mr. Graham.
The first
definitive analysis of Lecter
will be a publisher's wet dream.
I'd give you full credit
of course.
Oh.
Well, damn it, man,
you must have some advice.
You caught him.
What was your trick?
I let him kill me.
That's the same
atrocious aftershave
you wore in court.
I keep getting it
for Christmas.
Christmas, yes.
Did you get my card?
I got it. Thank you.
So nice of the Bureau's
crime lab to forward that.
They wouldn't give me
your home address.
Dr. Bloom sent me your article
on surgical addiction in the
Journal of Forensic Psychiatry.
- And?
- Very interesting,
even to a layman.
You say you're a layman,
but it was you
who caught me.
Wasn't it, Will?
Do you know
how you did it?
- I got lucky.
- I don't think
you believe that.
It's in the transcript.
What does it matter now?
Doesn't matter to me, Will.
I need your advice,
Dr. Lecter.
Birmingham and Atlanta.
You want to know how he's
choosing them, don't you?
I thought you'd have
some ideas. I'm asking you
to tell me what they are.
- Why should I?
- There are things
you don't have.
Research materials, maybe
even computer access. I'd
speak to the chief of staff.
Ah, yes, Dr. Chilton.
Gruesome, isn't he?
He fumbles at your head
like a freshman pulling
at a panty girdle.
If you recall, Will,
our last collaboration
ended rather messily.
You get to see
the file on this case,
and there's another reason.
I'm all ears.
I thought you might
enjoy the challenge...
find out if you're smarter
than the person
I'm looking for.
Then, by implication, you think
you're smarter than I am,
since it was you
who caught me.
No. I know I'm not
smarter than you.
- Then how did you catch me?
- You had... disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?
- You're insane.
You're very tanned, Will.
And your hands are so rough,
not like a cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion
is something a child
would select.
Has a little ship
on the bottle,
does it not?
And how is young Josh
and the lovely Molly?
They're always
in my thoughts, you know.
You will not persuade me
with appeals to my
intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you
at all. You'll either do it
or you won't.
Is that the case file?
Yes.
With photos?
Let me keep them,
and I might consider it.
No.
- Do you dream much, Will?
- Good-bye, Dr. Lecter.
You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet.
and I'll tell you
what I think.
I need one hour
and privacy.
Just like old times,
hey, Will?
This is a very shy boy,
Will.
I'd love to meet him.
Have you considered
the possibility
that he is disfigured...
or that he may believe
he is disfigured?
The mirrors.
Yes. You notice he smashes
all the mirrors
in the houses...
and not just enough
to get the pieces he wants.
Of course, those shards
in their eyes... so he can
see himself there.
That's interesting.
No, it's not interesting.
You thought of that before.
I had considered it.
What about the women?
Uh-huh.
Dead... mere puppets.
You need to see them living,
the way they caught his eye.
- That's impossible.
- Almost, not quite.
What were the yards like?
Big back yards.
Fenced, some hedges.
Why?
Because if this pilgrim
feels a special relationship
with the moon,
he might like to go outside
and look at it.
You ever seen blood
in the moonlight, Will?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, say, it would
be better to have outdoor
privacy for that sort of thing.
You think the yards
might be a factor
when he selects victims?
Oh, yes, and there will be
more of them of course...
victims.
So you'll be wanting
lots of these little
chin wags, I take it.
- I might not have time.
- I do. I have oodles.
- I need your opinion now.
- Then here's one.
You stink of fear
and that cheap lotion.
You stink of fear, Will,
but you're not a coward.
You fear me,
but still you came here.
You fear this shy boy,
yet still you seek him out.
Don't you understand, Will?
You caught me because
we are very much alike.
Without our imaginations,
we'd be like all those
other poor dullards.
Fear is the price
of our instrument,
You gettin' his face?
Yeah.
Okay, you got it?
All right, let's get
the fuck outta here.
-
You're sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
What do you think he meant
by "see them living"?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe nothing.
It's hard to separate
his bullshit,
but I'm gonna
make another pass
at the Leeds house.
Duchess, no.
Who's that?
Get 'em, Duchess.
Get 'em, Duch.
Go get 'em, Duch.
And... action.!
Charlie! How did you...
Hey!
Hey, gang.
He's a crazy man.
How is everybody doin'?
Oh, just fine.
Home from the store.
Hi, Daddy.
That's my girl.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, honey.
Billy.
Hi, Dad.
And, sweetie.
I am not ready for
my close-up, Mr. De Mille.
Well, what do you think?
Get close. Get closer.
A little closer.
I think maybe we'd better
put these kids to bed
a little early tonight.
They seem tired.
Don't you think?
Here we are
at the pool party.
What are you doin'?
Stop it. You stop it.
I'm telling my mother
on you.
Now I get my kiss.
You want a kiss?
I want a kiss...
the big, romantic kind.
Won't nobody get in
through here again.
I'll "guaran-damn-tee" it.
Why didn't he break in
down there?
It's more hidden.
Hell, that door's
got dead bolts.
Reckon he was in
too big a hurry.
No. This one doesn't hurry.
You sat right here,
didn't you?
You watched the children
bury the cat.
You're proud.
You had to sign your work.
Grandma. Grandma?
I'm sorry.
Oh, Francis.!
I've never seen a child
as dirty and disgusting
as you. Look at you.!
You're soaking wet.
Get out of my bed.!
No.!
Grandma, you're hurtin' me.
Shut up, you filthy
little beast.!
I should've put you in
an orphanage, grandson or not.
You hurting me.!
Into the bathroom.
Take off your nightshirt
and wipe yourself off.
Hurry up.!
Now give me my scissors
from the medicine chest.
Please, no.!
Take that filthy thing
in your hand and
stretch it out.
No, Grandma. Please.!
Now.!
Look down. Do you want me
to cut it off? Do you?
No, Grandma.!
I pledge you my word, Francis.
If you ever make your bed
dirty again, I'll cut it off.
You understand?
I'll be... good boy.
I'll be... good boy.
I promise.
Good morning, Will.
So nice of you
to visit again.
He carved this on a tree
near the Jacobi house...
with a buck knife.
The same one later used
on Charles Leeds.
Yes.
Yeah.
Take a walk with me.
He had
a second tool too,
a bolt cutter.
He used that
to clear his view.
But?
But I don't think that's
what he brought it for.
Too heavy, too awkward
and he had to carry it
a long way.
And what do we make
of that symbol?
Asian Studies at Langley
identified it
as a Chinese character.
It appears
on a mah-jongg piece.
It marks the Red Dragon.
Red Dragon. Correct.
This boy begins
to interest me.
Doctor, we don't know
what greater meaning
this symbol might...
Do you like my little
exercise cage, Will?
My so-called lawyer
is always nagging Dr. Chilton
for better accommodations.
I don't know which
is the greater fool.
- Perhaps if you could
offer some insight...
- A robin redbreast in a cage/
Puts all Heaven in a rage.
Ever been a redbreast, Will?
Of course you have.
I'm allowed
once a week.
Get to the point.
I think he meant to use
the bolt cutter to enter
the house, but he didn't.
Instead, he broke in
through the patio doors.
The noise woke Jacobi,
and he had to shoot him
on the stairs.
That wasn't planned.
It was sloppy,
and that's not like him.
Hmm. We mustn't judge
too harshly, Will.
It was his first time.
Have you never felt
a sudden rush of panic?
Hmm?
Yeah, that's the fear
we talked about.
It takes experience
to master it.
You sensed who I was
back when I was committing
what you call my crimes.
Yes.
You were hurt not by a fault
in your perception or instincts,
but because you failed
to act on them
until it was too late.
You could say that.
But you're wiser now.
Yes.
Imagine what you
would do, Will,
if you could
go back in time.
Put two in your head
before you could
palm that stiletto?
Very good, Will.
You know, I believe
we're makin' progress.
And that's what
our pilgrim is doing.
He is refining his methods.
He is evolving.
Oh, the case file mentioned
videos of the Leeds family.
I'd like to see those.
No. It would be obscene.
Why not?
You don't make it easy,
do you? Still,
one aims to please.
I'll call you if I think
of anything else.
Would you perhaps
like to leave me
your home number?
That's the end
of our session, Doctor.
For now.
It was only
his first time.
Already in Atlanta
he did much better.
Rest assured, my dear Will,
this one will give you
plenty of exercise.
My love to Molly
and Josh.
Go to the back of the cell,
Dr. Lecter. Face the wall.
If you turn around before you
hear the lock snap,
you'll get a dart.
Understood?
Yes, indeed.
You got ten minutes
to talk to your lawyer.
Starting now.
Thanks so much, Barney.
Hello? Dr. Lecter? I have
those documents you requested.
"Robes, Robespierre,
Robin.
Robin, call for.
Robin, fainting."
Ta-da!
"Redbreast in a cage."
Ah. "A robin redbreast in a
cage/Puts all Heaven in a rage."
Yeah, that's it.
"William Blake,
Auguries of Innocence. "
Hmm. Think you got it?
Yeah, we should have.
Um, we have some books
of Blake's paintings too.
Wanna see 'em?
Yeah, thanks.
Psychology department,
University of Chicago.
Dr. Bloom's office.
Oh, hi. This is Bob Greer at
Blaine and Edwards Publishing.
Dr. Bloom asked me to send
a copy of The Psychiatrist
and the Law to Will Graham.
His assistant was supposed
to give me the address
and phone number,
but, darn it, she never did.
Uh, see, I'm just a temp.
Linda will be in
on Monday.
Gosh, and I have
to catch FedEx
in about five minutes.
I hate to bother Dr. Bloom
about it at home, 'cause
he told Linda to send it,
and I don't want
to get her into trouble.
It's right there
in her Rolodex
or whatever.
I'll dance
at your wedding
if you read it to me.
Oh, I don't know.
I'm really not
supposed to.
Be a darling and flip that
little ol' rascal, and I won't
take up any more of your time.
Graham, comma, Will.
Oh, all right.
Just a minute.
Um, Gordon, Graham.
It doesn't give
the address of the house.
What does it have, dear?
F.B.I., 935 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Northwest, Washington, D.C.
Yeah?
Oh, and let's see.
Here it is.
P.O. Box 3680,
Marathon, Florida.
Marathon.
Yeah.
That's fine.
You're an angel.
I'm Francis Dolarhyde.
I've come for the package
of infrared.
Right. Put your back
against the door and come
forward three steps...
till you feel tile
under your feet.
And there's a stool
just on the left.
Same Mr. D. Who's head
of tech services.
Am I right?
Uh-huh.
I'm Reba McClane.
Just a second more,
I will get you
some light.
Okay. Here we go.
So, what do you need
the I.R. for?
It's for the zoo.
They want to photograph
the nocturnal animals.
That's great.
I love animals.
I gotta warn you though.
This stuff
is pretty sensitive.
It can be mean
to handle.
But I guess
I don't need
to tell you that.
Hey, Reba.
Oh, Mister D.
Whoa. I'm not interrupting
anything here, am I?
No, Ralph.
Listen, Reba, it's starting
to spritz outside. How about
I give you a lift home?
You ride a motorcycle, Ralph.
How's that gonna help me
with the rain?
Well, I thought maybe...
stop off someplace,
have ourselves
a little sundowner.
- I've already got a ride.
- That's cool. That's cool.
No "problemo."
If there's anything
I hate worse than pity,
it's fake pity...
especially from
a walking hard-on
like Ralph Mandy.
- Sorry.
- I have no pity.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I take the bus
all the time.
Mandy is a fool.
Ride with me.
For my pleasure.
You wanna come in?
I'll fix us a drink.
Maybe another time.
I will... come in.
When is the zoo project?
Maybe next week.
They'll call.
I love zoos.
In fact,
one of my earliest memories
is seeing a cougar
when I was about five.
I didn't lose my sight
till I was seven. Diphtheria.
Could you hand me
that knife?
Anyway, I've always tried
to hang on to what
that cougar looked like.
Although by now,
to tell you the truth,
what I see in my head...
is probably not the least bit
like a cougar.
It's more like a donkey
or a goat.
You know, sometimes I'm not
so sure I really saw him.
Maybe he's just something
I dreamed up.
You okay?
Uh-huh.
- You don't say much, do you?
- Um, no, I guess not.
Let's talk about something
for a minute...
and get it out
of the way, okay?
I can hear
that you've had...
some kind of
soft palate repair.
But I understand you fine
because you speak very well.
If you don't wanna
talk to me, that's cool.
But I hope that
you will because...
I know what it's like
to have people always thinking
that you're different.
Mm-hmm. Well...
that's good.
May I touch your face?
I wanna know if you're
smiling or frowning.
I wanna know whether
I should just shut up or not.
Take my word
that I'm smiling.
- I have to go.
- If I offended you,
I didn't mean to.
No.
I've been to their
house, but I don't have a sense
what the Jacobis were like.
It would help me if I could see
some of their personal effects.
Diaries, letters.
Do you have those things,
Mr. Metcalf?
Oh, I sure do. I mean,
other than one or two little
keepsakes Niles Jacobi got.
That would be Mr. Jacobi's
surviving son by his first wife?
Yeah, that's right.
As their executor, I keep all
that stuff here in the office,
along with some
of the smaller valuables,
till after probate.
But, uh, Birmingham P.D. 's
been all through it.
Could you pack those things
and ship 'em up to me?
I hate to ask.
I know it's a pain in the ass.
Ah, hell.
Probate judge is
an old golfin' buddy of mine.
Son,
just tell me you're gonna
nail that son of a bitch.
We're doing our best.
Will?
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.
Thanks.
A note hidden in Lecter's cell.
Sounds like a fan letter
mailed by the Tooth Fairy.
He wants Lecter's approval.
He's curious about you.
He's asking questions.
I've scrambled a chopper.
Does Lecter know
we have the note?
Not yet. It was found
during a routine cleanup.
They don't open his mail?
Can't. Need a warrant.
X rays only.
Where's Lecter now?
Still in the holding cage.
Can he see his cell
from there?
No.
He's been there almost half
an hour. Soon he'll start
to wonder what's wrong.
We gotta buy time, Jack.
Dr. Chilton?
Yes?
Call your building
superintendent or engineer...
whoever's in charge.
Tell them to pull the circuit
breakers on Lecter's hall.
Have the super walk down
the hall past the holding cell
carrying tools.
He'll be in a hurry,
pissed off, too busy to answer
any questions. Got it?
And don't forget.
Don't touch the note. Okay?
Graham's on his way.
Listen up! We've got a note
coming in on the fly,
possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
Number one priority.
It has to go back
to Lecter's cell...
within the hour unmarked.
We'll need Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints,
then Documents.
I'll walk it through myself.
Let's go, people.
My dear Dr. Lecter...
I wanted to tell you
I'm delighted that
you've taken an interest in me.
And when I learned
of your vast correspondence,
I don't believe
you'll tell them who I am.
Besides, what particular body
I currently occupy is trivial.
The important thing
is what I am becoming.
I know that you alone can
understand this transformation.
I have some things
I'd love to show you,
I have admired you for years
and have a complete collection
of your press notices.
Actually, I think of them
as unfair reviews.
As unfair as mine.
They do like to sling
demeaning nicknames,
don't they?
"The Tooth Fairy. "
What could be
more inappropriate?
It would shame me
for you to read that...
if I didn't know you had
suffered the same distortions
in the press.
I'm fed up with this bloody
stupid building. Every day,
something breaking.
I swear they ought to tear
the whole fuckin' place down.
How much longer
do we have?
Ten minutes max.
Instructions for answering
are probably in the section
Lecter tore out.
But I don't get it.
Why not just throw
the whole note away?
It was full of compliments.
Couldn't bear to part with them.
Now we can mash just a little.
You're so sly.
Aniline dyes and colored inks
are transparent to infrared.
These could be the tips
of "T's" here and here.
On the end, that's a "P"
or possibly an "R."
Maybe this is where
he's telling Lecter
how to answer him.
Jack, there's only one safe way
to carry on a conversation
that's one-way blind.
Publication. Wait a minute.
We know this sweetheart
reads the Tattler.
That's in his note, right?
"The Tooth Fairy..."
they made that up.
Three "T's" and an "R"
in Tattler.
So how do you communicate
through a tabloid?
You got what? News stories.
- Personals. Personals.
- Damn it.
What if the killer wants
Lecter to answer him
through the personal columns?
That could be it.
We're gonna need proofs of those pages
before the Tattler's published.
Investigator Graham
interests me.
Not your standard gumshoe,
is he?
More alert,
purposeful looking.
You should have taught him
not to meddle.
Forgive the stationary.
I chose it because it will
dissolve very quickly...
if you should have to
swallow it.
If I hear from you next time,
I might send you something wet.
I remain your most...
avid fan.
The Tattler got an ad order
signed 666.
Baltimore postmark
on the envelope.
It's set to run
this afternoon.
Chicago field office is
sending the text through now.
