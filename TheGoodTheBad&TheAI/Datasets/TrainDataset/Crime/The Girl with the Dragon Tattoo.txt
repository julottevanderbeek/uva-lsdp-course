REPORTER 1:
Will you appeal?
What is this?
The media event of the year?
Don't try to play it down,
Mikael. It won't work.
Don't try to play it up.
That won't work either.
REPORTER 2:
Mikael, can we get a quote?
Mikael, will you appeal?
Yes. I'll appeal to you, Viggo.
WOMAN 1 :
MAN 1:
MAN 2:
WOMAN 2:
MAN 3:
REPORTER :
Can I get that sandwich there?
And a black coffee.
REPORTER:
Can I get a packet of Marlboro Red
and a lighter?
Tsk. Yeah.
Where have you been?
Walking. Thinking.
Smoking?
Yeah. Just one.
TV4 called.
I told them no statement
until we've read
the judgment in its entirety.
Well, I have. Anyone else?
Everyone who wants
to see you humiliated.
Been on the phone all morning?
I'm as much to blame.
You are? You wrote it?
I read it. I ran it.
Not the same.
Our credibility isn't dead yet.
Mine is.
I'm tired.
I'm gonna go home,
crawl under the duvet
for a week.
I'll call Greger,
tell him I'm not coming home.
Thank you.
It's possible
we could wait forever.
You called her and spoke to her?
I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.
I find it's much better
if she works from home.
But you told her
I wanted to meet with her.
I've told her many times
I prefer her not to meet clients.
FRODE:
ARMANSKY:
But?
I'm concerned you won't like her.
Mm.
She's different.
In what way?
In every way.
MAN :
Lisbeth.
Mr. Dirch Frode.
How do you do?
Something wrong
with the report?
FRODE:
No, it was quite thorough.
But I'm also interested
in what's not in it.
There's nothing not in it.
Your opinion of him isn't.
I'm not paid to give my opinion.
So you don't have one?
He's clean,
in my opinion.
You mean he's hygienic?
He's who he presents himself to be.
In his business, that's an asset.
Well, there's less
in his asset column after
his conviction today.
True. He made a fool of himself.
If it happened that way.
Are you suggesting
that he was set up?
That was never part
of my assignment.
But you're right.
He did make a fool of himself
professionally.
How much of a fool did he make
of himself financially?
The judgment will just about
empty his savings.
May I go?
FRODE: Moment.
Your report is light in another area.
His personal life.
Anything you chose
not to disclose?
Nothing that
warranted inclusion.
Does that mean yes or no?
I think what Miss Salander
means, and I agree,
is that everyone has a right
to a certain amount of privacy,
even if they're being investigated.
FRODE:
Not in this case. I need
to know anything about him
I might find unsavory,
even if she doesn't.
He's had a longstanding
sexual relationship
with his co-editor of the magazine.
It wrecked his marriage but not hers.
Sometimes he performs
cunnilingus.
Not often enough, in my opinion.
No, you're right not to include that.
I know.
You needed a better attorney.
You needed your sister.
She offered.
He declined.
As she hoped.
Never a good idea.
Mixing family and business.
I would've lost anyway.
It wasn't about Mikael.
It was about Wennerström
sending a message
to the press and the FSA,
saying, "Don't ask questions."
Cheer up.
MAJOR FOR TRUMPET & STRINGS"
Dad.
Nilla, you don't have
to worry about me.
Mom's worried.
About me?
About the money.
MAN:
Good evening.
"THE CHRISTMAS WALTZ"
Nilla? What are you doing?
Nothing.
Are you serious?
I don't wanna talk about it
since I know you won't approve.
Of, um?
Nilla.
Light of Life.
Light of what?
Hello?
FRODE:
Yeah.
I'm an attorney.
I represent Henrik Vanger.
Perhaps you've heard of him?
Yeah, of course I have.
This is an awkward moment.
No, that's not exactly
what I meant.
You're referring
to your recent legal problems.
That has provided us
with much amusement.
I'm sorry?
Have him call me.
But he would love to speak to you
in person, if possible. Up north.
That's not gonna be possible.
Be so kind as to consider.
I'll call you back on this number.
Okay?
Usually when I wake up
in a cold bed it's at home.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
I'm writing a press release.
Saying?
You're taking over as publisher,
you're very sorry
for any nuisance
Mr. Wennerström was caused,
and I can't be reached for comment.
Are you giving up?
Stepping aside.
This makes me sick.
FRODE: First time in Hedestad?
MIKAEL: And the last.
FRODE:
Oh, don't say that.
It's lovely in the spring.
You said it would be lovely
in the winter.
Well, this is unseasonable.
Well, I'll be on the 4:30 train
back to Stockholm.
Unless we get snowed in.
I'm joking.
You'll be home tonight,
if that's what you wish.
VANGER:
Welcome.
Come inside.
It's warm.
MIKAEL:
How do you do?
So,
what do you know
about me?
You used to run one of the largest
industrial firms in the country.
"Used to." That's correct.
Oh, I didn't mean that.
Should I stay?
No.
My grandfather forged the tracks
that the 4:30 train
will take you home on.
We stitched this country
together.
We made the steel,
milled the lumber that
built modern Sweden.
And what do you think
our most profitable
product now is?
Fertilizer. Heh, heh.
I'm not obsessed by
the declining health
of the company.
But I am with
the settling of accounts.
And the clock is ticking.
I need your help.
I'm... Doing what?
Officially, assisting
with my memoirs.
But what you'll really be doing
is solving a mystery
by doing what you do so well.
Your recent legal mishap
notwithstanding.
You will be investigating
thieves, misers, bullies,
the most detestable collection
of people that you will ever meet.
My family.
Would you like to sit?
I could possibly clear
a place if necessary.
Did you make it?
Have you something for me?
I am on welfare,
I do not administer it.
This is not enough.

#
##
No, thank you.
VANGER:
The granddaughter
of my brother Richard.
Richard was a Nazi
of the first order,
joining the Nationalist Socialist
Freedom League when he was 17.
Isn't it interesting how
fascists always steal
the word "freedom"? Heh, heh.
Oh, the 4:30.
Yes, I know. Okay.
Anyway, Richard died a martyr
to the Nazi cause in 1940.
Missed all the real
excitement.
But not the opportunity
to regularly beat his wife,
Margareta,
and their son, Gottfried.
Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father,
was what they used to call
a good-time Charlie.
They still call them that.
Do they? Okay.
He was a charmer,
a ladies' man and a drunk.
In other words, a born salesman.
Which he did for the company,
traveling around
and taking clients out to dinner.
Well, somebody's gotta do it.
That's right.
Anyway, ahem,
he died in 1965.
Drowned, drunk,
here on the island.
His wife, Isabella, who had
been pretty much useless
as a parent before,
became even more so
after his death,
which is when I began
looking after the children.
Martin, who runs Vanger Industries,
now that I'm retired.
That's right, I Googled him.
VANGER:
And Harriet.
Ah. She was bright, curious,
a winning combination
in any person.
And beautiful.
Yeah.
Something happened to her?
Someone in the family
murdered Harriet,
and for the past 40 years,
has been trying
to drive me insane.
VANGER:
A Saturday.
Harriet was 16.
My brothers
She returned a little after 2:00.
I honestly don't remember
what I was doing
that I thought
was more important,
It was during those few minutes
that something else occurred.
and yet everything.
a man named Aronsson,
Anna herself saw her.
Or the next 40 years.
Why didn't I make time for her?
Why didn't I listen?
And she couldn't have just run away?
No. Not without being seen.
The firemen stayed out all night
All the boats were still tied up
on this side Sunday.
Believe me, I checked.
MIKAEL:
She couldn't have just fallen
and drowned?
No. The currents aren't
strong here. Anything that
falls in the water turns up.
Like her father.
His body didn't drift
more than 10 meters
when he drowned the year before.
Oh, no. Someone killed her.
Someone on the island
that day.
Someone close enough to know
what she used to give me
each year on my birthday.
Those are from her.
And the rest, from her killer.
Who knows about these?
There's me, the police,
the killer,
and now you.
VANGER:
I have spent half my life
examining the events
of a single day.
I understand your frustration,
but what you're asking me to do,
it's a waste of money.
But we haven't discussed your fee.
We don't need to.
Thank you.
I can't find something
you've been unable
to find in 40 years.
You don't know that.
You have a very keen
investigative mind.
Here's what I propose:
You come stay
on the island.
I have a nice little cottage
by the water you can use.
You study the material
I send you.
You find something I've missed
or you don't.
What you're asking me to do
is set aside my life and career for...
Think of this
as a well-deserved holiday.
A way of avoiding
all those people that you
might want to avoid right now.
As for compensation,
I'll pay you double your salary
for as many months as it takes.
Quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
Herr Vanger...
I'm not done.
I will throw in one more thing,
even though
you're a terrible negotiator.
It's something you want
more than anything else,
and it can't be bought at any price.
So let me give it to you.
Hans-Erik Wennerström.
He began his career
working for me,
and I have followed it with interest,
shall we say, ever since.
You were right about him.
You just couldn't prove it.
We're in the middle
of the worst crisis ever,
and you're writing a memoir.
You fired me. I need something to do.
You fired you.
I need you here, not the North Pole.
Mikael, you know
what this is going to look like.
Like I've been gutted.
I'm running away. I am.
Wennerström wants to see me
wave a white flag, not a red flag.
If it looks like there's a problem
between us, it'll satisfy him.
There is a problem between us.
He won't be satisfied
until he shuts us down.
You're leaving me to fight him alone.
It's four hours by train.
It's not the North Pole.
"A NEW CHANCE"
"
Hey, hey.
RECORDED VOICE:
RECORDED VOICE:
MIKAEL:
What?
Some milk?
RECORDED VOICE:
Oh, yeah. These as well.
You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
His ward.
He doesn't have a daughter.
Please.
DOCTOR:
Oh, jeez.
Hi. I'm Gunnar.
The caretaker.
Oh, hey, Gunnar. Come in.
Okay.
You want to put it in there?
Okay.
GUNNAR:
You're an author.
Well, I'm doing a biography
of Herr Vanger.
Oh.
I saw you on television.
That's unfortunate.
Bit of trouble, I guess.
No jail time though. That's good.
No.
Cost you a lot of money
though, yeah?
There.
VANGER:
The entire island is
owned by my family.
Your closest neighbor
is my brother Harald,
another Nazi,
if you can believe.
Two in the family.
Oh, yes, he's quite
detestable, to put it nicely.
But you'll probably never
see him. He's a recluse.
He was there that day?
Indeed, he was.
His daughter, Cecilia,
lives over there.
They don't speak.
Does anybody speak
to anybody on this island?
Ha, ha. Actually, Isabella,
Harriet's mother, who lives there,
she speaks to Harald,
which is one of the reasons
I don't speak to her.
Right.
Cecilia's brother, Birger,
lives over there.
MIKAEL:
Who doesn't he speak to?
VANGER:
You, probably.
But you wouldn't want him to.
He can be just as unpleasant
as Harald.
Quickly losing track
of who's who here.
Ho-ho-ho. How you'll wish
it were always so.
Soon you will know us all
only too well, with my apologies.
Now, out there, my grandnephew
Martin's house, Harriet's brother.
Who speaks to him?
I speak to him.
He runs the company now,
as I think I told you.
Oh. Someone's shooting
his dinner. Gunnar, probably.
Oh, yes, I met him earlier.
He was 19 when
Harriet disappeared.
Well, he lives over there.
And you live there.
Sorry?
Your house.
Oh. Ha. Oh, yes.
Yes, you're right.
The man who hires the detective
should always be kept
on the suspects list.
Her mother.
VANGER:
But what about the search? Please.
Please. I beg you.
MORELL:
But neither could I find the motive.
Was it spontaneous?
Was it calculated?
Did she know something
someone wished she didn't?
Was it about business?
Business? Well, she was 16.
And very bright.
Henrik told me and many others
he could easily see her
running the company one day.
She was with some friends
that day at a parade.
She told them she was
feeling unwell. She left early.
But they also told me
she kept secrets from them too.
The main thing I learned was that
teenage girls are complicated.
I have one.
Oh, then you know.
I wanted to, uh, ahem,
ask you about this.
She received that from Henrik
the Christmas before.
I've studied it more times
than I can say.
I know every page of it.
It's the last page I was curious about.
As was I.
It's a list of names, numbers
and it must have some significance.
All local phone numbers.
The first belonged
to a woman, Margot,
whose mother was Magda,
who denied knowing Harriet.
The fourth, R.L.,
belonged to Rosmarie Larsson,
an elderly woman who died
some years before.
The other three were not connected
in any way that I could find.
I reminded you of things
you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry.
I can't forget.
It's my Rebecka case.
Uh, I don't know what that is.
Every policeman has at least one
unsolved case to obsess over.
Back then we had
an Officer Torstensson.
Year after year, he kept
going back to this Rebecka case.
Taking out the files,
studying them over and over.
We were young.
We laughed at him.
And that was also
a missing-girl case?
No, no, no,
that's not why I mention it.
I'm talking about
the soul of a policeman.
MORELL:
MAN:
So how's Mr. Palmgren doing?
I heard he had a stroke
of some kind? Huh?
It's terrible.
Now, what exactly do you do
at this security company?
Make coffee, sort mail.
But not full-time.
Not even part-time consistently.
They somehow got along without
coffee or mail in July and August?
How much do you make there?
Enough.
How much is your rent?
I pay my rent.
And when was the last time
you were late?
Never.
You think that thing through your
eyebrow makes you attractive?
Here's the problem.
There's a discrepancy
between the obligation
of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and
the management of your finances.
There's no discrepancy. It was clear
I could manage my own finances.
That is not clear to me.
I'm not a child.
You are not. But you were.
And between then and now,
you were committed
to the locked ward of St. Stefan's
where you continued
to display violent aggression.
And you failed to adapt
to four foster homes,
arrested twice for intoxication,
twice for narcotics,
again for assault,
smashing a bottle into a man's face.
And it's not even that long ago.
You may have conned
Mr. Palmgren into thinking
that you have changed,
but when I'm looking at this,
not to mention the way
you're looking at me now,
I don't think you have.
So the good old
Mr. Palmgren days are over.
Starting now, you will be given
a monthly allowance.
You'll provide me with receipts
for your expenses.
If the numbers don't balance,
I assume the difference
is going to drugs.
I've taken care of myself
since I was 10.
The state has taken care of you.
Miss Salander, please,
look at me, this is important.
Since your behavior
is elaborately documented in here,
it will shock no one
if I chose an alternative
to the very lenient arrangement
I have just outlined.
Would you prefer
institutionalization?
Mikael?
MIKAEL: Yes.
I'm Liv.
Oh, hi.
We're going to the same place.
Hop in.
Oh, good, thank you.
I found him at death's door,
halfway up the hill.
I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape.
It's a climb for anyone.
I should've warned you. Come in.
MIKAEL: Thank you, Martin.
MARTIN:
Henrik says great things about you.
LIV: Mmm. Martin? Smells wonderful.
MARTIN: No. Leave your shoes on.
LIV:
What are we drinking?
MIKAEL:
What a place. Look at that view.
I used to work in
the company's petrochemical
division in Göteborg.
When it was sold,
I went with it.
A dark day.
LIV:
I live in Hong Kong, but come back
to Stockholm for family events.
And I drive up to spend
a couple of days with Martin.
It's just the moose steak she wants.
Who can blame her? It's wonderful.
Something's left open.
Do you like this wine,
or you want to try something else?
No, no, it's fine.
You're writing a book now,
Martin said.
Henrik's biography.
I love Henrik. He's fascinating.
Martin too.
Together they are
the old Sweden and the new.
Yes, they are.
You know about Harriet,
right?
You don't?
Yes, I do.
The family doesn't want
to talk about it, but it can't
be swept under the rug.
What can't?
Harriet.
We can talk about it later.
Uh... We can talk about it now.
Liv knows everything
about my crazy family.
That's why she'll never marry me.
That's one reason.
MARTIN:
I don't want to read
about that in the book.
Everything else is fine.
Harriet certainly.
You know,
everything changed after that.
Not just the family,
but the company as well.
How so?
We're not Ericsson or Nordea.
But we're still the largest
family-owned company
in the country.
At our height we had
We have half of that now.
And that downward slide
began after my sister's death.
It broke Henrik's
entrepreneurial spirit
and his heart.
Uh... You were here that day?
MARTIN: I came in later,
after the accident on the bridge,
with the 4:30 train.
I know it well.
A terrible day.
And the days after, you know?
Searching, not finding.
Even worse.
This event, Mikael, it has to have
a big part in your book.
I got a call from
social welfare.
I've been assigned
a new guardian.
Hi.
Hello.
I thought I'd come over
and say hello.
I'm Cecilia.
Oh, yes. Please, come in.
Can I get you some coffee?
No, thank you.
We are all uncomfortable
with the idea of a chronicle
of our family.
It's not about the family.
It's about Henrik and the company.
Like I said.
It's not my intention to present
a malicious portrait of anyone.
CECILIA:
Unlike the one that
landed you in court.
Unlike that one, yes.
So you're not really here to find out
what happened to Harriet.
I can't ignore such a dramatic event,
but, no, that's by no means my focus.
Those boxes that Gunnar
carted down here,
which are where, in the closet now?
Those weren't Henrik's investigation?
I wonder sometimes who's crazier,
my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.
Since we're talking about her,
since you brought her up,
what was she like?
What was Harriet like?
I'm sure Henrik has told you.
He was my age back then.
He couldn't know what was
really going on with a teenager.
You were the same age.
My sister Anita
was closer to her in age.
She knew Harriet better than anyone.
You should talk to her.
I'd love to. Where is she?
If I had to guess, London.
You don't know
where your sister lives?
I haven't seen her in years.
We never really got along.
I'm getting used to that comment.
She hates this place more than I do.
She left.
Moved to London, that was it.
You couldn't pay her to send
a Christmas card, much less visit.
I'll track her down for you.
If you do, and try talking
to her about us,
don't be surprised
if she tells you to fuck off.
MAN:
You're backed up, aren't you?
"IN YOUR ARMS AGAIN"
Hard drive at home, yeah.
Okay. That's good,
because this one's done.
BJURMAN:
And how many of those were men?
It's regulation, I have to ask
these things. It's a health matter.
Write what you want.
And why do you need
such an expensive computer?
For work.
Making coffee, sorting mail.
I should have control of my money.
And you will.
Once you learn to be sociable,
get along with people. Huh?
Can you do that?
Why don't we start
with that now, huh?
Why don't we start with me?
You do something for me,
I do something for you.
That's what normal people do.
I want you to have that computer.
Feel that.
That's gabardine.
Unzip it.
And...
And...
I like the reticence.
It's almost convincing.
"AIN'T FIT TO LIVE HERE"
MIKAEL:
Through there.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I probably should have made
an appointment.
Mm, no, it's fine. Um...
Please have a seat.
Thank you.
Mikael.
Mikael. How do you do?
How do you do?
So you're looking
for investment counseling?
Well, I would be if I had any money.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I'm writing a biography of your
Uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here.
I haven't seen him
in over 20 years.
Actually, it's a lot more
than that.
Haven't seen my sister,
haven't seen anyone
in that family.
Most of what I'm writing about
predates that,
so your recollections are valid.
I wouldn't know where to start,
if that was a question.
Well, then let me narrow it down.
I've gotten up to the 1960s,
to the event that, you know,
changed everything in Henrik's life.
Harriet.
Um, everything that I know
about that, I told to whatever
his name was.
Morell.
My recollections
were a lot better then.
I'm not really speaking
about the event itself.
I just want to get a clearer sense
of what Harriet was like.
She was very messed up.
Well, just like all us
Vanger kids, really, but...
Crazy mother.
Drunken father.
At least her father
wasn't a Nazi.
Was he abusive?
Mine?
No, hers.
Not that I ever saw,
but you could tell that
something was going on.
Some days
she'd be very withdrawn.
And then the next minute
she'd be putting on makeup
and wearing the tightest sweater
that she had to school.
And then she'd be studying
her Bible like a nun.
No Vanger was ever religious.
Can you imagine?
She was obviously
very unhappy.
What do you think happened to her?
Everyone knows what.
You don't have any thoughts
about who or why?
All that I know
is that I felt really sorry for her.
I got away when I was 18
and I never went back.
And she'd have done the same.
But she never made it to 18.
LISBETH:
MAN :
BJURMAN:
I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our
appointment, I had a lot of work.
No, no, nothing to be
concerned about.
Actually, I need another advance
on my allowance.
Can I come to your office tonight?
I don't need a pen.
What's the address?
BJURMAN:
It's me.
Lisbeth.
Come on in.
You like it?
It's nice.
It's home.
What do you need money for
this time?
Food.
How are you?
I'm so glad you decided
to come and visit.
I just want my money.
Well, let's see if we can
help you out with that.
Wait.
Is there a problem?
I just want to know,
am I going to have to do this
every time I need money to eat?
You're so cute
when you're surly.
I forgot to ask you:
You like anal sex?
O XFORD'S "LUX AETERNA"
HARRIET:
I'll drive you home.
I can get home on my own.
Are you sure?
Is it any warmer inside?
No.
I apologize if you've been
having financial problems
at the magazine
during Mikael's absence.
We'll work through them.
VANGER: Are you sure?
How long do you think
you can hang on?
Six months?
That sounds about right.
VANGER:
I used to be in the
newspaper business.
We owned six dailies
back in the '50s.
We still own one.
The , here in town.
Which I let my nephew,
Birger, run, because he
can't run anything else.
So, what would you say
to taking on a partner?
Well, we've never had
to consider it before.
We value our independence
very much.
Independence in publishing
is dependent on advertisers.
However much you have, you retain.
We don't care about content.
Excuse me.
Did I miss something?
Talking about investing
in the magazine.
I gathered that. But why?
Not out of greed, that's for sure.
I feel badly that I've taken
Mikael away from you
at the worst possible time.
But now I am convinced that
this is the right thing to do.
The moral thing.
That's one reason.
And, um...
And?
The enemies of my friends
are my enemies.
MIKAEL:
How long have you been
discussing this with them?
I haven't.
They called yesterday
and asked me to come up.
Why didn't you tell me?
You live in the woods.
I deserve to be treated
like an idiot?
I wanted to hear
what they had to say.
You would've said no
before they could.
Well, I'm saying it now.
It's a bad idea.
You heard me tell them
we had six months. I lied.
We will be out of business
in three.
But you don't know this family
like I do. They're crazy.
We're not marrying into it.
If we do this, that's exactly
what we're doing.
So you wanna say no,
let's say no.
Instead of 50 percent of something,
let's own 100 percent of nothing.
Mikael?
What?
I'm leaving this godforsaken island
in the morning.
So?
So are you coming to bed or not?
How much
do one of those cost?
Around 3000.
This is really gonna hurt.
Your call.
Millennium
MARTIN:
Millennium
Well, there's another reason.
I don't like bullies.
REPORTER:
Are you referring
to Mr. Wennerström?
I'm referring to anyone who tries
to sue his enemies into submission.
WENNERSTRÖM:
CLERK:
Three-twenty.
Shit.
WOMAN:
What general period
are you interested in?
September, 1966.
Thank you.
Is this about Harriet Vanger?
You're too young
to know about that.
EDITOR:
Everyone here grows up
knowing about her.
It's how we're taught
about strangers.
Lisbeth.
I need to pay my rent.
I need some money.
Oh, come on in.
I feel a bit badly
how we left it last time.
Me too.
Good. You're alive.
You recognize this?
I had it with me last time.
I set it here, remember?
And this snap, you see it?
It's not a snap.
It's a wide-angle
fiber-optics lens.
I thought it was going to be
another blow job,
which is disgusting enough.
But I misjudged
just how sick you are.
Okay. Here's what's
going to happen.
Pay attention.
Look at me.
Once you can sit again,
which could be a while, I admit,
we're going to go to my bank
and tell them that I alone
have access to my money.
Nod. After that you will
never contact me again.
Each month you will prepare
a report of a meeting
we will never have.
In it, you'll describe
how well I'm doing.
How "sociable" I'm becoming.
Then you will negotiate with
the court
to have my declaration
of incompetence lifted.
If you fail, this video will spread
across the internet like a virus.
Nod.
And if anything
should happen to me,
if I get run over by a car,
if you run me over with a car,
this will upload automatically.
Nod that you understand.
Ooh. Gabardine.
I'm taking the keys to this apartment
because I'll be checking on you.
If I find a girl in here with you,
whether she came of her own
free will or not...
No, not the video.
I'll kill you.
Do you doubt anything I've said?
Do you doubt what's
in the reports that have
followed me around all my life?
What do they say?
If you had to sum it up.
They say I'm insane.
No, it's okay,
you can nod because it's true.
I am insane.
Nod!
I know it's going to be hard
for you to abide by my rules.
The abstinence part most of all.
So I'm going to make it
easier for you.
Lie still.
I've never done this before.
And there will be blood.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
On my way to Skellefteå.
I can only stay a couple of hours.
What's in Skellefteå?
Bible camp.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not dangerous.
It's fine, Nilla.
Whatever you want to do is fine.
Everybody needs something.
Just as long as it's not God.
I didn't say that.
I haven't been around
enough to really know
what's going on with you.
And I apologize for that.
But I'd never want you
not to tell me something
because you think
I might not want to hear it.
That's what I'm doing.
MIKAEL:
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It was nice seeing you.
Bye-bye.
I'll see you.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Oh, don't go too hard
on the Catholics.
The what?
The article you're writing.
Oh, I'm not writing
an article about Catholics.
The Bible quotes by your desk.
HARRIET:
MORELL :
Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist.
You know that Rebecka case
you mentioned.
Of course I do. But what
has that to do with anything?
Nothing, probably.
She was decapitated.
I have to call you back.
Is it Henrik?
Yeah, we were talking.
He rubbed his arm,
then he collapsed.
Think he's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
You go. Talk to you later.
I'm sorry.
Evening.
So how is he?
Well, the good news is
he survived.
How he does now, we'll have to see.
He's in intensive care.
Right.
Oh, uh...
May I have one of those?
You want a sandwich?
Small Scotch.
Uh, sure.
Thank you.
Um, I hate to be indelicate,
but Henrik promised me something
when I agreed to do this.
Yeah, Wennerström.
I need to know what he has
on him. Now. In case, um...
In case he dies?
Well, that is indelicate.
And I apologize.
I don't know what he has
on him, if you're asking me.
And he can't tell you
in the condition he's in, so...
We also didn't discuss
who I'd report to if something
should happen to him.
Oh, well, you'd report to me,
of course.
But we both know that nothing's
going to come of this, don't we?
No. No, we don't know that.
What do you mean?
I may have found something.
You're joking.
What have you found?
The last time
I reported on something
without being absolutely sure,
I lost my life savings.
I need a research assistant.
Can you authorize that?
Yes. Do you have one
in mind?
I can find someone.
I know an excellent one.
She did the background check
on you.
The what?
Well, you don't think we can
hire just anyone
without doing
a background check.
I want to read that.
Herr Frode was kind enough
to share your report with me.
The investigator's name.
That is her name, yes?
See, I can't find any record of her,
and I'm pretty good at that.
Would it matter what her name is?
If I wanted to speak to her, yes.
It's against policy.
You sure?
Just like your sources.
You understand.
Okay. Ahem.
Here's a name for you.
My sister.
She's also my lawyer.
She'll be contacting you.
There are things in here that can
only have come from one place.
The reason you can find
no record of her is because
her records are sealed.
She's a ward of the state.
What's that gotta do with anything?
She's had a rough life.
Can we please
not make it any rougher?
Who is it?
It's Mikael Blomkvist.
Actually, I'm not really up yet.
May I come in?
Please?
Hi. You and I need to talk.
I've got us some breakf...
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you had some company.
Who do you think you are?
I'm the guy you know better
than my closest friends do.
Why don't you
put some clothes on,
get rid of your girlfriend.
We need to talk.
I'm sorry, you have to go.
Okay.
Do you need me to stay?
No.
MIKAEL: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Sorry.
It's okay.
I guess I must have alarmed you,
turning up like that.
If you touch me,
I'll more than alarm you.
That won't be necessary.
Your report,
very detailed.
But for me, it wasn't very entertaining.
It wasn't meant to be.
When I write about people,
I try to entertain the reader.
Wennerström wasn't
entertained much.
Uh, your boss, Armansky,
yeah, he tells me you only
do jobs that interest you,
so I suppose
I should be flattered.
You gonna sit down?
He also says that you're
the one he goes to when
the job is, um, sensitive.
That's the word he used,
"sensitive." I'm gonna use
"illegal,"
because that's what it was
when you hacked into my computer.
No, I'm not gonna do anything
about that. I could, but I won't.
What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna tell you a story,
and if it entertains you,
maybe you'll decide to
help me research further.
And if not, I'll do the washing up
and you'll never see me again.
Here, you should eat that.
What kind of research?
Lisbeth... Oh, can I call you Lisbeth?
I want you to help me catch
a killer of women.
I've got R.J. Rebecka Jacobsson.
I've got absolutely no idea
who the rest of these are
or how they're connected
to the death of a 16-year-old girl,
but they must be somehow.
What we've gotta do is find out who
they are, what happened to them,
