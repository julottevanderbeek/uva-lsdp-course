The recording proves Tudzharov's
relations with the drug market.
There is some mistake.
It's in here.
I know
there is a traitor in the squad.
I can here you. Where shall we meet?
I found the phone number of your rat.
It's getting hot.
I have to get away. Are you with me?
Search the homes of all boys.
As a desert let them all go
through a polygraph test.
That's Sunny's bracelet.
Do you work for the police?
- No.
No.
- No.
No.
- Yes.
He's lying.
No.
Are you into women?
Is there a special one?
No.
- He's lying.
You have to meet an informer.
You've got mail.
Internal Affairs.
You are arrested for taking a bribe.
Do you think I'm dumb.
If so, we have a problem.
The next one
after Chavdar will be Jarro.
We caught Jarro's mole.
You have to go on.
Don't tell me you are a cop.
BULGARIAN  NATIONAL  TELEVISION
What were you thinking about?
When?
- While we were making love.
It sounds strange
when you say it like that.
Should I say "while we were fucking"?
CAMERA  Production Company
I don't know, but...
- That's the expression
when you fuck someone you love.
- Have you ever loved me?
PRESENT
Yes. All the time.
And see what I get - pain only.
I'm sorry
for wanting to leave like that.
It was spontaneous.
- Rome is a fine city. I understand.
Would you go there on a honey moon?
IVAILO  ZAHARIEV
What, now?
- Talking about spontaneous.
Well, I don't know... Just now...
- When then?
I chose you among many others.
Will you make me beg?
IRENA  MILYANKOVA
Okay, I'll marry you, but...
You are beautiful
when you set conditions.
ZAHARI  BAHAROV
I've got something to do. Wait here.
Don't make me search for you.
VLADIMIR  PENEV
MIHAIL  BILALOV
Are you driving his car now?
- A precaution after the hit.
ALEXANDER  SANO
I see. You and him are getting close.
I learn from you.
- You can't get Jarro without me.
I'll catch him before you say 'yes'.
- I already accepted.
DEYAN  DONKOV
What?
- That makes your choice easier.
You are insane.
- And you are a freeloader.
You shouldn't have accepted.
You'll be charged too.
KIRIL  EFREMOV
Sex with a cop reduces the sentence.
- You confuse things.
On the contrary. I think of myself.
- You want me to tell you
how much I care about you
while he's in the bank?
Wasn't this part of your mission?
VENTSISLAV  YANKOV
You are not part of my mission.
I don't want any change between us.
I don't like today's rich men.
They have more money than wits.
Unlike you.
- I'm from the old school.
MARIAN  VALEV as The Hook
I play it safe.
- That's why I offered you
that investment portfolio.
You won't lose anything.
You are my first private banker, who
takes care of every penny of mine.
I'll think about it.
All right then. I want a deal.
I'll help you catch Jarro
but then I want to disappear.
Drive me to this shop.
I want you to look at some rings.
Good news this time.
You've caught Jarro's singer.
So there's no problem to go on.
- There's always a problem.
I don't understand.
What's this?
- When my missions over,
I'll have to take cover. I want
a guarantee for a new life in Rio.
It can be arranged.
- I mean for me and Sunny.
Sunny.

TEODORA  VASSILEVA
GEORGI  IVANOV
Tudzharov's girlfriend?
Don't say you're involved with her.
She knows I'm a cop.
She saw your text message.
Do you really sleep with her?
- It doesn't matter.
She'll ruin everything.
- She wants to help us.
I'm not listening to nonsense.
You should get away at once.
Director of Photography
ALEXANDER  STANISHEV
Sunny will testify against Jarro.
Why would she?
Pardon me! Because she loves you.
Where are you going?
- I'll think of something.
Come here, we'll find a way.
After the trial I want two tickets
and new life in Rio.
Like we were not born here.

UNDERCOVER

DIMITAR  MITOVSKI
I need to meet Vein's brother.
It's the only way to solve this.
Impose your conditions
for the meeting.
I hate negotiating with barbarians.
- I'll do it.
Please. Find a good place.
- By all means.
He wants revenge.
We have to be careful.
I go to the john with a guard.
You can meet a playground.
His kid was blown, so...
- He won't be aggressive there.
That'll do.
Popov here.
Benishev from National Security?
I know you. What is it?
Yes, I've heard about that company.
Why?
We already discussed the paid leaves.
We are not talking again.
Did Sherlok Holmes go on leave?
- He's a character from fiction.
You show some character
and you can rest for a week.
Popov, what's up?
I want to see you alone.
- Go now.
Benishev from National Security
called me.
What do those fashion models want?
- A meeting.
About Z.W.U. company.
- You don't say!
We were wrong about the protection.
- But they stopped the investigation.
Exactly. I want to find out
what's going on.
Good. Don't tell them much.
They only want to be stars.
We won't give them presents.
Man, shall we try a joint?
- The new stuff is terrific.
I hope so,
last time I coughed my lungs out.
Do you want a drag?
- I'll pass.
It'll help you for the dances.
- Maybe Simona wants a drag.
Simona doesn't.
I got such an appetite,
I'll stuff like a pig.
Who are those guys?
Times are tough,
but to share a cigarette...
Go away.
Criminal police. Documents, everyone.
Wait!
Empty your pockets.
- My wallet's in the bag.
You don't want me to do it for you.
What this?
- FNR. Forest non-tree resources.
For 6 grams of non-tree
you'll easily get 8 years.
Don't, please!
- I'm 17 and I have glaucoma.
I lost him.
- But we got the glaucoma guy.
Check the documents
of both young ladies.
What's the problem, Benishev?
- Why there should be a problem?
I wouldn't be here otherwise.
A drink?
- No, thanks. Let's talk.
All right.
What do you know about
Bulgarian-German company Z.W.U.?
Besides being a part
of Tudzharov's laundry?
Let's go like this: you do
the talking, I do the listening.
We started investigating Z.W.U.
- Yes, it's common knowledge.
Some interesting names popped out.
- What names?
Of companies close to Z.W.U.
Like some S.U.N.N.Y. -
an offshore company,
registered in Lichtenstein.
Some S.U.N.N.Y.
I expected a bigger surprise.
We really do our job.
- Does Tudzharov know that?
He will soon enough.
We started tracing a diplomat.
Each month he carries for Tudzharov
big sums to Lichtenstein.
He flies to Zurich,
then rents a car to Lichtenstein
and leaves the suitcase
with the money in a lawyer's office.
It's the local representative
of S.U.N.N.Y.
It's getting interesting. Well?
- Well... nothing more.
S.U.N.N.Y. transfers money to Z.W.U.
- ...which buy lands
and luxury property
and is clean like baby's bottom.
It means you do have a problem,
Benishev.
Are you alone?
- You are crazy!
I'm sorry.
- Don't scold me.
What if one of the guys was here?
Where is he?
He did the important job
and went to a meeting with partners.
I see.
- Look, Martin...
I want to be sure...
that you really are with me.
Jarro is dining tomorrow
with Boris Zhelev, the politician.
They have some common business
and since I'll be at the dinner...
B.Z.
Martin?
- Yes.
I can record their conversation.
- You? No way!
Why?
I'm Jarro's wife.
Nobody will suspect me.
I don't want you to get involced.
In theory Jarro is
behind Z.W.U. and S.U.N.N.Y.
And in reality?
In reality we cannot charge him
on circumstantial evidence.
So you want us to be your pals?
- No other way.
Do you know how rich Tudzharov is?
- I haven't made calculations.
His annual income from illegal
business is roughly over 100 million.
What do you need from me?
- A little help.
If we prove that S.U.N.N.Y. assets
are from illegal activity,
the authorities in Lichtenstein
will unveil bank secrecy.
You want me to prove it.
- We know little about Tudzharov.
Why then you took away Z.W.U.?
- Can we work together?
No, if it means that I have
to tear off Tudzharov's balls
for National Security
to wave them proudly.
It's a matter of interpretation.
- Your interpretation.
Mine is as follows: you tell me
all you know about him
and I arrest him.
Whatever.
It was an unofficial meeting, so...
Let's forget it.
- Fine by me.
That's your best offer so far.
Who's Milen?
- My boyfriend.
When they searched him
they found the weed!
Don't worry so much.
Everybody smokes in that yard.
Were you smoking?
- No, not even Milen.
He only does it with pals for fun.
What's going on?
Why are you crying?
If it's because of some dumb ass,
I'll break his head at once.
Her boyfriend was busted
for possession of weed.
Big amount or for personal use?
- For personal use.
A joint before going to bed?
- I had to do something.
Every time he pays the price!
- Poor soul!
Not to worry. They'll give him
Try to wait for him.
- He'll not go to jail.
It's a good place to achieve manhood.
Or womanhood.
It depends on his cell-mate.
- Stop scaring her!
Don't listen to him.
Don't be afraid.
Try to send him more parcels.
Do you remember this photo?
Where did you find it?
- Me and your father
had just returned from Libya.
Look how happy you are.
I didn't see you often, that's why.
I know what you're telling me.
That I wasn't a good mother.
I hope you forgive me some day.
Forgive you for what?
- When we left with your father
we were ambitious doctors
and dreamed of a breakthrough.
We dreamed to give you everything.
And now you wonder
whether it was worth it?
I missed too many moments with you.
I'd like to... turn back the clock.
It's all right.
- You are a good son.
You grew up alone and now you take
care of me. I don't deserve it.
Nobody deserves to be alone.
- What about you?
If there was a woman by your side,
I'd be at ease.
There is.
There is one.
- Are you in love?
I want to show you something.
What's this now?
A gift to me from your father
for your birth.
Will she like it?
- She's got everything. Keep it.
Tell her it's from me. It's different.
What are her hands?
Will this fit her?
- There's no way.
Why?
Don't you two go out?
Together?
- We do. We just do that.
What is she?
A choreographer.
She dances all day long.
Be patient, she'll like you.
If you say so.
- That's the first time
you share with me about a woman.
Thank you.
Don't tell anybody.
I won't.
Popov, you're back.
How was it at National Security?
Funny. They work on Z.W.U.
but they are in deep shit.
They need help to close the case.
- We grant help only for Christmas.
That's what I told them, but...
Come in.
I'll be with you in a minute.
But what?
- I want back the case on Tudzharov.
Talk to the Chief Secretary.
- How can I?
You go hunting together.
- I'd be ashamed to.
Every time we go close to Tudzharov,
it's a major fuck up.
Because Todorov was his singer.
- Give me one successful operation
against Tudzharov
and you'll be a TV star.
The Chief will also show good will.
- In that case you'll have it.
You've been reading for too long.
Anything unclear?
Do you charge me by the minute?
- You seem absent-minded.
Does it show?
- No. But I know you very well.
I'm thinking about Popov.
I heard he plans action again.
Why don't we offer money to him?
He doesn't care about money.
He plays honest.
Every breathing creature
has his price.
It's easier for him to humiliate
a rich man than to become one.
You know why?
Nothing in this life depends on him.
If he catches me in a tight spot, it
would be a compliment for him.
But I cannot be dependent
on an asshole
that doesn't know the difference
between billiards and golf.
How do you intend
to put pressure on him?
I've taken care already.
You'll read it in the papers.
Wait, nothing has happened yet.
- No.
We'll have drink on another occasion.
I proposed to Sunny.
I'm getting married.
Sunny.
You never told me anything.
Probably because you are not
my marriage agent.
So who killed my brother?
- I don't know.
I don't do the cops' job.
- I see.
Check who took Ventzi's districts.
You'll get the correct answer.
If you talk about Chavdar,
I took care of him.
I heard that two Serbs
interrupted his last blowjob.
But I also heard of a missile
that was aimed at my Audi.
You'll all be blown for my brother.
- I had respect for Ventzi.
Are you making passes at me?
- I'm telling the truth.
And to prove my respect for you
I offer you the heroin in Sofia.
Heroin is a dying business.
Yes, but you'll have no competition.
Peter Tudzharov develops a new
channel for smuggling cigarettes.
The master boxes arrive
from Cyprus by boat to Varna.
The goods are unloaded on the coast
and are then transported by trucks.
The trucks bring the cigarettes
to a secret depot.
Then they are transferred
to vans and are disguised.
The disguise is baby puree.
They take the cigarettes
to a small factory for baby food.
Inside the goods are redistributed
and leave directly for Germany.
Talk to me in figures.
A truck contains
The trucks are two. Do your math
for the loss of the state from taxes.
Where were the cigarettes headed for?
- Germany, as far, as we know.
What is the profit from that?
- I don't know.
But the loss of the state
from taxes is 2 million.
What happens with the cigarettes?
- I'm giving up smoking,
so my colleagues will guard them.
- Your final comment?
The Agency did its job.
That's what matters. Thank you.
Are you happy now?
- Sure.
So we'll talk to the Chief Secretary.
- I'll do what I can.
I don't know about the profit.
But the loss of the state
from taxes is 2 million.
What happens with the cigarettes?
- I'm giving up smoking,
so my colleagues will guard them.
- Your final comment?
Are you Zornitza Popova?
- I'm her mother.
She is summoned by the police.
Sign here.
Did anything happen?
- I really don't know.
Hey... are you kidnapping me?
I don't know why I conceded.
- What's that?
There is a recorder in this one.
- Is this for the dinner?
Is it still on?
- All goes according to plan.
You turn it on like this.
Take a look. Do they become me?
- Be careful.
Nothing will happen to me.
Don't put the roses in the cart.
- Where are they for?
Your room.
Beware not to kill them this time.
You should have taken cacti then.
- Can you do something right?
I've got no time to water roses.
- What are you so busy with?
I educate myself, you know.
Does education include this?
Why did you open it?
- You are summoned as a witness.
Are you involved in drugs?
- Mom, calm down.
Explain. What happened?
Some cops busted Milen with weeds.
Not me though.
Really! Let's celebrate then.
I just had a couple of drags
as an exception.
Let me smell your breath.
- Don't be ridiculous.
One day you'll probably
be on methadone program.
You're not telling the Boss, are you?
- Not this time.
The Boss is your father
and he should know.
Did you hear the news?
- What?
They acquired the case of Tudzharov?
- No, better.
You were noticed after
the operation with the cigarettes.
So?
- You are promoted! Congratulations!
What do you mean?
- Forget about Jarro now.
You'll be chief
of "Analyses and Information".
You'll be in possession
of every secret of this office.
"Analyses and Information".
Is this some joke?
Why do you think so?
They are taking from me Jarro's case!
- Don't be like that.
Your experience is appreciated.
For 20 years
I've been tracing Jarro every hour.
Is that my award?
- Finish it in one week,
then Vassil will take over.
He'll deal with Jarro.
One week. Vassil.
- Show him secret files, whatever.
And you better shave.
The hostess of the show
asked the winner:
"What's your opinion
of Bulgarian men?"
And she most earnestly declared:
"Bulgarian men are the best
in the country."
So much for fair contests.
- Ladies, would you like a digestive?
Why not?
- At the bar it'll be quicker.
I'll just leave my earrings,
my ear hurts.
They seem cheap.
Are they vintage or something?
I haven't used to them yet.
Are you happy
with your cop's promotion?
We'll see the result.
How did you arrange it?
Directly with the minister.
We owe him a favour.
You could appoint him a security
consultant when his mandate is over.
It depends on his performance.
- How's the cigarette business?
You ask too much. Why is that?
I put them in a safe place.
Give me a cigarette.
- You give me one.
You've used me long enough.
- I would give you, but haven't any.
You're all giving up smoking and
I'm the only one who doesn't smoke.
I'll smuggle a couple of stacks.
Man, there is nothing here!
- What do you mean?
Damn it!
- They've taken out the cigarettes!
What are you staring!
It didn't happen on our shift!
You have something on your mind.
Addie, you, women are fucking queer!
If it paid being with a woman,
I would be with one.
Philosophers too!
You are pissed, it's obvious.
Shall I pick you up?
Pour me "Black label".
Are you ready?
We managed perfectly.
We took out all the stacks.
While the cops find out,
Germans would have smoked them all.
Good.
Nothing more?
Are you on a diet
or do just dances keep you fit?
Workout is the best way.
As to the contest everything is fine.
- Such words scare me.
You'll have to make an effort though.
- An effort, worth how many grands?
Wait.
This is my opinion.
Your pen can only write up to 15.
Are you serious?
- The difference of 10%
is due to the deputy minister.
- Is he an elephant to eat so much?
You'll be given check-points for
reconstruction at the Turkish border.
Everyone kisses hand
for such procurement.
Boris, I never kiss hand or ass.
It's the other way round.
We eat healthy food.
- Boris likes rare meat, very spicy.
It's not recommendable.
Come on.
Everything will be ready in days.
- I don't want problems.
I'll hold you responsible.
Yana, did you boast to Sunny
with your present?
Not yet.
- We had a special occasion.
Our 10th anniversary.
Diamonds.
You should polish them regularly.
Because they blacken too.
I wonder about your choice.
Cheap trinkets give you rashes.
Sorry, I'll never put them on again.
It was a pleasure.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Good night.
May I?
- What are you doing.
You are embarrassing me with these
in front of those simpletons.
I thought they were good on me.
- How much is this junk?
Jarro... Jarro, please...
Jarro, please!
Be behind the restaurant
in 30 seconds!
You turned out to be
a little dirty whore!
Turn off the light, please.
- Sorry. I didn't know you're here.
Pretend I'm not.
- We have to talk.
When do I make an appointment?
- I don't want to here nonsense now.
You're not answering your mobile,
you don't come home...
When you're here,
you're still absent.
Shall I fill a missing person report?
The minister promoted me.
Are you happy now?
Promotion? Great.
Now we'll see each other even less.
You must be pleased.
When? Because I'm getting sick too.
They're probably fighting
because of me.
I'm not imagining.
She'll betray me for the summons.
Milen was never his favourite
and now with the weed...
Nothing in my job
is good for table conversation.
What do you want to hear?
About the rats...
About the bodies? About drugs?
I just wanted to tell you something.
First, I'm not pleased
with the promotion.
When will you stop chasing him?
I was this close to an arrest.
They took the case from me.
You are really obsessed by Jarro.
I thought when we moved...
He was one of my closest friends.
You know how he acted in the end.
I cannot forget it.
I know.
I know something else too.
It interferes with my family.
Sorry.
Good afternoon, sir.
Very good lighter.
- You can't find those any more.
Is it on sale?
Come on! At last!
I haven't tried the brandy yet.
Many happy returns!
Quiet now! The present!
I know what it is.
It'll give you light in the dark.
- It was hard to get it. It's unique!
It's either unique, or it's not.
Guess who chose it.
Alex?
Was it you Preacher ?!
Wait. wait...
Jarro!
Preacher?
- You didn't expect to see me, eh?
I'm glad to see an old friend.
- Friend...
Your trick
won't take me off your back.
Why is this hatred?
I heard you got promoted.
In the past such occasions
were celebrated.
So you arranged it.
- What? I arrange many things.
I'll chase you till I get you.
- Preacher...
Why are you taking
everything personally?
Because with you
it's always personal.
Fine, here I am. Arrest me.
You are still the same pussy
and son of a bitch.
And you are still naive, Popov!
We have mutual respect with some of
your colleagues! What do you hope for?
I hope one day
you'll find what you deserve.
Preacher...
Sorry I'm late.
Have you been waiting long?
No, I just came. I heard about
the promotion. Congratulations.
You know why I'm transferred?
- I can guess.
You are in someone's way.
- This someone has a name.
You know it.
- Look at it from the good side.
I can't see it.
"Analyses and information".
With info you can rule the world.
I'm glad you'll take my place.
You're familiar with the department.
Not exactly.
Share the secret data with me.
They're secret for a reason.
Just this one?
- There's one more.
But... we'll need more time for it.
I've got time.
Now? All right.
But I'll ask you...
Keep me in the course of things.
I ask you as a friend.
Excuse me.
My wife.
Say it quickly.
- I like it that way!
I'm listening.
- I want to remind you
of the present
for my brother's birthday.
I found something...
- I insist to choose it!
It's tonight at 8. Don't forget.
- Tonight?!
All right.
Excuse me. We can't do it today.
I'm off. We'll do it tomorrow.
Bye.
Is Sunny here?
- No.
She asked for stuff for the hall.
It's in the car.
Shall I bring it?
- Maybe I'll not see her.
Why?
- She's unavailable since last night.
Maybe she took a day off.
- Maybe.
Jarro doesn't seem worried.
Then I'll take the stuff to the club.
Dad... Hi.
You've got the right to be mad.
This with the marijuana was dumb...
I'm sorry!
I'm not in a mess all the time...
- I'm ready!
I'll call a cab.
- The cab will wait.
I'm listening.
I'll tell you later.
- Sit!
Tell me about it.
With maximum details.
Boss, you wanted to see me.
This junk there...
Put it in bags and burn it.
Have you lost something?
- Do I look like I have?
Worse. You look like someone
who fucks his boss's woman.
Man, it's not true!
Or you steal her jewels.
This is a present from Jarro.
- Where did you find it?
I found it at your place.
Such nice things happen
and you are fighting.
Here, read
while I'm in the sauna.
