Something's happened.
No! Stop! Stop, stop!
Please, stop!
Oh, God!
Please! Please!
God, no, stop...
A priest?
Did they
release his name?
No, but I made a few calls.
I still have friends
in the diocese there.
McKinney.
Father Douglas
McKinney.
You knew him?
Knew of him.
Everybody did.
He's a good man.
Youth hostels,
soup kitchens.
He even made it
to the papers
sometimes.
Look, boys,
I think it's best
if you just stay put
until we try to figure out
what the hell is going on.
Aren't you at least
gonna try and
talk them out of this?
For all we know, it could be
somebody just trying to
get away with murder here.
Aye.
Only there's
a thousand easier ways
to do that.
Trust me.
Someone's trying
to call them out.
You kill a priest,
in a church, and make it
look like it was them.
Bring them back
with a vengeance.
Someone thinks
it's really clever.
Only one problem
with this little plan.
What's that?
It worked.
#  #
#  #
#  #
#  #
#  #
#  #
#  #
#  #
?
Exactly
what do you intend to do?
Every last motherfucker
that had anything
to do with it.
As you can see,
the size of the crowd here
has increased substantially
as we have confirmed
that the body was ritualized
with pennies in the eyes.
Many remember this
as the grisly calling card
of the prolific
vigilante killers
known as the Saints,
and then simply disappeared
without a trace.
We need to keep
our heads here.
It's probably
not even them.
Course it ain't them.
It doesn't really matter,
does it?
All our skeletons
just came screaming
out of the closet.
We're fucked!
We're not fucked!
We are totally fucked!
And not just fucked.
Like elephant-dick-
pounded-in-the-ass,
no-reach-around,
jungle-fucked!
Now's not the time
to panic, green beans!
I disagree!
Now is a perfect time
to panic.
We are all accessories...
Don't fucking say it!
I'm gonna say it, all right.
You've got
a mouth on you,
Greenly.
Both of you
calm down.
Just calm down.
Shut the fuck up!
Her ETA's 10 minutes.
Thanks, Seamus.
It's game time.
How we playing this?
Feds love to pull
the divide-and-conquer
routine.
We hardline her.
Stick together on this.
Agreed?
Agreed.
We're a brick wall.
Let's rock
this bitch.

Eunice Bloom.
It's a pleasure.
Now, you have got
to be Greenly.
Smecker always said
you were the funny one.
Well, funny as in
"ha-ha," though,
not like funny as in "gay,"
'cause I'm totally not.
What we're trying
to figure out is, with all
due respect, Agent Bloom...
"Special."
Excuse me?
You see, there's a "special"
before my "agent."
If we're gonna address
each other formally,
I'd appreciate
if you popped it in there,
because it
makes me feel special.
Of course, I was hoping
we could be
a bit more personable.
In fact, I'd welcome you
to call me Eunice,
and maybe l...
Okay, Eunice.
I don't see why the fuck
the Fed is even involved.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
"Fuck"? This isn't
a "fuck" situation,
is it?
I mean, I can understand
a "goddamn" or two,
but why skip all the way...
What is the Fed's
interest in this?
Their interest, Detective,
is capturing
the men responsible
for the murders
of 22 of Boston's
finest criminals.
They could have sent anyone.
They sent me. Now,
why do you think that is?
Well, since we've already
broken the "fuck" barrier,
allow me to be blunt.
It is because
I am so fucking smart
that I make smart people feel
that they are retarded.
Motherfuckers!
Which one do you want?
Me first, man,
me first!
Bust his head!
That son of a bitch
over there!
All right!
House is closed,
motherfuckers!
Why are his hands chained?
Romeo is very fast, man.
He says the Frenchman
can't lay a hand on him.
But he can't
hit him back.
That's the bet,
He's got
to last five minutes.
BOTH:
Fifty on the Mexican.
Never fight
a Mexican, Pierre.
Pound for pound,
toughest motherfuckers
on Earth!
Attaboy!
You know why?
We like pain, Pierre.
Come on, come on,
come on!
Come on, come on!
Think about it, man.
Tabasco sauce?
What kind of fucked-up people
would even invent that shit?
Get the fuck
out of the way!
Whore.
Don't be scared, now.
Remember, I can't hit you.
I ain't gonna hit you!
Found a loophole, bitch!
I ought to be a lawyer.
Thank you!
MAN: Shit, man!
Please, stop!
Oh, God! Please!
Please! Oh, God.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
It wasn't them,
but I'm sure you boys
already knew that.
All their vics
were criminals.
Clearly not the case here.
So, it wasn't them,
which makes this
a local matter
and falls under
our jurisdiction.
So, with all due respect,
we'll see you later,
Special Agent Bloom.
"With all due respect."
Man, I hate it
when people say that,
because it is
inevitably followed by
a disrespectful remark.
Here, let me
give you an example.
With all due respect,
Detective,
this matter falls under
whatever jurisdiction
I fucking say it does.
You fucking...
Let's just...
What can you tell us
about the shooters?
"Shooter." Singular.
And I can tell you...
How shall l
put this delicately?
He's a short little fucker.
One guy.
Dwarf. Got it.
Let me show you
what I'm talking about.
Detective Greenly,
you're the victim.
David.
You can call me David.
Very well, David.
The Saints' signature stance,
Copley Plaza Hotel
eight years ago.
Two men of identical height
put Yuri Petrova on his knees
and each dropped iron
to the back of his head.
Power hath descended
forth from Thy hand.
Eyes front, David.
The position of the victim
and the angles produced
by the killers' stance
created a unique scenario.
The bullets
crisscrossed in the skull
and exited the eyes.
Here, this did not occur.
The rounds moved
on a straight trajectory
through the back
of the victim's head
and out the front,
which happens when...
One guy's holding
two guns to
the back of your head.
One guy.
But you said
he was wicked short.
The Saints
were later determined
to be 5'11" tall.
The rounds exit
Petrova's eyeballs.
Here, they came out
the lower cheek,
three, four inches
below the eyes.
That puts him at 5'7"-ish.
That's not uncommonly short.
The killer posed
as a late-night
confessor.
Once the victim
entered the booth,
the killer
had him isolated.
No escape.
Short stuff comes out
of the confessional,
kicks in the door of
the priest's chambers,
leaving a crescent-shaped
indentation,
That's wicked short.
Wicked.
I can't believe
that none of us
were consulted on this!
The disrespect!
We never would have
okayed such a thing.
A priest! It's
Are we not Catholics?
For Christ's fucking sakes!
And for what? Revenge?
There's no business
in it, Concezio.
The cops.
They can be all over us.
Forget the cops.
What about these
Saints fuckers?
These guys were long gone,
and now you're trying
to bring the devil
right back to our doorstep?
Eight years ago,
these vigilante fucks
put my father on his knees
in public.
a blood relative
and benedictator
to all of you.
You think that
I don't know
that each one of you
has been waking up
with the night sweats
over this for eight years?
These sons of bitches
prison-fucked us!
In the ass!
And then
they wiped their dicks
on our grandma's drapes!
And we have been living
in silent fear ever since.
We don't talk about it.
Rape victims seldom do.
Concezio is right.
Pretending you don't
got a problem
don't solve nothing.
Let's take a moment
and look at
the serendiculous...
Seren...
Seren... Seren...
Serendipitous.
...type situation
we find ourselves in.
There's a wicked good chance
that these Saints
are gonna show.
And this time,
they don't catch us
with our pants down.
This time,
we deal with them
proactiviously, huh?
And don't forget
Boston's finest.
With their second bite
at the apple
they've got every reason
in the world
to crank up the heat.
And as for
the Saints' doting fans,
fuck them!
Bad luck.
How would he even
recognize us?
You don't remember
the fucking sketches
on the news channel?
Shit, that's right.
Fuck's sake.
You know,
every time you see
those composites on TV
and they catch the guy,
it looks nothing like him.
But ours...
CONNOR:
Just our luck, right?
We draw
Leonardo fucking da Vinci
as a sketch artist.
And two days ago,
we looked like
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck
we cut our hair for?
Yeah, that's right.
I don't know, it seemed like
the thing to do at the time,
though, didn't it?
Maybe we should dye it.
What?
Well, they're always
dying their hair
in the movies,
like
It's covert and shit.
What color
would you dye it?
Lighter, I guess.
Do you mean blonde?
I didn't
fucking say that.
Like California
surfer boy.
It's not
what I'm saying.
Like gay, gay, gay,
faggoty blonde.
I'm fucking warning you!
"Stay gold, Ponyboy!"
I'm fucking warning you!
"Stay gold
Fuck you!
You fucking cunt!
Jesus fucking Christ!
Well, I was fucking mad!
Shit!
What kind of
fucking crazy...
I know who you are.
You guys are...
Shut it!
This is so
fucking cool, man!
I'm from Boston and
I love you guys. Shit,
everybody loves you guys.
Maybe I can get on this thing.
You know, bring some
into this.
Hey, is it true that
you guys say a prayer
before you grease somebody?
And an awesome wailing
was heard
throughout heaven.
And the terrible
hand of the Lord
struck upon the Earth.
And as Almighty God
created you,
now he calleth
you home!
Oops.
Busy signal.
Will have to
call us back.
MURPHY:
Let's have a shot
while we're waiting.
CONNOR: I think
he took a little piss.
That shit was not funny!
It just came out
me fucking nose.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thought I greased my drawers.
No.
I've got connects
all over Beantown, man.
Romeo will hook you up
like a tow truck.
No.
Why not?
We don't have to
give you fucking reasons.
Forget it.
It's because
I'm Mexican,
isn't it?
How dare you, sir,
insinuate such a thing?
The fact that
you're a greasy spic,
it's got nothing
to do with it.
Okay, I'm gonna
let you have that one,
but, look, I can do this.
This isn't
rocket surgery.
You guys find the bad guys
doing bad stuff
and you kill them, right?
Well, it's not
that simple, actually.
Yes, it is.
Suppose you're right.
I was just hoping that
we was a bit more artistic
about it, I think.
Yeah? Well, you ain't.
Now, what do you plan
on doing when you get
to US soil?
We don't really have,
you know, a succinct
plan yet, you know, per se.
Haven't really
worked it all out,
as it were.
As it were.
Not fully developed,
per se.
You two leprechaun dicks
need to chill
in the greenroom
sipping on some Pellegrino
and let your manager
handle the details.
And you'd better have
my Cub Scout badge ready.
Because if you wanna kick
Yakavetta in the nuts,
have him wake up
with a horse head
in his bed,
Romeo's got an ace
in the hole for you.
And that's all she wrote.
Everything points
in the same direction.
Get out.
Look, I have been
stonewalling the media
on this thing.
I've got half of New England
thinking the Saints
whacked the priest
and the other half
thinking they're innocent.
It's a powder keg.
And we're talking riot gear
at Celtics games here.
Now, I can clear them
of this murder
and take the piss
right out of this thing.
Now, give me one reason
why I shouldn't
take this public right now.
Walk with me, Chief.
Let's talk.
This is not good.
She's gunning
for the boys hard.
This broad trying to put
a feather in her cap
is gonna get us all locked up.
I mean, this couldn't
be going any worse.
Just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down?
You know they're gonna
throw us in the Hoag.
We put half those
deranged sex freaks
in there.
I hope you guys
like cock sandwiches,
because we'll be
eating them for breakfast,
lunch and dinner!
Now, I understand
you've got
a job to do, Chief.
But this pint-sized killer
is the only thing
that puts Yakavetta right
in the middle of this.
And if Concezio
even sniffs
that we on to him,
he puts a bullet
in Napoleon's head,
plants him at the bottom
of the ocean and walks.
Now it is imperative
that we find
this little man.
You have said some dumb shit
in your days, but that...
l... You know, that... That...
What? We're all "assuming"
Smecker didn't tell her.
"Oh, yeah, by the way,
me and three
Boston detectives
"are accessories to murder.
Pass the malt vinegar."
Smecker may have been
a lot of things,
but he was a stand-up guy.
And we took an oath.
The four of us!
Yeah!
Okay! I was
just thinking.
Well, don't do that.
You're no good at it.
Fuck you!
You're as dumb
as a fucking heel,
you know that,
you blowjob?
GREENLY: Fucking,
cocksucking,
hard-on...
Jesus Christ! Look!
We need to figure out
what we're gonna do
when the boys show
and start doing
what they do best.
Because that's when
the shit's really gonna
hit the fan!
But everyone is
assuming that the boys
are gonna turn up.
We got no way
of knowing that
for sure.
Yeah, that could
totally happen.
They could not
come back.
What dream world
did you two
just slip into?
We know the boys.
ls there any part of you
that thinks they're just
gonna let this slide?
Believe this.
They're either on their way
or they're already here.
I thought you said your
car was inconspicuous.
Yeah, well, I don't like
words with "spic"
right in the middle.
Besides, it is
where I live.
Yeah? Where's that?
Margaritaville?
Hey, I hail from
a colorful people.
Besides, you wouldn't
know style if it pitched
a tent in your ass.
ROMEO:
Ace in the hole time.
Been a lot of chatter
about Yakavetta being
in bed with the Chinese.
This here is
little Yaka's
All right,
here's the plan.
Then we skin out,
we go to Doc's
for a shot of Irish,
we're at home
in time for tacos.
That's what we do.
What?
Well, it's just
this plan...
What the fuck's wrong
with the plan?
It's...
It's genius.
I can even drive
an f-lift, man.
Got my Class D license
and everything.
That's the
fucking spirit!
I'm gonna need a gun.
BOTH: Forget it.
What the fuck, man?
I'm in on this shit.
I'm working here!
Okay.
For fuck's sake!
Here's what
you're gonna do.
You're gonna consider
yourself a fucking pledge
until we tell you different.
Can I consider myself
your girlfriend, too?
That's what you get.
ls there
a fucking problem?
It's fine.
CONNOR: I'm fucking
watching you.
You understand me?
Now, you stow that shit.
Don't you worry, Rome.
Shit like this,
it builds character.
Yeah, the character
of a little bitch.
Now, that's just
unprofessional.
So, what do you think?
I think Yakavetta
killed a good man
just to send us a message.
Well, let's send him
one right back.
? Motoring
? ...night
? ...right
? And something
that rhymes
with "light" ?
Why?
I don't know.
It's not them.
It's them.
A wise man
once told me,
"Where a man's actions
are firmly bound
to an unshakable faith,
"one's worst nightmares
become sudden,
terrifying reality."
You didn't have to
bash me in the skull!
Sorry, man, we got
a plan going here.
Technically,
I was supposed to
knock you out.
But they gave me this
faggoty little gun, see,
and the weight's just not...
Christ, that's a gun?
Why didn't you just
point it at me
and say "scram"?
Scram! Get the fuck
out of here! Now!
You got it!
Hey, guys, let's not
let this one little incident
get in the way of...
CONNOR: Shut up
and get back behind
the fucking wheel!
Jeez!
Well, at least your plan's
off to a winning start.
Go fuck yourself.
Oh, fuck.
That's heroin.
How the fuck
would you know?
Fuck you.
I know shit.
What's the
symbolism here?
Symbolism?
Yeah. What does
this symbolize?
Well, it symbolizes
a huge fuck-up.
This is a plan
that fell to pieces.
A lot of it don't make sense,
which is why it all makes
perfect sense.
MURPHY:
Christ, what the fuck's
he doing?
CONNOR: I don't know.
Hang on!
Fuck's sake.
All right, all right.
Christ, he can't
fucking see
where he's going!
Shit! Turn to
the left now!
Tell him!
Go left! Go left!
What?
That way! Go that way!
Left? Fuck!
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.
Fucking stupid plan.
It's all in the execution.
And your negative attitude
ain't helping any!
What? What the fuck?
Negative attitude?
My fucking
negative attitude?
Yeah, your
negative attitude!
You've got to
visualize
the end result!
You've got to force it
into reality! Believe!
You've got to
fucking believe!
I'm about to believe
my fist right up
your fucking ass!
You'll do what?
CONNOR: Not a believer!
That's another thing,
don't be down at me,
'cause I'm right
fucking there, man!
CONNOR:
You've got to believe!
This bitch
is fast-a-rooney.
Wait.
Wait. Wait, wait,
hold on.
Uppey-downey!
Shit!
Boys, I believe things
in our fair, little city
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!
BOTH: And shepherds
we shall be, for Thee,
my Lord, for Thee.
Power hath descended
forth from Thy hand,
that our feet
may swiftly carry out
Thy command.
So we shall flow a river
forth to Thee and teeming
with souls shall it ever be.
Ballistics
just dug it out.
A .22? You've got
to be kidding me.
That's like bringing
a knife to a gunfight.
Yeah, or like bringing
a really small gun
to a gunfight.
I don't know.
Ballistics is reading
three shooters,
and this is one of them.
I find it
hard to believe
that one of the three
most lethal individuals
on the planet
just switched over
to birdshot.
Maybe we're
reading this wrong.
Priest was
a frame job,
right?
Yeah, maybe somebody's
trying to eliminate
some competition here?
Yeah.
No, sir, it's them.
Here he comes.
Doc!
Doc!
Boys!
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Come on in here with that.
Get in quick.
Get in out of the cold.
Come on.
DOC: Jesus,
Mary and Joseph!
I saw
the news channel.
Are you boys
all right?
Sound as
an Irish pound, Doc.
ls it too late
for a shot?
The Lord told me
you'd be coming.
"Doc," he said.
"They'd be coming."
And I was to have
everything ready.
And I have.
I have everything...
It's all set.
This is our Mexican.
Nice to meet you, lad.
They call me...
Fuck! Ass!
How you doing, Fuck Ass?
I'm Romeo.
This used to be
a speakeasy
in the '40s.
I only use it
for storage now.
Holy shit.
Holy shit.
This is
so fucking cool!
Nobody knows
it's up here.
You'll be safe.
You can get in and out
the fire escape.
Know what this is?
This is our hideout.
We got a fucking
hideout, man!
What, are you fucking
five years old?
You know, Rome,
we got sticks
and blankets.
You can make
yourself a fort.
Fuck the both of you, man.
This is fucking sweet.
We even got
pinball machines, man.
#  #
#  #
#  #
#  #
Lobster dick!
Look at me!
Lobster dick!
#  #
Not this time,
you little shit.
We'll see about that,
old man.
Would somebody
please come over here
and...
Fuck!
Me up the...
Ass!
Yes! That's
what he done!
That's what
he's done
every time!
I took you down, old man,
I took you down!
Are you hungry, lad?
I sent Louie out
for some sandwiches.
I could eat.
Decent work.
Do you know
what I'm thinking would be
a nice match for the back?
That chocolate hide
with the heavy marbling
we've been trying
to get rid of
for the last six months.
We'll make a leather man
out of you yet, son.
Go to it, lad.
I can't help you
with that, lads.
But if you need
something, anything,
made out of leather,
we'd be happy
to do the job.
THUG: How many times
have I been nice to you?
How many times
do my people come here
and talk to you?
This song and dance
is over. It's over,
motherfucker!
You didn't see anything!
LOUIE: Noah!
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no!
We got to call
the  Noah!
We got to call somebody.
Noah! No.
You young guys
worry too much.
We always
bounce back.
Besides,
better the chinks
than us, right?
This is some
serious shit here!
Something amusing you,
queer bait?
No, I was just...
You should be focused
on the next step!
That shipment of H
was gonna square our books
for the next six months!
Any thoughts on that?
Yeah, I got some
thoughts on that.
I was just thinking,
not too serendipitous
for us.
You...
It's like the
Roman Empire in here.
You even got
concubines and shit.
George.
What gives here?
Oh, a little cannoli,
shrimp cocktail, huh?
I need to see the boss,
right away.
Jimmy the Gofer,
Hey, boss,
I just came by
to tell you...
Hello, can you
hear me? Over.
Copy that.
Everything's in motion.
All our guys
are gunning for
these Jesus freaks.
I figure there's no need
for me to be
on the streets no more.
So, which one of these rooms
do you want me to take, huh?
I was...
veterano.
Yakavetta's gunning for you
and hard.
Even posted a reward,
like Jesse James-style shit.
Anyway, any of his guys
that take you out
gets his palm crossed.
Two hundred
and fifty big ones.
Quarter mil for us?
"Us"? What are you
talking about, "us"?
Uncle,
why do you disrespect me
in front of my friends?
I'm disrespecting you?
A year ago
you were washing
my pots and pans.
Well,
I don't wash fucking pots
and pans anymore.
I'm a part of this Uncle.
Nephew, this is not
my first barbeque.
He's with us.
ls he?
And is my nephew here
pulling his own weight?
A lot of heart.
Gorgeous George
is running the show
right now for little Yaka.
And if anyone knows
where he is, it's that
fat, fucking ugly
I'll get it out on the wire.
Anybody hungry?
Maybe we should
stop at an IHOP or...
Shut up!
Romeo's crying.
Fucking assholes!
Shut up!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that feels good.
Somebody had their
Wheaties this morning.
Yeah, get after it, girl.
Oh, that's good.
Hey, let's keep this
professional, baby.
No offense,
but I don't need you
calling me all the time.
What the fuck!
I'll kill you,
you fucking bitch!
What the fuck
did you just say to me?
I'm sorry
I called you that.
How courteous
of you to apologize.
Courtesy is so important,
don't you agree?
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm down with that.
Good. Now sit
your fat ass down.
Where is
Concezio Yakavetta?
I don't know.
Yeah, there's a lot
you don't know, hoss.
For instance,
you're the only
New York guy, George.
Your blood just ain't
quite as blue
as the rest of them, is it?
Explains why
you ain't safely tucked away
in some ivory tower
with the rest of them bigwigs
sucking on cannoli
and cocktail shrimp right now.
That's why
you're the one he left
on the streets, George.
Like you know shit
all of a sudden.
Somebody's got to run
our legitimate businesses.
Somebody's got to be
out there making...
Someone's got to
chum the waters.
Bullshit! And I ain't saying
another fucking word to you!
Good. You can just listen.
We know Concezio
had that priest killed.
Oh! That's another thing
you don't know, I reckon.
But then
why would he tell you
that, George?
You and your boys
on the street,
y'all is bait.
Gorgeous George, huh?
Expendable George
is more like it.
By the by, you've got
a pretty nice ass
for a fat man.
A priest.
Sick fuck, huh?
So, until the Saints
get popped,
we're all lambs
to the slaughter.
Bing!
And he don't care
how many of us they wipe out
in the meantime.
What do you need me
to do, Skip?
Down the
What, everyone?
North and South?
That could
get a little dicey.
Fuck their old grudges!
Grudges have
nothing to do with it.
They're all in this!
You know I don't take sides.
I don't care, Jo Jo!
You know I don't.
You don't take sides?
Never me! Never me!
You don't take sides?
You're gonna take
my fucking side
on this, Jo Jo!
You talk to that
mick Jimmy Green.
Here we go again.
Jimmy'll tell you that!
Jimmy Green!
Jimmy Green!
I don't care if Jimmy Green
hollowed out your sister
like a Chippewa Indian!
You're gonna
get in there, Jo Jo,
and you're gonna
middle-of-the-road
this fucking thing for me,
and you're not
gonna fuck it up!
You tell them everything
that we discussed!
Even the panic room thing?
Sure.
Good. Because
that's a nice icebreaker.
They'll like that.
You know, I didn't even know
those things were real.
I thought
they made that up
for that movie.
Remember the one
with the broad and the kid?
The guys in the house?
No, the other one.
Stop fucking around!
This is serious
shit here, Jo Jo!
You tell them
we meet tomorrow night.
All right.
I'll call you with
the fucking location.
Okay.
Fucking thing.
Come on, kid.
It was a fucking...
It was
a fucking accident.
We can
work this out.
He ain't gonna do shit.
You're Italian Kid.
Help us out here.
Think it over.
I am his friend.
Fuck him and
fuck his friend.
Deal the cards!
He ain't got the balls.
What did we do?
Connor.
God! No!
Why did they use
his mug shot?
What? No.
Yeah, you remember
when he said
he was all embarrassed
because that fellow had to
hold up all his long hair
behind his head?
Aye.
That's an arm.
Hey, Rocco!
mijo.
The place is called
Tando's Tanning Salon
on Bunker Hill.
That's where
the fucking
gets his fake bake at.
European cut.
Far superior.
? Yeah! You've just been paid
So split now ?
Lovely singing voice
there, Georgie.
We'd like you to sing for us.
Can you do that for me?
Can you do that for me?
It's getting hard
to be a gentleman of
fucking leisure around here!
I want the name of
the shooter you motherfuckers
used on that priest!
What priest?
His fucking name!
I don't know who it is!
That's fucking bullshit!
It's the truth!
Concezio didn't tell nobody
what he was doing
'cause he knew
nobody would
have okayed it!
The shooter's
an independent contractor!
That's all I fucking know!
Where the fuck
is Yakavetta hiding?
Prudential Building,
Jesus Christ!
MURPHY: You meeting
someone tonight?
Yakavetta's racket chiefs.
Street guys.
Your kind of guys.
You could take a real bite
out of crime here.
And I can help you.
CONNOR:
What the fuck is that?
Nobody forgot
what you guys
did to us last time.
Everybody's hiding indoors.
They give out the location
an hour before.
My uncle's place
is closed tonight.
I got the key.
How does Mexican
work for you, George?
Do you like that?
Doesn't matter to me.
I think I just shit
my European-cut Speedos.
What's this?
GREENLY:
Rosary bead.
Found it pushed
under the carpet
near the victim.
Father McKinney wasn't
wearing a rosary,
so it's probably
been there a while.
The results
on all 864 prints
found at the scene.
All matched churchgoers
and clergy but one.
Partial on
the priest's watch
is still unidentified.
No. No, that's horseshit.
Everybody gets
printed nowadays.
They even are inking up
these snot gobblers
in kindergarten now.
It's a brick wall
anyway.
We know Napoleon
was wearing gloves.
The lab got zilch
on the lock and chain.
Even the pennies
came up clean.
I'm gonna go
powder my nose.
Man. Daddy would
knock that out like
Mike fucking Tyson.
EUNICE: Hey!
What? I didn't
say nothing.
McKinney wore his watch
on his left wrist.
Where was this found exactly?
Right here,
off his left elbow.
Just occurred to me that
priests wear the rosary
while taking confession.
She's right.
Dolly, get on the phone
and find out which wrist
he wore his rosary on.
Duffy, push that
partial through
the DMV.
David, you put it
through Interpol
just to get an ID now.
Come on, vamoose!
You took your gloves off,
didn't you, cowboy?
Now why would you go
and do a damn fool thing
like that?
GEORGE:
Just two more to go.
You guys are gonna
let me go, right?
I guess we'll just
have to wait and see,
won't we?
Jesus Christ,
this is some
embarrassing shit.
Don't worry.
We worked on a sheep farm.
Smelled way worse.
Although that is
right up there.
Yo, spicaroo.
More nachos and
Hey, and I need
a refill here, pepe.
Whoa! Easy! Jesus!
How do, David?
Hey!
"Silver Peso."
It's a Mexican joint
down by the docks.
Sent it to his enforcer,
Jo Jo Rhama.
Guess gangsters
got to eat, too, huh?
I think I'll drop in
on their little supper,
see if I can
shake things up a bit.
Need a bodyguard?
No, thank you,
Mike Tyson.
Bye, now.
Bye.
These dagos are
getting antsy, man.
I'm getting spicarooed
and pepe'd.
All right,
calm the fuck down.
You got to stick it out.
Just wait on one more.
He is not with them.
It is only the sons.
They have
a Spaniard with them.
They will
slaughter everyone.
MAN ON PHONE:
Let them.
If you kill the sons...
...the father will come.
Gentlemen.
All right.
The gang's all here.
Give me my fucking BB gun.
No, Rome.
You've earned
your stripes.
Hey, tighten it up.
So?
Where's Gorgeous?
MAN 1 : ls that George?
What the fuck is that?
It's Irish for,
"You're fucked."
bitches!
I've seen the light!
You guys have
really turned me
around on this.
I'm, like,
born again and shit!
Should we let him go?
You know what
I think we should do?
I think we should
let God decide if he
gets a second chance.
What the fuck
you doing?
What the...
No, man, come on.
Hey, what the fuck
you gonna do?
You had best be right
with your Jesus, boy.
Well! Praise be to Jesus!
Georgie.
GEORGE: Yeah?
You know
all good boys
go to heaven.
You know, that was perhaps
one of the finest examples
of spiritual guidance
I've ever had
the good fortune
to witness.
It was wonderful,
wasn't it?
CONNOR: Mysterious ways,
I tell you, mysterious ways.
You know, it's about time
one of your fucking plans...
