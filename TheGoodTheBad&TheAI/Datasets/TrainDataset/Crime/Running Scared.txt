You use language like that,

Why's he always with that Russky kid?
Don't he have no other friends?
Joey, you know, they get along. it's fine.
What do you want?

That's what l want.

He knows.

Yo, Nick. Dinner.
- Oh, shit.
Come on.

Dinner.
Can Oleg stay?
lt's already been three times this week.
l'm sure his mom would like to have him home.
lt's OK. l'm not even hungry.
l'll see you tomorrow. Go Razors.
You, go wash up. Those hands are scary.
Good night, Oleg.
Good night, Mrs Gazelle.
He's not even up there.
They turned the basement
into a sports complex again.
- How many times am l supposed to tell him?
- What do you want? They're just boys.
Dad, l won't do it again, l swear.
Don't you expect me to make book on that.
Now, go get your grandfather.
l just washed my hands.
All right.
Hey, Nick.
Razors and Blues Friday night. 1 20 yellow, pal.
No way !
lt's gonna be a death match
between Chester and Erlich!
They're going home in body bags!
Red ice!
Hey, can Oleg come?
He's never been to one game, and he's...
Not this time.
Sal could only score me a pair of tickets.
Maybe next time, though.
Go get your grandfather.
Come on, man. Make it different this time.
Get up.
Get up.
l said, get up!
What is this?
Wolfgang Puck. It's your favourite.
lt's thick crust, you damn blyad.
l cut off crust for you . It will be better.
Bring me out a Moskova.
Hey. Hey.
Come here.
Watch this.
John Wayne in The Cowboys.
l don't like cowboys.
Come on.
lt's the Duke.
Come, sit.
When l was growing up in Kishinev
we had no VHS, no DVD back then.
l remember...
l did a job for this friend of my father.
l pick-pocketed a key off this apparatchik.
The man gave me as a reward
this children's projector.
lt came with three films.
Speedy Gonzales, Tarzan Of The Apes,
John Wayne in The Cowboys.
l watched that thing a thousand times.
Anzor, it's getting cold.
l was nine years old.
l didn't know how long movies
were supposed to be.
My version of The Cowboys,
it was only 1 0 minutes long.
No John Wayne getting shot.
Because it was for kids, they left that part out.
l didn't know this...until l arrive in America
and see it on TV for the first time.
l hate it. l want my 8mm back.
Because on that one, the Duke lives.
Some things were better in the old place.
Not too many. Some things.
Let me show you from the beginning.
No, no, no. Not forward.
This part's better.
Without the Duke?
Where are you going?
You don't walk out on the Duke!
Govnyak!
She said he's always distracted
and he never finishes his work,
and she wants to get him tested.
She wants to get him tested? Tested for what?
l think maybe er...attention disorder
or something.
l'm not fucking ADD.
Hey! You don't use that word
in front of your mother.
- What's wrong with ADD?
- The other one, smartass.
He don't use that word, period.
l don't wanna be on medication.
You can't make me take it.
Don't even worry about it. There's no way in hell
anybody's gonna put you on meds, OK?
Tell that teacher to come to the rink
and watch him wax that puck.
- That's perfect concentration every time.
- That's different, Joe.
We're just trying to find out
what's going on with you .
She said some great things too.
She said that he's very bright,
that he's very creative.
You left that part out before. l like that part.
l got potential.
You taking a collection down there?
He must eat.
The little prick insults the Duke...
..he don't eat in this house.
You hear me, you little snot face?
Stay in your room!
Jerk off to your fucking Razors!
He's a growing boy.
What did l fucking say, sukka?
He has to eat, Anzor.
Please.
Who puts food on this fucking table?
Not you, blyad.
l'm the big man of this house.
When l say the little shit don't eat, he don't eat.
Anzor.
John Wayne was a faggot.
So Vicki Gilleto told me she saw you walking
hand in hand with Jeannie's daughter.
- The fat one?
Sounded like a gun.
Hey, Nick, throw me some bread.
Oh, shit, get down ! Get down !
Are you OK? You OK?
Jesus, Joe. What the hell?
Stay here. Motherfucker.
- Motherfucker! l'll kill that fucking piece of shit.
- Where are you going?
You Russian piece of shit!
Fucking cunt.
Shoot my fucking house.
l'm gonna fucking kill you .
Dad, wait!
Get back in the house.
Get back in the house!
Get back in now! Go!
Don't you move.
You piece of shit.

Where's the kid? Huh?

Who is it? ls he still in the house?
The little snotfuck ran out back.
Oleg?
Oleg? What are you trying to say?
Oleg shot you?
What are you?
A fucking idiot?
l didn't do this to myself.
The little prick would've done me too.
Look at him.
Jesus, it's a fucking miracle.
Where'd he get the fucking piece?
- Fuck should l know?
- What, it wasn't yours?
No ! No way !
l got a .357 in the safe out back.
He had some fucking snub-nose thing.
Silver. Chrome.
Bullshit! Now you tell me.
l'm not playing around.
We saw where you put the gun
but he didn't take anything.
- Not with me.
- Well, he went back, Nicky.
l didn't know. l swear l didn't know.
Come here. Listen to me. Listen to me.
That piece? That's not just any hot piece.
- Tommy used it to burn a dirty cop.
- Oh, no. Joe...
Yeah. Listen.
On top of it, that kid's out there right now.
The cops are on their way. lf they find the gun,
or they find the kid and he talks, l'm dead.
- Fuck!
- Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down. We can get to him.
- You can get to the gun before the cops do.

- Memorial.
Hey, Mila, you should go with him.

Me and Nicky are gonna go find him, OK?

We're gonna find him. Don't worry about it.
Motherfuck.

- What did you see?
- Er...

He'd been shot.
- See who did it?
-No, he was screaming in Russian.
His wife asked me to stick around for the kid.
- You don't know who shot him?
-No.
l'm gonna need to take a statement outside.
l can't have you messing up the scene.
Hey, check it out.
l don't see nothing inside.
Maybe all the way back.
Forget it. Leave it for Forensics.
Sir, l need for you to wait outside.
All right. No problem.

l need some spray shit for him!
That spray shit is a controlled substance,
ma'am, so what can l tell you?

Trust me on this one. It's always a big deal.
Stay here.

What?
lt's taken care of.
Oh. It's taken care of. Lucky us.
Don't be shy.
They make a good Mai Tai for a twat bar,
but seriously overpriced.
Two million dollars for a round of drinks.
And the pussy ain't even that hot.
Jody, l'm doin' business here.
Jody! Come on, get the fuck out of here.
Two million dollars.
Suck a dick, you prick bastard.
You don't have shit on us.
What do you think of this?
Cops never found these at the scene.
Just two dead narcs and three dead Jamaicans.
Ballistics is gonna reveal the slugs
that killed my partners
didn't come from the Jamaicans.
So there were others involved.
As for myself...erm...l was never there.
Well...
dead guys tell no tales.
Yeah. Why don't you ask your pal here?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
You blew my partner Stevie's balls off
with a .38 snub nose.
A real distinctive piece.
Stainless. Polished up like a spic's hubcap.
Now, let me take a wild guess here.
l think you gave him the gun
to dump ln the rlver
Now l'm assuming that he never
got around to lt hecause two hours ago
hls next-door nelghhour
took a slug ln the shoulder
The shooter was the guy's 1 0-year-old stepson.
Who was over at Gazelle's house
two hours earlier.
What the fuck you tryin' to do here? Huh?
You tryin' to fuckin' play us?
You're wasting your time, and this is bullshit.
Bullshit? Bullshit, huh?
This punk, Anzor Yugorsky?
He describes the gun to me in vivid detail.
Makes mention it's a snub nose
with a serious shine to it.
- The fuck is this guy talkin' about?
- He's talkin' about a fuckin' shiny gun.
Big deal. There's a thousand on the street.
lt ain't the piece.
Oh, yeah? What were you doing at the hospital
when they brought Yugorsky in ? Huh?
l flgure you were there to pull a swltch
on the slug they took out of hlm
My wife asked me to go to the hospital.
She was concerned, in a neighbourly way.
She wanted me...
All right, you know what? Enough bullshit.
l expect to find a bag...
in this locker at Down Neck Station by midnight.
lf the bag is not there one minute after,
l'm taking you all down any fuckin' way l can.
And you know l will.
Cos l got the toughest mob in the world.

Stay here.
Dad?
Don't go in there. Let's just go home.

- Nah, l'm good.
But l got my boy waiting out in the car.
- l wanna get him a burger.
- Tony, take care of that.
Yeah, Tony, get him some fries
and a strawberry shake.
Don't scare him. He don't know you're coming.
l got off the phone with lvan
about this thing with his nephew.
l told you, it's not the fuckin' piece.
Look, everybody knows the nephew
is a brain -fried reprobate.
Yeah, whatever. He's a tweaker piece of shit.
And he's cooking meth in his backyard.
lt's just a matter of time
before he blows up the neighbourhood.
We know this.
But it's a sensitive issue with me, Joe.
l'm in bed with Yugorsky on this gasoline deal.
Hey.
lt's a good deal.
- l don't wanna rock the boat.
- Oh, fuck that.
Fuck those Russian cunts. Huh?
Pop, it's the fuckin' narc
that's got his dick in our ass.
Hey.
You see, Joe, the tweaker's got it in his head
that maybe you were looking to knock him
out of the cooking business
and helped the boy out.
Made a piece available to him.
l would never use a kid to do something like that.
Never.
All right, all right, look.
I need a person to make assurance to the russky
that I'll have my entire crew in the street
out looking for that kid.
Now, in the interest of professional harmony...
..l think we all wanna get our story straight.
One hamburger and you're out of my life.
That's it.

When they find out...
..they insist l have an abortion.
l tell them no.
They send Anzor to kill me.
Anzor's not a killer.
He's not...a hard man like big Yugorsky.
He thinks...
..he thinks he's John Wayne.
Wants to do right thing.
He goes against his uncle, and tells
big man Yugorsky he will pay off my debt.
His uncle refuses...
..and tells him...
he will send others to kill me.
Set example.
So Anzor make me wife.
Big man Yugorsky can't kill his nephew's wife.
But he...tells Anzor to leave Little Odessa.
He's no longer working for Yugorsky family.
l'm gonna get you the name of a shelter.
You OK?
This ain't right, Joe.
He don't need to be put through this.
Hey, Nick, l'm proud of you .
You done good, all right?
l'm gonna head up to Community Hills.
Cops don't got the gun yet but l may have
a line on it so l'm gonna go over there.

TOMM Y: Hm.

Hey, Tee. Looking fucking good.

about finding the gun

EDELE: l'll go see. Throw me my robe.

- May l help you?
- l'm looking for Oleg.
- Oleg. You must have the wrong address.
-No. He's a ten -year-old boy.
He's pale. He never smiles.
He's my neighbour's kid.
He called me from this apartment.
Owens Park Lane, apartment 303.
Well, he must have given you
the wrong address.
Or maybe you heard wrong. There's no Oleg.
He said that he was being held against his will.
That's ridiculous. There's only my husband
and my two children inside.
- No-one else. And it's late.
- Well...
l would like to take a look inside
to satisfy my curiosity.
This is absurd.
Are you suggesting l kidnapped Oleg?
You know what? l'm gonna call the police.
l'm gonna stand here waiting for them to arrive.
When all's you gotta do is just let me in.
lf you must.
- Do you mind?
- Go right ahead.
The children 's room is on the right.
They are asleep.
Please go right in.
- Hello.
- Don't ask, it's too ridiculous.
Sorry, l'm really embarrassed.
Excuse me,
but l seriously doubt he's hiding in there.
- What's through here?
- Playroom.
Whoa.
Wow.
You guys got your own little Disneyland in here.
Well, it's all about the children.
And as you can see, there's no Oleg.
l really hope that you find him.
You hear too many stories these days.
- God only knows if it were our children.
- lf it were your children...photographs.
- Excuse me!
- Photographs.
No photographs.
lf they were your children, you would have...
at least one photograph
somewhere in this apartment.
This is ridiculous! We only moved
into this place. Everything's in storage.
Now l really must ask you to leave! l insist!
Oleg?
Oh, man. This is too much.
lt's too much.
- lt's like some kind of a lure.
- You're making a mistake.
Tell her to leave, Dez.
Ma'am, if you don't leave right now,
l'm calling the police.
Call them. Call them. And mention you've got
two abducted children in the next room.
Two children who don't appear
in any photographs in this house.
- Where is Oleg?
- How dare you suggest that we...
Oh...
Where's the boy?
Where is he?
Oh, my God. Oh...
You better pray he's not dead.
Back off, you sick fuck!
Jesus. Oh, God, help me.
Come on, come on, come on.

But definitely not evil.

They don't have what l listen to on the radio.
Yeah, what's that?
Kvasha. lt's my mother's tape from Russia.
What the fuck?
Kvassna ?
You're American, not Russian.
Why listen to that shit?
My mother said l started in her belly in Russia,
so l'm Russian.
You're not a Russian, you're an American,
cos you were born in the USA.
You're an American. An American.
Say, ''l'm an American.'' You say it.

Say, ''l'm an American.''

Don't worry about it.
We're just gonna sit tight for a while.
You know...
..l used to know this kid.
His old man was a real fucking piece of shit.
Always drunk.
Always smacking him and his mom around.
This kid, he takes his licks...
and waits this old fucking prick out.
On the morning of his 1 4th birthday,
he walks into his old man 's room
with a baseball bat.
Then he Mark McGwire's
the fucking living shit out of him.
After that, the old man,
he can't even hold a spoon without shaking.
He don't remember things too good either.
He's neutralised.
Which is a good thing.
Four more years max.
Maybe three if you get some size early on.
You just gotta hang in there.
-
LESTER: lt's more money.
Running these corporations...
Get your hands off Lester's property.
That's my property.
Stay just like that.
