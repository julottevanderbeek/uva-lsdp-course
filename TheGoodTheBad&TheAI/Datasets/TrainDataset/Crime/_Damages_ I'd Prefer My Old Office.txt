PARSONS: High Star conducted
an illegal mission at the order
During the execution of this mission,
these men lost their lives.
The men who died--
You knew them.
Are you still willing
to testify?
SANCHEZ: If it will
help my guys' families.
Who's Ellen?
SANCHEZ: No one.
BOORMAN: That lawyer, Ellen
Parsons-- We need to find a way
ERICKSON: What are
you suggesting?
Look for some mullah
that doesn't exist?
ERICKSON: Let him chase
his tail for a while!
As long as he's over there,
we're fine for now.
PARSONS: I can't drag Chris through
the fire without any resources.
HEWES: And what would you do
if you could find the resources?
HEWES: Use my
firm, my resources.
Let me help you.
I owe it to you.
left me with his baby
daughter to take care of.
I recently hired somebody

"I'd Prefer My Old Office"
MAN : And all you care about is
that 30 second sound bite in that press
MAN 2: I hear that she's the
only one with the courage to
an era where everyone
else is afraid to do so.
MICHAEL: Tanya, I need
to borrow your car.
TANYA: Oh, shit. Is it Jill?
Is the baby coming?
MICHAEL: No.
It's, uh... Not yet.
MICHAEL: Can I borrow
your car or not?
TANYA: My dad just
bought it for me.
MICHAEL: All the times
you asked me to help you.
TANYA: What's wrong?
Where are you going?
MICHAEL: Can you just
get the fucking keys?!
TANYA: You want to
know about Michael?
HUNTLEY: No. I'm working with,
uh, Michael's mom, Patty Hewes.
She hasn't heard from him in some
time, and I was hoping, uh,
maybe you could answer
some questions?
HUNTLEY: When was the last time
you were in-in touch with Michael?
TANYA: Well, he borrowed
my car a few years ago.
TANYA: He never
brought it back.
HUNTLEY: And you
reported it stolen?
TANYA: My dad did, but the
police never found it, no.
HUNTLEY: And that was the last
time you were in touch with Michael?
TANYA: We're not
exactly friends anymore.
HUNTLEY: And he didn't
tell you where he was going?
TANYA: Uh, no, and he never
returned my calls, e-mails, texts.
He just took the car
and disappeared.
HUNTLEY: Well, thank you for
your time, Ms. Greenblatt.
And I may have some
follow-up questions later.
If you, um, hear from him or-or think
of anything else, please call me.
HEWES: Maggie's
my new assistant.
HEWES: And feel free to use
any and all of our resources.
They're aware that you're
gonna be drawing funds.
PARSONS: Great.
I appreciate it, Patty.
HEWES: I-I thought
I'd put you in here.
HEWES: Just...
It's been sitting here all this time.
PARSONS: If it's okay, I...
I'd prefer my old office.
HEWES: I-I use
it for storage.
PARSONS: Well, can
I clear it out?
HEWES: If that's
what you want.
HEWES: So, when are you going
to bring in Chris Sanchez?
PARSONS: I can't.
He went back to Afghanistan.
HEWES: What? I thought you told
me he was your only witness.
I think the company
pressured him to redeploy.
HEWES: Your entire case
hinges on his testimony.
PARSONS: I figure I have
one of two choices.
I could either sit around and
wait for Chris to come back, or
I could take my chances
and file my case.
And hopefully, something
will come up in discovery.
HEWES: If the judge lets
you get to discovery.
You'll be lucky if he doesn't
dismiss the case outright.
PARSONS: What would you do?
I'm asking your advice.
I know, I know. It's my case.
I just thought I'd ask.
HEWES: You know what I'd do.
PARSONS: You'd file the case.
HEWES: If in doubt,
throw the first punch.
RAYBURN: Sanchez?
Rayburn! Look at me. Franks!
Lowry! Common motherfucker!
CARTER: You okay?
SANCHEZ: Yeah.
That shrink gave them to me.
CARTER: Anything you
want to talk about?
SANCHEZ: Before we left
on the last mission...
Lowry came to me.
He wanted to beg off.
Said it didn't feel right.
It was too last minute,
we weren't prepared.
I told him everything
would be all right.
CARTER: What happened with
those guys, Sancho-- It...
It wasn't your fault just
'cause you didn't die with 'em.
ERICKSON: There are people in this world
who see things differently than we do.
They mean well. They really do.
But they have different beliefs.
We can't change them.
We shouldn't try to.
But they can't
change us, either.
It's important to take
pride in our beliefs.
They are what sustain
us and give us purpose.
Never forget that.
You ready?
BOYS: Yes, sir.
ERICKSON: Oohrah!
Let's go to church.
PROTESTERS: Murder for money!
Murder for money!
Murder for money!
Murder for money!
Murder for money!
Murder for money!
Murder for money!
Murder for money...
Murder for money!
Murder for money!
ERICKSON: Hear that, Jack?
PROTESTORS: Murder for money!
Murder for money!
ERICKSON: Think maybe you could find a
way to get these people off my street?
SHAW: Well, I would, but there's a
little thing called the First Amendment.
ERICKSON: What's going on?
I'm taking the boys to choir practice.
SHAW: A wrongful death suit was filed
against you and High Star in federal court.
ERICKSON: What's it say?
SHAW: Three High Star
employees-- Jay Rayburn, Robert Franks
and Thomas Lowry-- Were killed during
an unauthorized operation in Afghanistan.
What do you know about it?
ERICKSON: Meet me at
the house in two hours.
PROTESTORS: Murder for money!
Murder for money!
CARTER: Put some
plastic on these guys.
SANCHEZ: All clear!
Wait a minute. It's not him.
SANCHEZ: Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!
He's not here.
Hey! Boss asked you a question!
SANCHEZ: What?
I'm not catching all that.
What'd he say?
CARTER: He's saying that they're afraid
of Nur Taraki. They hate the guy.
Okay, let's bring them all in.
SANCHEZ: A.C., no, no, no.
Come on, man, look at these
guys-- They don't know shit.
The intel was wrong. Let 'em go.
Take off the fuckin' restraints.
SHAW: The plaintiff's
attorney is Ellen Parsons.
ERICKSON: Tell me about her.
SHAW: Well, she was a hotshot
coming out of law school.
Her first job was working
for Patty Hewes.
ERICKSON: Patty who?
SHAW: Hewes.
She took down Arthur Frobisher,
handled that mess
with Louis Tobin.
ERICKSON: Oh, yeah.
SHAW: Ms. Parsons cut her teeth
on the Frobisher case, and
then she left Hewes &
Associates, went to work in the
D.A.'s office, but she
didn't stay there.
Looks like she went
out on her own.
ERICKSON: Should I
worry about her?
SHAW: No. She's just a kid.
A bleeding heart trying to
make a name for herself.
But she doesn't have
much of a case.
The brief lists a single
witness-- Christopher Sanchez.
Do you know him?
ERICKSON: Yeah.
SHAW: Is he a problem?
ERICKSON: No.
And he's working for me
right now in Afghanistan.
SHAW: Then don't give this thing
another thought. I'll get it dismissed.
ERICKSON: I'm
counting on you, Jack.
HEWES: What have you found?
HUNTLEY: I spoke to, um...
Tanya Greenblatt.
HEWES: I have no
idea who that is.
HUNTLEY: She worked with Michael
at Jill Burnham's art gallery.
HEWES: And what did
Tanya have to say?
HUNTLEY: Well, she, uh, lent Michael
her car just before he disappeared.
And I-I think she may be the last person
who saw him before he left the city.
But she hasn't heard
from him since.
HEWES: Did she know
where he was going?
HUNTLEY: No. No.
But I'm fairly certain
he went to Boston.
HEWES: Why do you say that?
HUNTLEY: Well, I went through
that list of, uh, Michael's
friends you gave me, and most
of them are away at school and
didn't really keep up with him,
so I tried the social networks.
You're not online.
I tried to "friend" you, but you don't...
you don't have a page.
HEWES: No, I don't.
HUNTLEY: You know, it's just
extraordinary, the whole
paradigm shift in the
way people relate.
I just... I really think you should...
should try it.
HEWES: Did you find anything?
HUNTLEY: Um, yeah. The...
Have you ever met a Henry Thain?
HEWES: Yeah, he and Michael were
best friends since they were 11.
HUNTLEY: Well, a couple years
back, one of Henry's old
Facebook postings read,
"M.H. appeared out of nowhere.
Needed a place to stay."
And that was right around
the time that Michael, uh,
disappeared, and...
Henry was a freshman at B.U. at the time.
HEWES: So, do you think there's a
chance that Michael is still in Boston?
HUNTLEY: Well, I-I poked Henry
to find out, but he never
responded, so I'd like to go to
Boston and talk to him face-to-face.
HEWES: I'd like to go with you.
HUNTLEY: Well, that's
not really necessary.
HEWES: It's my son
we're talking about.
Anyway, Catherine's sick.
She has a fever.
HUNTLEY: They catch everything
at that age, don't they?
HEWES: And besides, I don't
have a nanny and I... don't have
anyone I trust that I can...
leave her with.
HENRY: Dude, you're rich.
Use your credit card,
get a hotel room.
MICHAEL: I can't.
They can trace it.
I don't want anybody to find me.
HENRY: What, are you
some kind of fucking spy?
What the fuck are
you running from?
MICHAEL: No one.
Just... forget it!
HENRY: Even if my roommates agree,
the R.A.'s this gay dude
who's like the fucking Gestapo.
I'm on a shit list for
partying in my room.
MICHAEL: Fuck it.
HENRY: What?
What are you gonna do?
MICHAEL: Do you really care?
HENRY: Go back to New York.
CARTER: You wanted to see
that intel on Nur Taraki?
SANCHEZ: Who compiled this?
CARTER: Boorman sent it.
SANCHEZ: There's a hundred
different sources here.
You know how long it would
take to check all these?
CARTER: It's a fluid situation.
I doubt the Mullah's in one
place for more than a day.
SANCHEZ: I don't trust Boorman
with any of this shit.
CARTER: Why would he lie?
SANCHEZ: I got my own
contact on the ground.
CARTER: Who?
SANCHEZ: You don't know him.
Someone I used to go
to for my own intel.
CARTER: Good. Let's go.
SANCHEZ: This is a
personal relationship, A.C.
I need to go alone.
SHAW: Your Honor, Ms.
Parsons' entire case is based on
a single witness, Christopher
Sanchez, who will
supposedly testify
to an alleged event.
There is no other evidence
supporting the plaintiffs' claim.
PARSONS: When Mr.
Sanchez came forward as a witness,
he claimed that High Star was
involved in illegal activity
that directly led to the
deaths of three men.
SHAW: Then why did he go
back to work for the company?
PAWLOWSKI: Thank you, Mr. Shaw.
I'll ask the questions.
SHAW: Your Honor, Mr.
Sanchez recently redeployed to Afghanistan.
PARSONS: It's my belief that he
was coerced into redeploying.
PAWLOWSKI: And that
belief is based on what?
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez has been suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder.
He was prescribed medication
by his doctor who was later
killed under suspicious
circumstances.
SHAW: "Suspicious"?
What are you implying?
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez believes
that High Star may have been
responsible for his
doctor's death.
SHAW: Keep it up, and I'll have a
slander suit filed against you by lunch.
PARSONS: Given the
circumstances, it simply defies
logic that Mr. Sanchez would
redeploy on his own volition.
SHAW: I have his contract right
here, with his signature.
PARSONS: All I'm asking, Your
Honor, is that you not dismiss
this case until my witness has had the
opportunity to go on the record.
PAWLOWSKI: How would you suggest
that we do that? He's in Afghanistan.
PARSONS: He's working
for High Star.
They must have access to him.
SHAW: No, we don't. Mr.
Sanchez is out in the field
on a six-month contract.
His assignment requires
clandestine movement all over the country,
sometimes at a moment's notice.
PAWLOWSKI: Ms. Parsons, you're
going to have to wait.
Six months won't kill your case.
PARSONS: But it could
kill my witness.
He is in a war zone.
He could die at any time.
For all I know, the company's
already had him killed.
SHAW: Your Honor,
this is outrageous.
PAWLOWSKI: Be careful, Ms.
Parsons.
PARSONS: Can you prove
that he's alive?
SHAW: Of course we can.
PARSONS: Well, then you
must know where he is.
Why can't the company
produce him?
PAWLOWSKI: It's a good point, Mr.
Shaw.
SHAW: Your Honor...
PAWLOWSKI: Are you able
to produce him or not?
SHAW: If necessary.
PAWLOWSKI: I want to hear what Mr.
Sanchez has to say.
I'll give you 48 hours to
produce him via video-link.
SHAW: 48 hours?
I don't know that that's possible.
PAWLOWSKI: I think
you can find a way.
PARSONS: Thank you, Your Honor.
ERICKSON: The judge is ordering
me to produce Sanchez in court.
BOORMAN: Sounds like your
attorney's doing a bang-up
job getting this
thing dismissed.
Ellen Parsons is back working
out of Patty Hewes' firm.
ERICKSON: How do you know?
BOORMAN: I got her
cell phone tapped.
ERICKSON: Ellen Parsons
filed the case alone.
BOORMAN: Patty Hewes has got to
be putting her up as a front.
ERICKSON: I don't
like this lawsuit.
I think it may be time for
me to get my check book out.
BOORMAN: You're already
paying Sanchez.
ERICKSON: I'm not
talking Sanchez.
I want to offer the
families a settlement.
BOORMAN: Good idea, Howard.
ERICKSON: I never liked
that last mission.
The risk factor was
off the chart.
BOORMAN: We had a small window
of opportunity. We had to go in.
ERICKSON: The asset we
pulled out, was he worth it?
BOORMAN: Absolutely.
We're getting quality intel out of him.
ERICKSON: You still
have the guy?
BOORMAN: He's
under our control.
BOORMAN: I got you
an egg sandwich.
I think, uh...
I think you're gonna like it.
And you've been very cooperative,
so I threw in some dessert.
PARSONS: Howard Erickson called.
He wants to meet with me.
HEWES: Interesting.
PARSONS: Without his attorney.
HEWES: That's unethical.
PARSONS: Highly unethical.
HEWES: If the judge finds out,
you'll get thrown off the case.
You and Erickson
can't meet alone.
PARSONS: That's why I
want you to go for me.
HEWES: Me?
PARSONS: You'd enjoy that, right?
Sitting across from Howard Erickson.
Finding out what he's up to.
PARSONS: Come on, Patty.
It'd be fun for you.
And I would love to
get your take on him.
HEWES: I'm sure you would.
PARSONS: So, you're not
gonna do this for me?
HEWES: No reason to.
PARSONS: I can think of one.
ZAFAR MARWAT: Eat
some more, Chris.
SANCHEZ: No. Really, I'm stuffed.
It was delicious.
ZAFAR: Good Pashto.
We are very happy to have
you here, very happy.
SANCHEZ: How are
things in the province?
ZAFAR: Not very good.
There is no safety,
little food, less hope.
My only wish-- For my
grandchildren to know peace in
their lifetime, but my son-- He
believes this is not possible.
SANCHEZ: Where is Nasim?
I was hoping to see him.
ZAFAR: My son is out
driving his taxi.
SANCHEZ: Oh.
I'm sorry I missed him.
I really need to ask
him some questions.
ZAFAR: Perhaps I can help.
ERICKSON: There's nothing
to be ashamed of, Jake.
JAKE: I don't know what
you're talking about.
ERICKSON: The sheets.
I want you to know
it's perfectly normal.
You're 13 now.
I think it's time you and I
had a talk about manhood.
JAKE: Can I get the waffles?
HEWES: Waffles sound delicious.
HEWES: You don't know who I am?
ERICKSON: Oh, shoot.
I'm so sorry.
I feel like a certified ass.
Patty Hewes.
HEWES: Hello.
ERICKSON: Jake, I'd like a
word alone with Ms. Hewes.
Could you give us a minute, son?
You got your Game Boy?
JAKE: Sure.
HEWES: Thank you, Jake.
I have a son.
ERICKSON: I have four.
ERICKSON: I heard a rumor Ms.
Parsons wasn't trying this case alone.
HEWES: Actually, she is.
She has no idea I'm here.
ERICKSON: Then
why are you here?
HEWES: I have my reasons.
ERICKSON: Ms.
Parsons never got back to me.
I was hoping I could find
a way forward with her.
HEWES: A way forward?
ERICKSON: Maybe you can
carry a message for me.
I'm willing to make an offer.
HEWES: That's a lot of money.
ERICKSON: I just want to do
what's right for those families.
HEWES: Ms.
Parsons won't let you.
She's not interested
in a settlement.
She's desperate to make
a name for herself.
But she's in over her head.
If I were you...
I'd keep my money.
She'll never beat you in court.
She doesn't have a case.
ERICKSON: What is this, some
kind of negotiating ploy, or are
you angling to push Ms. Parsons out so
you can take over this case yourself?
HEWES: I have my own
cases to worry about.
ERICKSON: Look, I'm not
interested in playing games.
This is my final offer.
HEWES: This isn't my case.
I'm in no position to make a deal.
ERICKSON: Then do me a
solid and pass that along.
The offer is generous. Tell Ms.
Parsons there won't be another.
PARSONS: How did it go?
HEWES: It was smart to file the case.
He wants to settle.
He even was willing to negotiate
against himself and up the offer.
PARSONS: But you
didn't accept it.
HEWES: No, but you need to
take the offer to your clients.
PARSONS: They don't
need to know.
HEWES: That's not
exactly ethical, Ellen.
It's a substantial figure.
PARSONS: I'll think about it.
HEWES: Well, anyway, you know that
Erickson's scared now,
so just keep pusing.
PARSONS: Thanks for
going to meet with him.
I'm glad we could
help each other out.
HEWES: How's my little girl?
PARSONS: She's fine.
Don't worry.
HEWES: Well, check her
temperature every couple of
hours, and if anything goes
wrong, anything at all, her
doctor's number's on
the fridge, okay?
And make sure she
stays hydrated.
PARSONS: I'll take good care
of her while you're away.
Listen, I forgot to ask.
I'm looking after Chris's
dog while he's away.
Is it okay if I bring her over?
HEWES: Yeah, it's no problem.
PARSONS: Okay. Thanks, Patty.
HEWES: Bye.
You drive.
You do drive?
ZAFAR: I know who he is.
Mullah Nur Taraki.
Well-known in this province.
Very powerful.
SANCHEZ: I was told my men
killed his brother, and now
he's seeking revenge.
ZAFAR: Who told you this?
SANCHEZ: It's better
for you not to know.
ZAFAR: Taraki's brother was
killed, but not by your men.
He was beheaded
by a rival tribe.
Taraki knows this.
SANCHEZ: Are you sure?
ZAFAR: Listen to me, Chris.
I am your friend.
This story that you have
been told-- It's fiction.
SANCHEZ: I thought it might be.
But that's not the only
reason I came to see you.
ZAFAR: No?
SANCHEZ: I need to tell you
about the missions I led.
Your son, Nasim, helped me with
information, what... whatever I
needed to do my job.
I will always be grateful.
But what I did...
We interrogated people.
I think many of
them were innocent.
Some of them died.
I...
I didn't think of it as
torture at the time.
We-we were doing it for
the right reasons.
We were.
But... I think we did
more harm than good.
I regret it now.
You came all the way to
Afghanistan to tell us this?
SANCHEZ: I'm very sorry.
BOORMAN: I'm coming
up to get you.
Time to pray.
HUNTLEY: So you wouldn't
let Michael stay with you?
HENRY: Look, I'm gonna
be late for class.
HUNTLEY: You're not going to turn
your back on him again, are you?
HENRY: What was I supposed to
do, let him live in my dorm?
I had roommates.
HEWES: All right, Maggie.
That's fine.
HENRY: Who is that?
HEWES: And tell Girotto I need to
push back the deposition again.
I'm out of town.
HENRY: Oh, fuck.
HEWES: Hello, Henry.
How are you?
HENRY: I'm fine, Ms. Hewes.
HEWES: So, you're a junior now.
Your parents must be proud.
HENRY: I'm so sorry about
Michael, Ms. Hewes.
When he showed up,
we were in finals.
I was totally swamped.
I really wanted to
help him, but...
HEWES: Relax, Henry.
This isn't about you.
You are not in trouble.
I'm just trying to find Michael.
HUNTLEY: Any idea
where he is now?
HENRY: Last time I saw
him was a while ago.
HUNTLEY: And where
exactly was that?
HENRY: He used to hang
out across the street
from this nightclub
called Razor Fish.
HEWES: Hang out? And do what?
HENRY: Seemed like he was trying to
work his way into the scene down there.
HEWES: Where did he live?
HENRY: In his car.
HEWES: So he was homeless?
HENRY: I brought him clothes.
Even gave him money once.
I'm so sorry, Ms. Hewes.
BOORMAN: Patty Hewes came
instead of Ellen Parsons?
ERICKSON: I don't know what kind
of tag-team they got going on.
I offered 'em a shit pot full of money,
but they have no intention of settling.
No. I'm not hungry.
I'm worried about Chris Sanchez.
Who knows what he's
gonna say in court?
BOORMAN: Hmm. He doesn't have to
say anything if he doesn't appear.
Afghanistan's a
war zone, Howard.
Anything can happen.
CARTER: What did
your contact say?
SANCHEZ: Boorman's
full of shit.
We didn't kill Taraki's brother.
The fucking fatwa against
me-- All bullshit.
What are you doing, A.C.?
CARTER: Sorry, man.
Lawsuit's been filed.
There's going to be a hearing.
The company cannot
have you talking.
JUDGE PAWLOWSKI: Mr. Shaw,
we have been here for over an hour.
SHAW: I'm sorry, Your Honor.
They assured me Mr.
Sanchez would be online by now.
It may be a technical problem.
Perhaps we could reschedule?
PARSONS: They're just
stalling, Your Honor.
Either that, or my witness
is being threatened.
SANCHEZ: Can you hear me? Ellen?
PAWLOWSKI: Welcome, Mr.
Sanchez.
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez, on the
day Rayburn, Franks and Lowry
were killed, you were on a
mission for High Star Security,
is that correct?
SANCHEZ: Yes.
PARSONS: And what was the
purpose of this operation?
SANCHEZ: Our orders were to
escort kitchen equipment to a
NATO base outside Kandahar.
PARSONS: Kitchen equipment?
SANCHEZ: That's correct.
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez, in
previous conversations, do you
recall stating that you were
involved in an illegal operation?
SANCHEZ: No.
I don't ever recall saying that.
We were escorting
kitchen supplies.
PARSONS: Then how
did these men die?
SANCHEZ: We were ambushed as we
drove through the Kydar Pass.
The enemy had position
on the ridge.
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez, is
your testimony being coerced?
SHAW: Your Honor...
PAWLOWSKI: He-he...
he can answer.
Mr. Sanchez, are you
under any duress?
SANCHEZ: No, sir, not at all.
PARSONS: In previous
conversations, you told me that
you never wanted to
return to Afghanistan.
What has made you
change your mind?
SANCHEZ: My mother's sick.
I needed the money, so I
re-upped with High Star.
PARSONS: You may be 7,000 miles away, Mr.
Sanchez, but you are still under oath.
SANCHEZ: I understand.
PARSONS: Do you know the
penalties for perjury?
SANCHEZ: I'm telling the truth.
PAWLOWSKI: Do you have
anything further, Ms. Parsons?
PARSONS: No, Your Honor.
SANCHEZ: Ellen? My dog is sick.
PAWLOWSKI: What-what...?
What did he say?
PARSONS: I'm, uh...
I'm looking after his dog, Your Honor.
SANCHEZ: Can you take her to the vet?
Please, Ellen.
It's right around the
corner from my apartment.
SHAW: Your Honor,
this is absurd.
PAWLOWSKI: Mr. Sanchez, we're
on the taxpayers' dime here.
SANCHEZ: Talk to the vet.
The dog-- She was abused
by her previous owner.
PAWLOWSKI: Mr. Sanchez, this-this...
this situation is over.
Thank you very much for your
cooperation. Be safe, sir.
Wow.
At this point, Ms. Parsons,
I don't know exactly
what you want me to do.
I don't see any
grounds for a case.
CARTER: You did
the right thing.
SANCHEZ: Let him go now.
CARTER: Take him home.
CARTER: Sorry.
MICHAEL: Can you help me out?
SETH: I doubt it.
Wait, wait. See this...
This is interesting.
This guy wants a handout.
MICHAEL: Fuck off.
SETH: What happened?
You run away from home 'cause
daddy doesn't love you?
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself, bitch.
WOMAN: Come on, let's go.
MICHAEL: How much
shit do you have?
Enough. It's 40 a tab.
You got the cash?
MICHAEL: No.
Get the fuck out of here, man.
MICHAEL: I'll take all you got.
What, you gonna rob me now?
MICHAEL: No. I'm gonna pay you
for everything you've got.
And I want your suit.
You're gonna pay me with what?
MICHAEL: My car.
What am I supposed
to do with that?
MICHAEL: There's a chop
shop around the corner.
You're a smart guy.
Figure it out.
You want the car or not?
PARSONS: Hi. Uh, I signed in.
I'm Ellen Parsons.
TARA: What's wrong with her?
I'm not sure, actually.
I was just told to bring her in.
She's not mine.
TARA: Yeah, I know.
She belongs to Chris.
So, uh, you're Ellen.
I saw your name on his phone
when you called last week.
PARSONS: Oh, right.
So you're friends with Chris?
TARA: I-I thought so.
But then he dropped off the
face of the Earth and...
Is he with you now?
PARSONS: No.
We just knew each other from
high school, and he asked me
to watch Ghwarri
while he was away.
TARA: Away where?
PARSONS: Afghanistan.
TARA: He went back?
PARSONS: Look, um, I know
this is gonna sound very
strange, but I think that he may
have sent me here to talk to you.
Chris insisted that
I bring her here.
He said that her previous
owner abused her.
Do you know anything about that?
TARA: All I know is, Chris
rescued her from some
asshole he was going
after over there.
PARSONS: What do you
mean he was going after?
CONWAY: Um, I don't know.
He didn't really explain.
PARSONS: I'm just asking because he
wasn't supposed to be going after anyone.
He was just there to
provide security.
CONWAY: I'm sorry I can't help.
I guess if Chris had wanted you
to know something, he would
have told you himself.
MICHAEL: Hey, I heard
you're looking to buy.
SETH: You heard wrong.
MICHAEL: You look familiar.
Do I know you?
SETH: I've never seen you
before, and I'm not interested.
MICHAEL: My mistake.
WOMAN: Come on, I want some.
SETH: How much?
MICHAEL: $80 a hit.
SETH: I can get it for $40.
MICHAEL: Not this shit.
WOMAN: Don't be such
a cheap bastard.
SETH: Fuck it. Give me 20 tabs.
MICHAEL: You won't be sorry.
WOMAN: You should
party with us.
SETH: Where are you going?
MICHAEL: This was fun,
but I got to go.
BIG RAY: Hey, guys,
we're closed.
And no, you can't
use the bathroom.
HUNTLEY: Do I look
like I need to pee?
Do you recognize him?
BIG RAY: Holy shit. That dude?
What the fuck ever
happened to him?
HUNTLEY: That's what
we're trying to find out.
BIG RAY: You a cop?
HUNTLEY: Sort of.
So what can you
tell me about him?
BIG RAY: He used to hang out across
the street. The kid was an asshole.
HEWES: He's my son.
BIG RAY: Oh, I'm sorry.
I can see that now.
You look alike.
HEWES: Why was he an asshole?
BIG RAY: He started
slinging dope.
HEWES: So...
He was selling drugs?
BIG RAY: Yeah.
HUNTLEY: Any of the people he
was running with still around?
BIG RAY: The dude
didn't run with anyone.
He was a loner.
Pissed off a lot of people.
The wrong people.
Then one day he disappeared.
HEWES: Thank you for driving.
HUNTLEY: I've seen this kind of
thing before, and I-- I think
you should be prepared
for, uh, anything.
HEWES: You-you think
Michael's dead?
HUNTLEY: No, I'm just saying
that you should be prepared.
PARSONS: Hi.
HEWES: Hi.
PARSONS: Welcome back.
HEWES: Thanks.
PARSONS: Catherine's
doing a lot better.
Her fever broke and her
temperature's down.
HEWES: Oh, good.
PARSONS: We had a lovely time.
Read all her favorite
books twice.
She's very sweet.
HEWES: Yes, she is.
PARSONS: Did you find Michael?
HEWES: No.
PARSONS: I'm sorry.
HEWES: So how's
your case going?
What does your witness
say at the hearing?
PARSONS: Well, um,
they got him to lie.
He was trying to
tell me something.
I think they were going after
somebody over there, but I
haven't figured out
what he meant yet.
I've been lying to myself.
I'm stuck.
I can't win this case
without you, Patty.
I want more than just
the firm's resources.
HEWES: You want the benefit of
my experience and advice, so
you can make a name for yourself
and go out on your own.
PARSONS: Why
wouldn't I want that?
HEWES: All you
needed to do was ask.
SANCHEZ: What the
fuck are you doing?
I told them what you wanted!
I told them what you fucking wanted!
- What you fucking wanted!
- We can't let you go back to the U.S. man.
This is about national
security, and you know it.
Back the fuck up.
SANCHEZ: A.C.
Don't do this to me!
Fuck! Fuck!
HIGH STAR CONTRACTOR:
You're free to go.
MAN :
Thank God for Patty...
MICHAEL: Getting away from you is the best
thing that could have happened to me.
People either leave
you or they die.
