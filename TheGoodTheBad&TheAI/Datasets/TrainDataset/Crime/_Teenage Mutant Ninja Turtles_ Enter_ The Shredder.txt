APRIL: Raphael?
Ease off, April.
We had
a rough night.
I'm not doing a thing
till we eat
some serious breakfast.
And we don't eat
until we practice.
Michelangelo,
don't lose
your patience.
I'd say you just got
smoked, Michelangelo.
Indeed, Michelangelo
has much
to learn
about patience.
Yeah, you got to learn
to keep cool
like the rest of us.
Who wants
corn flakes?
I'm having
raisin bran.
Choco puffs
for me.
You wouldn't have any,
uh, real food, would you?
Of course.
Sushi?
I guess I can hold out
until we get
up to the street.
Are we going
somewhere?
Don't you remember
that big compound
that was under the ninja's
headquarters?
That big technodrome
thingamajig.
We've got
to check it out.
It's my only hope
of getting a story
out of all of this
craziness.
Funny, we don't
get much rain
here in
the sewers.
It's not rain.
It's water from
last night's flood.
Come on, we must be
almost there.
It should be right...
Here?
You know,
a hot dog stand
would clean up
in a place like this.
I don't get it.
It's got to be here.
See? There's
the foundation
of the building
that flooded.
Where could a vast subterranean
compound go down here?
That-a-way.
What a story!
Come on, we've
gotta follow it.
Wait. We must tell
master splinter about this.
I don't believe it.
My mighty
foot soldiers beaten
by a bunch of turtles?
And mutant turtles
at that.
Great! Terrific!
We're on the run,
and that idiot
wants to chitchat.
Well, what is it?
Ah, saki,
my old friend.
I told you,
call me the shredder.
You wouldn't be
shredding anything
if it weren't
for me.
I have given you vast
technical knowledge--
But you have not
fulfilled
your half
of the bargain.
My legions are waiting
in dimension x
to storm into this world
and crush it.
All I lack is a body,
a body which
you have failed
to provide for me.
Non of us is safe
as long as hamato yoshi
and his turtles
roam the sewers.
Heh. With the body
I designed,
no force on earth
could stop me.
Including myself!
That's why I don't
trust you, krang?
And if I gave you
a means of defeating
your enemies--
Then would you
trust me?
Possibly.
But first tell me
how to defeat
the turtles.
You were the one
who tried
to destroy yoshi
with that mutagen.
But instead,
he gained the powers
of the rats.
But suppose yoshi
had been near
a more powerful animal.
Mutate my own people.
The possibilities
are endless.
All I need
are animals.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Killers!
That's quite a brain
you've got, krang.
Of course it is.
It's all I've got.
You saw
the ninja's leader
in that underground
compound last night?
Yes,
master splinter.
And now the compound
has vanished
without a trace.
I fear my ancient enemy
oroku saki still lives.
And I must join you
in the search search
for this technodrome.
That isn't a job for us.
It's a job for
the department of sewers.
Oroku saki
is the most cunning
and dangerous man
I know,
and he is a ninja
of the first rank.
I'll check
the news room.
Maybe there's been some word
on just where
the technodrome went.
Quickly. Our adversary
already has
a headstart on us.
Headstart?
We're gonna need sonar
to find this geek.
Relax, Raphael,
we've got splinter
leading us now.
Yeah, splinter
will find him,
just like
sniffing out a rat.
Uh, heh, a weasel.
Oh, still no sign
of the technodrome.
Where's Tarzan
when we need him?
Check this out.
Whoa!
This way, I believe.
That rock
is freshly drilled.
Look at the size of
those tank treads!
That dude's driving
shea stadium around
under the city.
Ha ha ha!
This could put
a serious crimp
in our plans.
Head upward, my sons.
Find some way
around all this.
I'll try to get
through somehow.
Through that?
Oh, we rats can burrow
through anything.
I need volunteers.
Aw, no, no way.
Not me. Uh-uh.
Yeah, we don't volunteer
for nothin'.
I need 2 of you
for an experiment.
Ah, forget it.
It will give you strength
and powers undreamed of.
So what?
It will make you mightier
than a dozen mortal men.
Yeah?
Big hairy deal.
It will enable you
to get even
with the 4 turtles
who so recently
humiliated you.
Where do I sign?
I'll do it! Yeah!
Ah, but I only need
Just sit.
I wish I'd brought
some comics.
Uhh? What you doing
to us, man?
Just relax.
What do you need
them animals for?
It's all part
of the experiment.
Are you sure
this is gonna give us
all them, uh, powers
your promised us, man?
Absolutely.
Of course, you may
have a little trouble
getting a date
on Saturday night.
Donatello,
you sure this is
getting us anywhere?
Of course. Every tunnel
leads somewhere.
You picked
a heck of a time
to become
a philosopher.
Now, everybody
be quiet.
We don't want
to make a disturbance.
I got a feelin'
we're not in Kansas
anymore, Uncle Toto.
Come on!
We've got to get
out of here.
And I thought
the sewers were bad.
Now that's what I call
a serious pizza.
Channel 6?
Isn't that the station
where April works?
been gone, April.
And what do you
bring me? Zip!
Vern,
listen to me.
I'm on to
something big.
Save it. Against
all better judgment,
I'm gonna give you
another chance.
Somebody robbed the zoo
The police report's
in the wire room.
A zoo robbery?
Aw, come on.
Now, April.
I get yelled at,
I get scooped
on my story,
I nearly get fired.
All on account
of those turtles.
Yo, sister.
What's the haps?
Give me a break, guys.
We had to disguise
ourselves somehow.
APRIL: Try to get serious
for a moment.
I'm on a story could lead us
straight to the technodrome.
a rhino and warthog
were stolen
from the central park zoo.
A rhino
and a warthog
are gonna lead us
to the technodrome?
They were stolen
by a couple of robots
who dragged them
underground.
Robots?
Well, come on.
Let's boogaloo.
There must be
some way inside.
April,
wait here for us.
But--
if this hole
caves in,
we'll can dig
our way out.
You can't.
Yeah. We know how
to handle ourselves
in the sew--aah!
Whoa, man.
That was a short trip.
Master splinter's
walking stick.
He's never without it.
He must be in trouble.
SHREDDER:
Indeed, he is. Ha ha ha!
If you want
to see him again,
you'll have to come in.
It's gotta be a trap.
I hate it
when he says that.
Don't ask questions.
Just get a camera crew
down here now!
What do you mean,
I got to have a story first?
This the story!
Oh, yeah? You, too!
All right, now to find out
how good these turtles
really are.
Get the feeling somebody
has it in for us?
So, how do we get out?
There is no way out.
Well, that's kind of
a defeatist attitude,
don't you think?
What about that?
It could take hours
to crack the code.
Try 15 seconds, chum.
Leonardo, cut it open.
I feel like
a marshmallow
in a nutcracker.
Take your time,
why don't you?
Lights out.
So long, guys.
Hey, write us
when you hit bottom.
Ha ha!
This must be some kind
of manufacturing plant.
We are
in deep trouble.
You think they want
to mix it up with us?
If they do, I don't
like the odds.
Yeah, we were trained
to fight people,
not can openers.
So, like,
what do we do?
You and Raphael,
cut around
to either side.
Donatello,
try to get
to their rear.
What will you do,
Leonardo?
Well, somebody's gotta
take the middle.
Attack!
Hyah.
Rude, dude.
Turtles fight
with honor.
Taste cold steel.
Uhh. Get funky!
Get him,
Michelangelo!
Aah!
Get out of my face!
Our rear flank's
cut off, sarge!
Pblblblbt!
This way.
I'd say we redecorated
the place nicely.
More bad news.
Didn't I tell you?
Hit it,
Leonardo.
Splinter. I'll cut
you down, master.
SHREDDER:
I must congratulate you.
It's the same guys
we fought last night.
You passed your test
with flying colors.
Test? What test?
Your hairy little friend
knows me as oroku saki,
but you may call me...
The shredder.
A kitchen utensil?
You would be wise to
lose your flippant ways
if you wish to join
the honorable foot clan.
Why should we
want to do that?
Because it was I
who made you
what you are today.
If not for me,
hamato yoshi would never
have left Japan.
I followed him
to this country,
where I gained
my advanced technology,
including my rare
experimental mutagen.
It was I who caused you
to mutate
into your humanoid form.
You owe everything to me!
Don't deny your destiny.
Join me.
Does the phrase
"go suck a lemon"
hold any meaning
for you?
Let's cut
him down!
Very well.
I have my own mutants.
Bebop...
Rock steady...
Destroy them!
Grrr.
With great pleasure,
master shredder.
Grrr!
Arr!
Jump for it!
You idiots!
The mutation didn't
up their iqs any.
Come on, splinter.
We're checking out
of this dump.
Come on,
you fools.
I just hope I haven't
missed out on the action!
Rest here a moment,
master.
You know, that was
almost too easy.
I really wish you'd stop
saying things like that.
Rarrr!
Say your prayers,
turtles.
Come on, let's annihilate
those turkeys!
Didn't I see you
in
Ooh. What the--
aw, this is ridiculous.
We're never gonna
stop those guys.
Yeah, those jerks
belong in a zoo,
not the streets.
Michelangelo,
that's a brilliant notion.
Come on.
Where'd they go?
The party's over here!
Now for
the final showdown.
Sorry. We'll have to take
a rain check on that.
Now, you boys
have fun together,
and we'll be back
to check on you
in about 10 years.
Dumb, dumb, dumb.
Those dudes
are so dumb!
Ok, guys,
where's the action?
Afraid you missed
the good stuff.
Ohh. Well,
that's just great.
Of course
you could get a shot
of those 2 bozos.
Get back here
and fight,
you little
web-footed creeps.
Oh, wow!
Ooh,
the little bimbo!
I'll make you eat
that camera. Grrr!
Where'd those guys
come from?
Come on. We must
get splinter home.
Let's take the van.
I'm not letting you guys
out of my sight
until I've gotten
the whole story.
You'll get it.
Remember, the shredder's
still loose.
And probably
trucking around
in that
technodrome again.
What took you
so long?
Uh, you couldn't
maybe put us back
in that cage there,
could you?
