What the fuck is that?
Jimmy?
- What's up?
- Did I hit something?
What the fuck is that?
Maybe you got a flat?
No.
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.
He's still alive. You piece of shit!
Die, you motherfucker!
Look at me!
Tony Stacks. How are you?
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?
- It's your fault.
- You started it!
I started it? It's your fault.
Henry! Watch how you cross!
Bring back milk!
Tell him 519.
Did you have a good day at school?
Tell me about this.
It's a letter from school.
It says you haven't been there in months.
In months!
You're a bum!
Want to grow up to be a bum?
I can't make any more deliveries.
What? You'll fuck everything up.
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.
Come with me.
- Is that him there?
- No.
- How about him?
- No.
- That's the guy...
- Get him.
Excuse me.
- Scumbag.
- Come here, you piece of shit.
- Know this kid?
- Yeah.
- Know where he lives?
- Yeah.
- You deliver mail to his house?
- Yeah.
From now on, any letter from school
to his house comes directly here.
Understand?
Another letter from school
goes to that kid's house...
...in the oven you'll go, head first.
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?
All right, make the call.
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.
What do you think?
Aren't my shoes great?
You look like a gangster.
They shot me. Help!
Henry, shut the door.
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!
I can't have that in this joint.
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.
What's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.
The Irishman is here
to take you Guineas' money.
- Want a drink?
- Give me a Seven and Seven.
I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
How you doin'?
Thank you.
Keep them coming.
Give me your wallet.
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are.
Help the lady.
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.
Henry, come here.
Say hello to Tommy.
You're gonna be working together, okay?
Help him. Go ahead.
Jimmy, you got anything good?
I'd complain, but who'd listen?
- What do you need?
- Two Luckys.
- Here you go, Henry.
- Thanks a lot.
- What do you need?
- One Pall Mall.
What are you doing?
- It's all right.
- Says who? Your mother?
How many Pall Malls you need?
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay.
- It's not okay!
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. Store's closed.
- Henry got pinched.
- Where?
By the factory.
Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.
Docket #704162.
Yes, sir. That's me.
Just stand there. Now stay there.
Counselor, proceed.
Congratulations.
Here's your graduation present.
- Why? I got pinched.
- Everyone does, but you did it right.
- You told them nothing.
- I thought you'd be mad.
I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.
You took your first pinch like a man...
...and learned the two greatest things
in life.
Look at me.
Never rat on your friends...
...and always keep your mouth shut.
Here he is!
You broke your cherry!
Congratulations!
You got a phone? Come on!
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?
I'll get the papers, get the papers.
What is this? Coats?
I need suits, Henry, not coats.
Suits are up on Thursday.
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat.
Frankie, what the fuck does 520...
...have to do with 469?
What's that got to do with anything?
Piece of cake. Don't worry about
the alarms. I just got to get a key.
- No problems?
- I'll take care of it.
- Tell him what you were telling me.
- Too good to be true.
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.
Americans change their money over
into French money and send it back here.
- Calm down.
- It's beautiful.
It's totally, totally untraceable.
Our only problem is getting a key,
but I got a plan.
- Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
- Yeah, he's a piece of work.
If I'm right, there could be
half a mil coming in, all cash.
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.
There's a Jewish holiday Monday. They
won't find out until Tuesday. Beautiful.
What about the security?
Security?
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.
He just comes in like
he's picking up lost baggage.
- It's beautiful.
- It won't be a problem at all.
- Good.
- We're on.
What's really funny is that
fucking bank job in Secaucus.
I'm in the weeds lying down.
He said, "What are you doing?"
I said, "Resting."
"Here?"
"This ain't no beach or park."
"I'm resting!" I said.
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing."
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.
I'm coming around and who do I see
in front of me?
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"
I said, "What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother."
I thought he'd shit.
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.
Funny. You're really funny.
What do you mean, I'm funny?
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk? What?
It's just, you know. You're just funny.
You know, the way you tell the story.
Funny how? What's funny about it?
- Tommy, you got it all wrong.
- Anthony...
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
Funny, how?
Just, you know. You're funny.
Let me understand this.
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?
You know, how you tell a story.
No, I don't know. You said it.
You said I'm funny.
How am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny!
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.
Motherfucker! I almost had him!
You stuttering prick, you!
Frankie, was he shaking?
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning!
What's with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?
This guy didn't want to give you the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem. Tell him to put it on my tab.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order...
It's good you don't like to be out of order,
Sonny.
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.
You're a mutt. You know the money
we spend in this fucking...
- Don't be like that.
- Like what?
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too.
You're a funny guy.
That's it, Henry!
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.
I charged him $7,000.
You really are a funny guy.
I'm worried. I'm hearing bad things.
He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.
I got to go on the lam
to get away from this guy.
This ain't right. I can't go here or there.
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.
You've known this Tommy all your life.
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.
When I leave my house in the morning
I look over both shoulders.
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.
- Tell me what to do, I'll do it.
- What could I do?
If there was something I could do,
I would. I'd like to help you out.
Tell him what we talked about.
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?
It's a classy place.
You've been in here a million times.
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.
I don't mean any disrespect,
but that's the way it is.
I'm begging you. What can I say?
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?
I don't know anything about
the restaurant business.
All I know is how to sit down
and order a meal.
Not for you. Just a place to hang.
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.
I just need help. Help me, please.
Know anything about
the restaurant business?
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?
What do you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please.
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
God bless you, Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.
Do you need help reaching anything?
You look like you're
decorating a Christmas tree.
She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
The Jew broad. Diane.
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.
- No.
- No, what?
No, what? Who asked you anything?
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.
All right, what?
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that? In this day
and age? What is this world coming to?
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
So you come along for her friend.
See? I knew it. I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
- When is it?
- Tomorrow night.
I'm meeting Tuddy.
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.
- Why do you always do this?
- Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for? A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this broad. Help me out.
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.
You with your fucking mouth!
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.
Joe, can we have the check?
What are you doing?
- I got to go.
- We just got here.
I got that thing.
We'll leave together.
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.
- Ready?
- Lighten up.
We just got here. What are you doing?
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Tommy, what the fuck?
You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some big shot?
I forgot. I thought it was next week.
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!
We can talk about this.
Talk to you after what you just did to me?
Forget it.
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.
Let me make it up to you.
I'll think about it.
-
- I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.
Hello, Henry.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Come on.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that...
Mom.
Meet my friend, Henry Hill.
My daughter says you're half Jewish.
It's just the good half.
See you later.
You're leaving your car?
He watches the car for me.
It's easier than leaving it at a garage.
It's a lot quicker that way.
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.
How are you doin'? What's up?
Here you go.
- How are you doin', Gino?
- Good. How are you?
Every time I come here,
I see you two. Don't you work?
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?
Anthony, right in the front.
Anything you need, let me know.
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
You gave them $20 each.
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
Thanks a lot, Tony.
- What do you do?
- What?
- What do you do?
- I'm in construction.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
I'm a union delegate.
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.
Sixty thousand.
It's going to be a good summer.
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps.
Check, sir.
No. You have to sign for it here.
Should I tip him?
- How are you?
- Okay. And you?
- Henry, this is Bruce.
- Good to meet you.
I'll see you around later.
Do you know him?
Yeah.
He lives across the street.
"Roses are red, my love
"Violets are blue
"Sugar is sweet, my love
"But not as sweet as you"
Morrie, Jimmy's waiting. You're past due.
I've been good to you.
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.
Jimmy's being a ball breaker.
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.
I never had to pay
the vigorish he demands.
What am I, a schmuck?
You borrowed his money. Pay him.
I didn't agree to three points above the vig.
What are you going to do?
Going to fight with Jimmy Conway?
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go!
Fuck him!
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!
Did I ever bust his balls?
I could've dropped a dime a million times.
Don't call the cops. You're talking crazy.
You got money for that commercial!
You don't got my fucking money?
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.
I'll fucking kill you!
Give me the money, cocksucker.
Pay me!
He'll pay, he'll pay.
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.
Jimmy, I'm sorry.
You should be sorry. Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!
You hear me? Give me the fucking money!
I'll give you... You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.
Karen, slow down.
Where? Stay there. Don't move.
It's Karen.
What happened?
What happened? Are you all right?
Who did it?
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.
He started to touch me. He grabbed me.
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.
He pushed me out of the car.
You sure you're all right?
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.
What do you want, fucko?
I swear on my mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.
Don't shoot.
Hide this. Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Why don't you be like Henry?
He's got a nice girl.
He's settling down now. He's married.
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.
This is Marie.
She looks Italian.
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.
Paulie, you shouldn't have.
Welcome to the family.
Sunday dinner?
So beautiful. I want to cry.
Here's something to help you get started.
- The bag. The bag.
- What bag?
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to steal that here.
He didn't call?
- He's with his friends.
- What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.
A grown-up would get you an apartment.
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.
You're here a month and sometimes I know
he doesn't come home at all.
What kind of people are these?
- What do you want me to do?
- What can you do?
He's not Jewish. Did you know
what these people were like?
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.
Daddy never went out at all, Ma!
Keep out of it!
You don't know how I feel!
How do you feel now? You don't
know where he is or who he's with!
He's with his friends! Dad!
Leave him alone. He's suffered enough.
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.
Where were you? Why didn't you call?
We were worried! A married man does not
stay out like this!
Normal people don't act like this!
What's wrong with you?
You're not normal. She's right!
What's wrong with you?
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?
What kind of people are they?
- Karen, where you from?
- Lawrence.
On the Island. Nice.
I'm from Miami. Ever been there?
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.
Stop picking at that.
I'd like to smack his face.
The red-haired guy?
The guy's hands are all over me.
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."
She means it.
He's lucky. I just mention this to Vinnie...
How can you mention it? Vinnie'd kill him.
Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard,
then he'll be there for life.
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears...
...she has a heart attack and drops dead.
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
- Jeannie drinks.
- Maybe she's depressed.
Give me a break. She's drunk.
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.
She spends her life in a nightgown.
The woman is no angel, believe me.
I don't know if I could live like that!
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...
Do you know why Jeannie's
husband went to the can?
Because he wanted to get away from her.
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.
Unless they make themselves get caught.
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car.
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.
Where's the strong box, you varmint?
Don't fucking move! Don't move!
- See you at the diner.
- I'm riding shotgun.
Did you see him give it right over?
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.
Police.
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.
Would you read and sign it?
Anywhere?
We have to go through everything.
You want some coffee?
No coffee now, thanks.
- Be careful.
- We'll just go about our business.
"Happy birthday to you"
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.
- Can't do it.
- Why not?
I just can't. I got something lined up.
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.
- Pretty please?
- I can't. What do you want me to do?
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute.
I need money to go shopping.
How much?
That much.
This much. Give me a kiss.
See you later.
All right.
Welcome home, Batts.
Hi there. How are you?
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.
There's only one Irishman here.
It's a celebration.
- Top of the morning.
- It's good to be home.
This is my friend Jimmy.
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.
Tommy. All dressed up.
All grown up and doing the town.
Forgot you were having a party for him.
Come here.
I'll say hello. How are you, Billy?
I haven't seen you in six years.
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.
Watch the suit.
You little prick. I've known you all my life.
- Don't get too big on me.
- Just don't bust my balls.
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."
This kid was great.
I used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.
He was the best. Made a lot of money.
No more shines.
No more shines.
You been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.
I don't shine shoes anymore.
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.
I'm only kidding with you.
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry, too.
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.
Motherfucking mutt!
You fucking piece of shit!
Come on, come on!
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!
You bought your fucking button!
- Don't get nervous.
- You motherfucker!
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!
Come on, you fucking feel strong?
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?
Teach this kid a little fucking manners!
What's right is right.
- You understand what I'm saying?
- It's alright.
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.
- I didn't.
- You insulted him a little.
- I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
- Okay.
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.
No, have the drink with me.
The drinks are on the house.
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.
Fucking break up my party.
You been away for six years.
It's different now.
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.
- You're gonna get it.
- You understand?
Get the door!
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!
Let's shoot him.
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.
His crew'll be looking for him.
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.
Go open your trunk.
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her.
Look who's here.
What happened?
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.
What happened to him?
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?
You, too. How are you?
Why are you up so late?
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.
- Go to sleep. We're leaving.
- I can't. Not while he's home.
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.
You go inside.
This stuff is like lead.
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.
You haven't called. Where have you been?
I been working nights.
And tonight we were out late.
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay? Just for a while.
The poor thing.
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?
The paw.
- The hoof.
- Got caught in the grill.
I got to hack it off.
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.
I'll bring the knife back.
Delicious.
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?
I do, almost every night.
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you! I want to be with you.
Settle down.
How's your friend Henry?
What's the matter? You don't talk much.
Talk. What are you quiet for?
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.
- I'm just listening.
- Something wrong?
When we were kids,
the  used to visit each other.
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking!"
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.
-
- That's it.
It means he's content to be a jerk.
He doesn't care who knows it.
Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
Look at this.
It's beautiful.
One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.
One's facing east, the other west.
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got a nice head of white hair.
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.
Looks like someone we know.
Without the beard. It's him.
It's him.
What the fuck is that?
We saw Sammy Davis, Jr. You got to see
this show. What a performer!
He does impersonations.
It was like the real people!
Unbelievable. You could see how
a white girl could fall for him.
What?
Not me. But you could see how some
girls could. Like that Swedish girl.
So you condone that stuff.
Take it easy.
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.
I don't mean me.
But, you know, he's got personality.
"Personality?"
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.
I just said he was talented.
Just leave it alone now.
He's talented. Leave it at that.
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?
What did you hear about that thing?
The Brooklyn thing?
The guy from downtown.
The guy from where Christie lived?
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.
Know the guy I mean?
His name was Batts.
His people are driving everyone crazy
looking for him.
Nobody knows what happened.
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared.
Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.
Okay, everybody, let's eat.
I want my money.
I want my money. He owes it.
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?
- Paulie was talking about that.
- We must move it.
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.
- It's been six months.
- We got to move it right away.
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.
- Here's an arm.
- Very funny.
Here's a leg.
Here's a wing.
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?
Oh, that's so bad.
What happened to the car?
I hit a skunk, all right?
Go with your mother.
It's disgusting, Henry.
My new antique lamp.
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.
Looks like Roma.
This is all silk. This is from Siam.
Come see my bedroom.
- Tommy, will you take him?
- I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.
Love that crystal ball or what?
This is where we spend most of our time.
I love the floral arrangements.
French.
Janice can do what she wants to do!
Got it?
Just try to run. Hang up once more
and you'll deal with me!
Get off of her.
You're an animal.
Spider, on your way here,
bring me a Cutty and water.
- Did you guys eat?
- I'm starving.
- I'll play these.
- You'll play those?
Do I stutter? I play those.
What am I? A mirage?
Where's my fucking drink?
- You wanted a drink?
- I asked you for one.
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."
- I thought it was Henry.
- You're a stuttering fuck.
You said, "I'm all right, Spider."
You ain't all right.
No, you said you were all right.
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.
You been doing this all night to me,
motherfucker!
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.
Get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you prick!
You walk like "Stepin Fetchit."
For everybody else you run.
Run for me!
Dance the fucking drink back here!
What's that Bogart movie?
- Where he played a cowboy.
- .
?
Oklahoma Kid, that's me.
You fucking varmint. Dance!
Yahoo, motherfucker!
Round up those fucking wagons.
Now he's moving.
Shot in the foot.
He's fine. So he got shot in the foot.
Big fucking deal.
Get a towel.
Nice fucking game.
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.
Take him to the doctor down the street.
Bones are all shattered.
Don't get me upset.
Don't make a big fucking thing
out of it, Spider!
You trying to make me think
what I did here.
It was an accident.
Little fucking actor.
- You in?
- I'm in.
- Eight hundred.
- Eight hundred?
You haven't been home in two weeks!
You're not going out tonight!
Will you grow up! I'm still going to go out!
Not without your car keys.
Are you nuts? What's your problem?
Yes! Something's going on!
- Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that!
- No!
I look in your face and I know you're lying!
- Get out! Get out!
- Shut up!
Out of my life!
You're fucked in the head.
It's in your mind.
- You're a lousy bastard!
- You got a problem.
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!
Spider, what's your rush?
Thank you.
Spider, that bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.
Next thing you know he'll have
one of these fucking walkers.
But you can still dance.
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter.
Tell the truth. You want sympathy.
Go fuck yourself, Tommy.
I didn't hear right.
I can't believe what I heard.
This is for you.
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.
Good. Don't take shit from nobody.
He shoots him in the foot and
he tells him to go fuck himself.
Tommy, you going to let this
fucking punk get away with that?
What's this world coming to?
That's what the fucking world's coming to.
- How's that?
- What is wrong with you?
What is the fucking matter with you?
Are you stupid or what?
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?
How do I know if you're kidding?
I'm kidding with you
and you fucking shoot the guy?
He's dead.
Good shot. I'm a good shot.
- Hard to miss at this distance.
- You got a problem with what I did?
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.
Stupid bastard! I can't believe you.
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?
Not the first hole I dug.
Where are the shovels?
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.
Hello? Don't hang up on me!
Answer me!
I'll tell everyone who walks in here...
...that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!
Superintendent?
I want you to know you have a whore...
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?
Wake up, Henry.
What are you doing?
Karen, are you crazy?
I am crazy.
And I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.
Karen, take it easy.
Do you love her?
Do you?
Do you?
I love you. You know I love you.
You don't.
No, you don't.
Be careful, baby. Don't.
Just put it down.
You know I love you, don't you?
You're all I want, Karen.
Please put the gun down.
Baby, come on.
What are you, fucking crazy?
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!
I got to fucking come home... for this?
I should fucking kill you!
- How does it feel?
- I'm sorry.
How does it feel, Karen?
I'm sorry!
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?
- Looking good.
- Thank you. Good to see you.
- Hi, Paulie!
- Hi, honey. How are you?
- Go get some cigarettes, okay?
- Sure.
- Any of you need anything?
- I'm all right.
- You want anything to drink? A beer?
- No, this...
- Chinese food?
- No, come on, sit down.
Karen came to the house.
She's very upset.
You got to straighten this out.
We got to have calm now.
We don't know what she'll do.
She's hysterical. Very excited.
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.
I'm not saying to go back to her right now,
but you got to go back.
You got to keep up appearances.
The two of them come
to my house every day.
I can't have it.
I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it.
Nobody says you can't do what you want.
We all know that. This is what it is.
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family.
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.
You got to go home. Smarten up.
I'll talk to Karen.
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.
I'll say you'll go back to her
and it'll be like when you first got married.
You'll romance her. It'll be beautiful.
I know how to talk to her.
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa
this weekend to pick up something for me.
Instead, you'll go with Jimmy.
You come with me.
Have a good time.
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.
We'll have a good time.
When you come back,
you'll go back to Karen.
Please, there's no other way.
No divorce. We're not .
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.
She'll kill him, but not divorce him.
You going to pay us?
Give us the fucking money!
I can't.
Let's go.
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
Lions? I ain't going near any lions!
Throw him over the moat.
I'll get the money!
I'll get the money.
They mean business.
Ten years in a federal penitentiary.
You will now be turned over...
...to the U.S. Attorney General.
Toast, guys. Good trip,
good life. Get out soon.
Good trip, sweetheart.
We'll watch the home front.
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.
Motherfuck them every chance you get.
I'll call you when I get a chance.
Now take me to jail.
Get that smell?
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:
Veal, beef, and pork.
You got to have pork.
That's the flavor.
Don't put too many onions in the sauce.
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.
- There are only three small onions.
- Three onions? How many tomatoes?
- Two big cans.
- You don't need three onions.
- How do you like yours?
- Medium rare.
Medium rare. An aristocrat.
Give me two steaks.
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.
They deserved it.
People used to be able
to leave their doors open.
Sorry it took so long.
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.
- We have to take care of that bastard.
- I took care of him.
What'd you bring?
Some bread.
I got peppers and onions.
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.
What else?
- Scotch.
- Nice.
- Red wine.
- Okay.
- Now we can eat.
- Some white, too.
Beautiful. Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, Johnny, Vinnie.
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.
Read 'em and weep.
What are you doing?
I'll catch you guys later.
Going for a walk in the park?
I'll catch you next week. Thanks.
- Is there any more?
- No, that's it. Have a good weekend.
You girls stay right here.
- Hold hands.
- Go right up front.
What?
I saw her name on the register.
Want her to visit you?
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing to the parole board.
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.
I can't stop people from visiting me.
Let her sneak this stuff
in for you every week.
Let her fight these bastards every week!
Look what you're doing! Stop it!
I'm sorry.
Let her sneak this shit in for you.
Will you stop it?
- Let her do it!
- Stop it!
Nobody's helping me. I am all alone.
Belle and Morrie are broke.
I asked your friend Remo
for the money he owes you.
He told me to take the kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.
It's going to be okay.
I've never seen Paulie since he got out.
I never see anyone.
That's what happens when you go away.
We're on our own. Forget everybody else.
Forget Paulie.
As long as he's on parole
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.
All I need is for you to bring me this stuff.
A guy in here from Pittsburgh
will help me move it.
In a month we'll be fine.
We won't need anybody.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...
He is not helping us out.
Is he putting any food on the table?
We've got to help each other.
We got to be really,
really careful while we do it.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Never.
- We missed you.
- Are you here to stay?
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.
I did the sun.
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?
Do you like the house?
- Get packed. We're moving out.
- With what?
Don't worry.
Just start looking for a new house.
I got to go to Pittsburgh.
Those guys owe me $15,000.
We'll be okay. I got things lined up.
Pittsburgh? You have to see
your parole officer.
Don't worry about it.
Everything will be fine.
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
What do you want?
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?
I don't want any more of that shit.
- What are you talking about?
- Just stay away from the garbage.
Inside, you did what you had to do.
I'm talking about now. From here and now.
- Why would I get into that?
- Don't make a jerk of me.
Just don't do it.
Don't do it.
I want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.
He's a good earner,
but he takes too many chances.
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.
He's got too much to prove.
- You got to watch out for them.
- I only use them for certain things.
I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.
Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll
die in prison. I don't need that.
So I'm warning everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello
to some fuck who was selling junk.
That won't happen to me, understand?
You're out early because I got you a job.
I don't need this heat.
You see anybody with shit you tell me.
Anybody.
- All right.
- Yeah?
Yeah. Of course.
It's fucking great.
You bring your pay slips?
Four and a half months of dirt.
- It's so good.
- I did it.
- Do you love it?
- It's wonderful.
This we had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it.
The others you couldn't even sit in.
Okay, ready?
Watch the wall with the rock.
The electricians did it special. Come on.
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?
- Nice, huh?
- Come here. Did you and Jimmy talk?
He's looking into everything.
It'll make the Air France hold
look like peanuts.
Come on.
- He'll do it, right?
- I told you.
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.
I've been cultivating this
son of a bitch for two years.
He owes me 20 grand. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.
Let's get a drink.
Have a drink and shut up.
Have a good flight?
I hate Pittsburgh. They're such creeps.
They're not that bad.
And it's worth it, isn't it?
Is this the same baby you used last week?
No, that was my sister's. This is Deirdra's.
Big yawn.
She looks like you.
That's what the stewardess said.
Take it easy.
Give me a break. You got plenty.
You got all day. Let's make it last,
all right? Take it easy.
- I got to go.
- Where are you going?
Don't start. You know I got to go
do this thing. Where are my keys?
Over there.
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.
Why do you think I got you a dishwasher?
Fucks up my nails.
You got to be smart.
There's enough powder here
to put us away forever.
Loosen up.
What are you doing?
You don't have to go anywhere.
Make them wait.
Those sons of bitches!
Come here, you! Come here!
Look at this genius. This genius!
Merry Christmas, Jimmy!
- Who's this?
- This is my wife.
Come here. I want to show you something,
Jimmy.
Isn't she gorgeous? I bought it
for my wife. It's a coupe. I love that car.
What did I tell you?
I talked to you, didn't I?
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while? The fucking car?
It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name. I just got married.
- I love that car.
- Excuse me for a second.
- I just got married.
- Are you nuts?
- Why are you getting excited?
- Are you stupid?
We got a million fucking bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.
I don't give a fuck.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything. Don't get anything.
What's the matter with you?
What are you getting excited for?
Because you're going to get us all pinched.
- What's the matter with you?
- I apologize.
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
It's under my mother's name.
What'd you say? You being a wise guy?
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?
You don't buy anything!
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.
I can't believe this. Are you stupid?
Excuse me.
- Take it off.
- Why?
Take it off!
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
or attract attention?
One guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.
I'll return it.
Bring it back where you got it. Get it out
of here. Understand? Get it out of here!
This drink here is better than sex, babe.
I'm going to see Stacks.
Don't you look at anybody or I'll kill you.
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.
That's great.
I tell them all not to attract attention.
What do they do?
I've been looking all over for you.
Listen, I need the money.
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
- I need the money.
I'm relaxing. I need the money.
- I did what I had to do.
- Not tonight, Morrie.
I did my caper. He owes me.
Everyone's flashing stuff. They got money.
I'm wearing the same shit.
They're wearing it. I got to talk to him.
I got 500 grand coming to me.
The biggest bundle he made in his life.
I'll go talk to him. Go have a drink.
- I'll talk to him.
- It's poison in my eyes.
- Morris, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.
We did it!
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Pete? One second.
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!
I got the most expensive tree they had.
- What do you think, Mommy?
- I love them all.
I love the gold outfit.
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.
And? And?
Happy Hanukkah.
- Very funny.
- Go get yourself something nice.
Yo, Stacks!
Open up!
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.
- You didn't bring any coffee?
- Do I look like a caterer?
Frankie will make coffee. Make coffee.
Thought you'd have a bitch in here.
I did. Where the fuck is she?
Always got these hot books around
or a bitch.
What time is it?
- It's 11:30. We were to be there by 9:00.
- I'll be ready in a minute.
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own funeral.
What are you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.
A joke. Put the fucking pot down.
I got to talk to you.
- Have a drink.
- Have a drink. Come on.
Have a drink. What are you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.
I still have to talk to you.
- What happened with Stacks?
- Don't worry about that.
- There's feds all over the place.
- So what? Where are they going to go?
- It's in the papers.
- He's worried.
What are you worried about?
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.
- What are you worried about?
- You worry too much.
Everything is beautiful.
Didn't you tell him?
Not yet.
- What?
- Guess what?
They are going to make him.
Paulie's going to make you?
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.
Can you believe that? This Guinea bastard.
He's getting made. We'll work for
this guy one day. He'll be a boss.
I can't believe it.
I'm happy for you. Congratulations.
Motherfuckers, we got them now.
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?
I masterminded the whole thing,
I'm left with dick.
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! I want my money.
I want my money! I've had it up to here!
That cheap cigarette hijacker.
- Fuck him! I want my money!
- Good. Go tell him.
Now will you keep you mouth shut?
Morrie, you'll get your money.
You just got to stop busting balls.
All right. You hear me?
Everything's going to be fine.
"Oh, Henry boy, the pipes,
the pipes are calling"
Half Mick, half Guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.
"And down the glen,
the glen and down the mountainside
"The summer's gone
"And all the roses dying"
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?
Morrie? Him?
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.
Nobody cares what he says,
he talks so much.
Make sure you bring him here tonight.
- Okay?
- All right.
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?
Stop breaking my balls.
I pulled out his hair. I bit him.
He's out cold.
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.
I walk away. We start to go in this joint.
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's doing this to me.
I don't want to fucking turn around.
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says, "Ah..."
I said, "Don't say it!"
"Jerkoff!"
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him!
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
- You're a pisser. A real pisser.
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.
I've never met a ball buster like you.
Who loves you more than I do?
- I'd do anything for you.
- Except stop busting my balls.
- Let's go have coffee.
- Want to go to the diner?
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.
- Which diner?
- Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.
- They got danishes?
- They got everything.
Let's pick up some danishes for Belle.
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio...
I thought he'd never shut up.
What a pain in the ass.
- What'll we do with him?
- Chop him up and get rid of the car.
Call me when you're through.
- Frank, let's chop him up.
- All right.
- Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker?
- You said chop him up.
At Charlie's, not here!
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.
I got a better shot letting him drive.
The car's cold.
Get out of here! What, warm it up?
Get out of here!
- Who is it?
- It's Belle. Open up.
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.
Calm down.
He's missing! I know something happened.
He's probably drunk and fell asleep
somewhere.
In 27 years he's never been
away all night without calling.
Something's happened. I know you know.
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.
I've been home! I've been on the phone...
He's playing cards.
- What'll I tell Belle?
- Who gives a fuck?
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?
- Watch this.
- Don't fuck with them.
I'll bust their fucking balls.
Don't give them the satisfaction, the fucks.
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.
Keep them up all night.
I'll see you later.
- Ma, where are you?
- Here I am.
- You're home.
- Home? I'm leaving.
- You look lovely.
- I look good, huh?
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.
God be with you.
How many years since you were made?
I'm an old-timer. Thirty years ago.
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?
- Who's this?
-
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?
What do you mean?
I knew it!
I can't fucking believe it.
- They fucking whacked him.
- Fuck.
Are you all right?
That's that.
What good are these? None of them fit.
I'm not paying for these!
The drugs are making your mind
into mush!
I'll take 'em back.
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.
I'm fine.
Get over here.
Let me check you out.
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
Right up there.
I think it's been following me all morning.
- Get the fuck out. Are you nuts?
- I'm telling you.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.
Oh, God. I see it.
- Look, it's right there.
- Damn!
That's it.
We got to get to your mother's.
See, I told you.
It's funny.
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.
Tell your mother not to touch anything
outside of the house. Nothing.
Why didn't you go to your mother's house?
Let's go shopping.
No, I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all fucking morning!
Alright. He thinks I'm paranoid!
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.
Come on, let's go inside.
Yeah, it's gone.
- I don't hear anything.
- Let's go back to your mother's.
- They all right?
- They're great.
Didn't I say you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?
Yeah. I need a hit.
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.
I've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.
- It's Sandy. What the fuck is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.
-
- In an hour.
-
- I can't. I got my brother tonight.
Come on, stop. Stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Good-bye.
- Hello?
-
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.
-
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois!
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.
Understand me? Call from an outside line.
I mean it!
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb.
I know what to do.
You little hick, just make sure you do it!
-
- Okay.
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
- What'd he say?
- Nothing.
Do you think you can come over,
fuck me, then leave?
- Got someplace better to go?
- Don't talk like that. Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
- That's the last one?
- Yeah.
You lying son of a bitch! I hate you!
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...
...from the plate on top of it. Stop it.
- I have to.
- You don't have to.
I got to go home.
What do you mean you got to go home?
We got to tape this stuff to your leg.
We got to go soon.
I got to go home and get my hat.
Forget your fucking hat!
Are you kidding me?
I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?
I got to have it. It's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.
Do you understand
what we are involved in?
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.
A hat?
What the fuck is this?
Police! Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!
I'll blow your brains out!
Shut the car off slowly!
Don't fucking move.
Michael! Lock the door!
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar? I'm talking to you.
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't give a fuck.
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.
Just get the lawyer.
You know the boys. All the pals are here.
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a fucking problem all night.
Each one of these counts holds
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.
What, were you guys grocery shopping?
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?
You got anything good in there?
Is it good?
Bye-bye, dickhead.
See you in Attica, dick.
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.
He wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.
Fuck Jimmy and his money!
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.
Then you're better off staying in here.
They could whack me in here as easy as
outside. They're afraid I'll rat them out.
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.
Fuck! Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
I flushed it down the toilet.
What?
What was I supposed to do?
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?
I had to! They were going to find it!
- They wouldn't have found it!
- They would have! I swear!
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?
- They would have found it.
- Why did you do that?
Oh, my God!
- I had to do it.
- Oh, my God!
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.
Yeah, you fucked up.
But I'm all right now.
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.
You know, I was ashamed.
I'm ashamed now.
But I got nowhere else to go.
You're all I got. And I really,
really need your help. I really do.
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
-
-
Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?
I don't want to do that.
If we stay around here we're dead.
You got it? We' re dead.
They're right. You took too much
of that stuff. You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good. Glad to hear it.
- What kind of questions they been asking?
- I don't know.
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.
Tell him he's got to call me.
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
- Take this. It's a couple thousand.
- Thanks, Jimmy.
Don't worry, everything will be all right.
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
- For my mom.
- Yeah, whatever.
Not here. In the store on the corner.
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.
- Thanks.
- Don't worry.
- I'll try.
- He's got to call me.
Over here?
Right down there.
It's over there, on the corner.
Right there.
No! Go ahead! It's right there!
No, Jimmy! I'm in a hurry!
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!
I'll come back later!
What happened?
Nothing.
- What happened?
- I just got scared.
Got the keys?
What happened?
I just got scared. It's okay.
Are you all right?
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.
Now you understand?
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat this case.
Well, you know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon
as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.
I know where he is. He's hiding out.
Know what I'm saying?
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?
No, not at all.
That way they got nothing.
Wherever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...
...I don't want to go any place cold.
You don't have a choice.
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...
...just no place cold. Do that for me.
He's bronchial, that's why.
If he's bronchial we'll consider that.
I'd like to go someplace not cold.
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?
What about them?
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?
No.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me...
...if something happens to my parents
and they get sick, I can't see them?
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick.
If there's extraordinary circumstances...
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.
I can't leave my parents.
Karen, I told you before.
I'm not going to do this unless
you and the kids come with me.
I can't do it without you.
So you do whatever, but... that's it.
- You need Henry, not me, right?
- That's right.
I don't care whether you go or not.
If it'll make him a better witness,
I want you with him.
They don't want me.
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.
If he goes into the program
you're in danger.
- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me...
...the babe-in-the-woods routine.
I've listened to those wiretaps
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.
Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...
...or stays on the streets, he's a dead man.
He knows it and you know it.
What about the kids and school?
I mean, what goes on?
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.
We'll save your life, his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.
This morning you told the jury
about your background.
- Do you see him here in this courtroom?
- Yes.
Will you please point him out for the jury?
Let the record show that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record show Mr. Hill
identified the defendant Paul Cicero.
I have a document...
People call them rats because
they will do anything to survive.
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about it!
Didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
