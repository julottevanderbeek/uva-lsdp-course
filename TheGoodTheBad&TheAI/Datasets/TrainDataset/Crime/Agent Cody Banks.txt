Morning.
Dad, we have to discuss my allowance -
I need a raise.
Alex, buying your girlfriend more
gummi bears won't close the deal.
Like you'd know.
But Mom, Cody's almost 16
and I've had twice as many dates as him.
Sitting in a tree house
isn't exactly a date.
- It is when you're playing doctor.
- Bye!
You smell good. Did you shave?
- Don't forget your chores.
- I'll do them later.
Cody, those guinea pigs have been
sitting in excrement for days.
Alex, you play with them more than I do -
how about we trade chores?
I'll mow the lawn three times.
No way. Just cos I'm ten doesn't mean
I don't know what excrement means.
We're eating here.
Sweetie, Mommy will be right back.
My baby! My baby's in that car!
Somebody stop that car!
Unlock the door!
Hey, kid! Get out the way!
Next time, please stick with a tricycle.
Sweetie, it's OK.
- What happened?
- Some kid stopped it.
Dr. Connors, we've given you
a great deal of money.
We expect results.
If you gentlemen would step this way,
please? Gather round.
Imagine we're somewhere in Alaska
and an oil tanker runs aground.
What do we get?
An oil spill, one of the most serious
threats to nature.
A calamity that could take generations
for sea life to recover.
But wait-what's this?
Look who's coming.
The nanobots.
Lovely.
Baby seals everywhere
will praise your name, Doctor.
So, is that real oil, Connors?
Oh, yeah.
Here's a sample.
You can test it if you want.
Can they be programmed
to eat anything other than oil?
Theoretically they could break down
any silicon- Or carbon-based compound.
- You have ten days.
- What?
- That's impossible.
- He said you have ten days.
We have our own agenda, Doctor.
- That's impossible.
- Goodbye, Dr. Connors.
He still has no idea
what we hope to achieve.
Let's keep it that way, François.
- I told you no ice. Here.
- I'm sorry, sir.
You never know how long
it's been in the freezer,
could be filled with all kind of crap.
This is Dr. Albert Connors.
The world's foremost expert in
nanotechnology-microscopic robots.
These robots could be programmed
to destroy our most vital communication
and military infrastructure.
I'm talking missile guidance systems,
boats, tanks,
planes, biological and...
We get the point. Before we lost contact,
Agent Bolivar confirmed that Connors
is working with E.R.I.S.
This is probably my last transmission.
I think they're onto me.
Don't send any more agents -
everyone has been compromised.
I'd better transmit images now.
This is yesterday
at the E.R.I.S. covert conference
where Dr. Connors demonstrated
his latest advancements.
And this is Dr. Brinkman, head of E.R.I.S.
And this, François Molay, his henchman.
As far as I understand it, they plan...
We need to know what they're planning.
The problem is,
Connors is very reclusive.
After his wife died two years ago, Connors
dropped out of public view.
His only contact with the outside world is
through his daughter Natalie.
I wanna get close to this girl.
McAllister,
brief the staff
on the Agent Development Program.
Under the guise of an elite summer camp,
we began to recruit.
Welcome to
the Agent Development Program.
Since 1987, and under strict secrecy,
the CIA has recruited juvenile agents
the nation over.
As soon as we received word that
a potential candidate had been spotted,
we brought them into our facilities
under the guise of summer camps.
Their parents had no idea
of their real activities.
They were expertly trained
in combat, defense,
navigation and, of course,
explosives defusion.
Our juvenile agents
are stationed all over the nation.
They meticulously maintain
the facades of normal childhoods
as they await their call for duty.
Wait, wait, wait.
You're telling me we're training
children to become agents?
Teenagers.
Look, let's be clear about this -
this may be our last best chance.
These kids operate alone?
No, that would be irresponsible.
One of our most impressive agents. Lives
not far from Natalie Connors.
Smart, resourceful,
and, according to my reports,
he's quite a lady-killer.
Do you...?
Hi, Cody.
Are you in special ed?
Hi, Cody!
Do you think, Amy, that...
Friday night we...
Cody, I need to study,
so why don't you go jump off a cliff
or something?
Cody Banks.
You want him?
She wants Cody.
Quiet! Or you'll all be in trouble.
- You, come with me.
- Why?
Hey, I wanna be in trouble.
Since you're on the business
of taking towels, take mine too.
Could you hold this, please? Thank you.
I really hate it...
when people talk back.
Thank you. Let's go.
Who are you? What did I do?
Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow.
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.
Bubblegum, bubblegum in a dish.
How many pieces do you wish?
This is what happens when you design
a code book at summer camp!
So I'm being called up?
My country needs me?
- Yep.
- Where are we going?
The Middle East? Russia? China?
Downtown Seattle.
I'm in! My first mission!
Didn't think it would happen this soon?
Plus, I didn't think my partner was...
Let's get one thing straight,
I am not your partner.
I'm your handler.
Like in the zoo.
You will speak only when spoken to,
you will follow orders without question.
If you're lucky, you might...
How did you get in here?
There's no school tour today.
I'm not on a school tour. I'm an agent.
I just came from basketball practice,
I left my ID in my other clothes.
- I'm with Ronica Miles.
- You wish!
Here he is.
Sir, I've apprehended a trespasser.
It was a bit of a struggle.
- What's your name?
- Rosychuk.
Come here, Rosychuk.
You know, you've just apprehended
the most important kid in America!
Mr. Banks, this way, this way.
What was he thinking?
You got agent written all over you.
It's in the eyes.
You got it, kid. Come on.
Welcome to the CIA.
So you like the Sonics? What about
front-row seats for the play-offs?
We've prepared a briefing
to explain nanobots to you.
Yeah, I know them.
Tiny weapons, giant potential.
Micro-devices built up of compounds
of polymer cobalt and gold,
or constructed with multiple fullerene
complexes called buckysomes,
universal assemblers
that can bond circuits,
with the most impressive tests
having been conducted
at Sweden's Lintzerpein University.
I guess we can move on.
Let's turn to Natalie Connors.
Natalie Connors, 15 years old.
Hair blonde, eyes brown.
Likes horses-preferably Arabians -
pistachio ice cream, turquoise jewelry,
and TS Eliot.
Learn everything you can about
this girl. I want you to get close to her.
That's my mission?
I have to get close to her?
Yes. Insinuate yourself into her life.
It is imperative you find out what
her father and E.R.I.S. are planning.
We'll help.
We've placed you in all of her classes.
All of them? Isn't that a little creepy?
Creepy?
We're the CIA, that's what we do. Right?
You want me to become her boyfriend?
It's simple. Natalie has a birthday soon.
Her father's throwing a party.
The first step is to get invited
to that party.
And be careful. This is not secret agent
little league any more.
This is the show, Mr. Banks,
and this is showtime.
If you can't handle it,
you just tell me now.
You can count on me.
Attention. Rocket launch test.
I know it's tempting
but don't touch anything.
Four, three,
two, one.
Mr. Banks, come see me, son.
I've prepared a number of dope items
which I think you're gonna be down with.
This item here is equipped
with a virtual telephoto lens,
low-penetration X-ray.
Give me that!
This is your cell phone.
It's a state-of-the-art
mobile command center
with a holographic audiovisual display
and a personal GPS transceiver.
Now, this is a CIA
get-out-of-trouble watch.
See this silver button?
Be very careful
with this little silver button
cos it'll make people go...
Wait, what was that?
Wait, one more time.
I don't even wanna know.
All right, let's wrap this up.
Five thousand dollars cash.
What for?
I think they buy things with it.
I don't know. I believe.
OK, that's it.
Thanks for coming.
Wait. I think we're forgetting something.
- I'm not.
- What about those wheels?
No, Cody, that's on a need-to-drive
basis. You don't need to drive.
I need to impress the girls.
So we got you fixed up. Look at this.
This thing is really full of surprises.
- Fine.
- I think you're gonna impress the girls.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
You're transferring to a prep school?
Yeah, I got a full scholarship
to Donovan Prep Academy.
A scholarship? Hold on.
I don't understand. When did you apply?
Did I sign something?
Yeah, a few months ago.
It's always been my dream to go there.
It has? But what about your friends?
- I'll make new ones.
- With all those spoiled brats?
And why would they want you?
Diversity. At least five per cent
of the students have to be normal.
I don't know about this.
I wanna make something very clear,
I am not agreeing to anything until I meet
an administrator from that school.
Mr. Banks.
Ronica Miles from the William Donovan
Preparatory Academy.
I'm an administrator from the school.
Agent Banks.
I heard you really closed the deal
with Amy.
- You should try gummi bears.
- How do you know about that?
- Everybody knows.
- She thinks I'm a loser.
Amy, I...
I'm in high school.
Cody is a wonderful student with
extraordinary math and science abilities.
- What is it exactly that you do?
- Dean of admissions.
Donovan Academy feels he isn't being
challenged in his current environment.
Do you have some kind of paperwork?
Of course.
You guys ready for the test?
- Nervous?
- No.
Got your schedule?
"Honors English, trig, chemistry"?
I don't need all of this.
I could just meet her between classes.
You will attend every class as instructed.
You might even learn something.
This isn't what I had in mind
when I signed on to the CIA.
Well, I didn't think
I'd be chaperoning teenagers.
You know, maybe you should try decaf.
It's my job to make sure you do your job.
If you screw up, I take the heat.
So I guess she grows on you. Right?
No.
Admission papers, hat.
Hat? What hat?
Seattle Seahawks,
they're her favorite football team.
You know, it's an icebreaker.
A conversation starter.
Look! That guy has a bird on his head.
- Guys!
- No, it looks good.
I'm not wearing this, I look like an idiot.
There's two minutes till first period,
you don't wanna be tardy.
What if she doesn't like me?
What's not to like?
Sorry.
Target acquired.
New kid.
You're the scholarship case
from the other side of town, right?
Pleased to meet you.
My name's Cody. Banks.
Banks? We got something
in common, Cody.
My dad owns banks.
- Very funny. I gotta go.
- Not so fast.
Check it out.
- Come on, give it back.
- What are you gonna do about it?
If you're gonna keep my watch,
promise me you won't touch
that silver button.
- That silver button?
- Yeah, don't touch it.
I told you not to touch it.
Are those books?
I love books. I gotta read all day.
Love 'em.
Great. Then you're in the right place.
I especially love TS Eliot.
- You do?
- I think she's amazing.
The way she captures the female
perspective is just so female-like.
It's great.
TS Eliot is a man.
If you wanna get technical, of course,
but you never know these days.
Do you by any chance happen to be
in special ed?
I love horses.
I think...
their hair thing is really cool.
What a freak.
...two and divide by x minus two
and we'll end up with...
Natalie Connors. Way out of your league.
...point 4968. Any questions?
Driver's Ed.
- Oh, my God. Are you gonna go?
- Yeah, it's gonna be great.
- Uh-oh, here comes horse guy.
- Good luck.
Hey. You got Driver's Ed too?
What's the deal?
You're in every one of my classes.
I guess great minds think alike.
Great, we've got Mr. Yip.
He doesn't pass anybody.
Look, if you don't pass,
I'm sure your dad can drive you around.
It's because of my dad
that I need a license.
- So you can drive him around?
- No, so I can drive me around.
- Why, is he busy with something?
- Yeah.
He's always doing
some kind of experiment.
- Like a scientific experiment?
- Yeah, he's a scientist.
- Cool! With microscopes?
- You're getting weird again.
Good afternoon, children.
Driving is a privilege, not a right.
I'd be delighted to instruct you
in operation of motor vehicle.
But, I have a larger responsibility
to protect society at large
from the idiots
and the drug-addled delinquents
who call themselves...
the youth of today.
Today!
You name Miss Connors?
Yeah? You first!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Look left, look right!
You didn't turn on your blinks!
Are you dyslexic?
This is your left, that is your right.
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the driver's seat!
OK, I...
One grandma.
Multiple cones, three curbs.
- Who can drive with you screaming?
- You fail. Fail! Fail!
- No, I need to get my license.
- Next!
Damn, the floor mat isn't straight.
- All ready.
- Good.
What are you doing now?
What are you doing now?
Stop the car! Stop the car right now!
- Did I pass?
- Nat, are you OK?
Oh, my God, he almost rolled over.
- Come on.
- Actually, I don't feel so good.
He totally could have killed you.
Just stay away from her.
Are you OK?
You! I will personally go to DMV.
You will not receive a driver's license!
Never!
- Mr. Yip.
- What?
We'd like to have a word about
Mr. Banks' driver's license.
Immigrations paper OK!
My fellow agents.
- Good luck.
- Good luck.
- He's dead.
- So dead.
Hey, Cody.
- How did it go today?
- Great.
I've got her eating out of my hand.
Fantastic.
So, she invited you to the party?
No, but the vibes are right.
- Have you asked her out yet?
- Not yet. But don't rush me.
The clock's ticking. What about tonight?
It's a school night. I got homework.
- What's the problem?
- Nothing, but Natalie's a brain.
All those AP classes.
My workload's insane.
- This mission depends on you.
- I know, but...
Come on. Tonight I had to do
two chapters of trigonometry.
Plus an essay on Henry V,
not to mention my chores.
- Of course, if I had a little help...
- I can't believe this.
All right... The agency will take care
of your chores and your homework.
You focus on the girl.
Teams A and B commence
domestic sanitation.
Team three, I need a new sponge. Repeat,
need a new sponge, over.
You missed a spot.
Negative, negative.
Stand by, flannel only...
Which one would you prefer -
this one or this one?
- I like this myself.
- Good choice.
We have dust bunnies
on the second floor.
...to develop a secret weapon.
I'm gonna transmit images now.
This is Dr. Brinkman,
head of E.R.I.S., and this...
François Molay, his henchman.
- Get out of the house!
- What? They're here?
They shouldn't be here for another hour.
- I don't know...
- Come on. Move, move.
- Move it, get out of there.
- Get that thing out of there.
Right there, let's go.
Wait! Wait, wait, wait...
You will wait for me!
Wow, what are they teaching
the kid at that new school?
Oh, my God, look at this.
Holy sh...
I know it's your dream
to play for the Sonics
but if that falls through,
you'd make somebody a good janitor.
Well, you told me to do my chores.
Honey, we are very impressed.
Here's five bucks.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna go take Marvin for a walk.
- Your homework to your satisfaction?
- Yeah.
Your room is nice and tidy?
- Guinea pig cage is clean?
- Yeah.
Well, I think we've done our part.
Now you do yours. Call Natalie.
In here?
Hurry.
I'll do it in my room.
He pooped twice.
- That wasn't me.
- I don't smell anything.
Get out! Everybody out!
Hello, Natalie. Guess who.
Hey, pretty lady. What's goin' on?
Dude. Natalie. How are you doing?
Hi, Natalie, it's Cody.
I was wondering
what you were doing this Saturday.
Hello?
Who is this?
This mission is screwed.
We spent $10million training this kid
and we did not teach him
how to talk to a girl?
Sir, I assure you, we had no idea.
- You're shy?
- Cody's a little delicate.
My mother's ceramic cat
collection is delicate.
- This is national security!
- I'm sorry.
On the training program
you bragged about having lots of girls.
It was camp. I exaggerated.
Everyone does.
...to Quad Seven. Agent Raymond...
OK, so...
What is the truth?
When it comes to girls, I suck.
You met my dad. Well, I'm his son.
Ladies and gentlemen,
somebody has got to teach this kid
how to talk to a girl!
I understand you're having a problem,
so I've assembled a team of experts
here to help you along
from the point of contact
to the point of closure.
You got to close.
Any species is predicated upon mating.
Males and females must couple
or the animal will surely die off.
- I'm just trying to get a date.
- This is how the hyena does it...
- See this thing here?
- There's a lot of laughing involved.
It makes you wanna give the good Lord
a standing ovation.
You gotta let her know she looks fresh. Pay
her compliments.
Be smart. Get some dirt on her, eh?
They use both sides of their brain
at once-emotion and intellect.
- Check out previous boyfriends.
- Pick her up, don't be late.
- It's a bad way to start off a first date.
- My grandfather used to say,
"Women are like cow chips, the older they
get the easier they are to pick up."
Let's take a few deep breaths
as we turn to the relationship pyramid...
Forget all that,
you gotta be stern, commanding.
- He's dead now.
- Shower before seeing the girl.
No, no, you wanna be dank, dusky
and musky. She's got to smell you.
My father was married 100 years or so.
You gotta smell like a savage beast!
Pull the ring in the back of his neck
and he goes, "My fault!"
- Like a wild animal, the cheetah...
- Excuse me.
If you find yourself in a difficult position,
hang on, fight it out!
Hole up, get your energy back
for the final push!
Think like a hyena, be a hyena.
In the fog of war, it's the one who wants it
the most who wins.
And I don't think you want it the most.
I think you are a pathetic loser.
I think you're a disgrace.
How are you gonna hold your head up
high when you walk down Main Street?
- Straighten up when I talk to you.
- Thank you, General.
I'm sorry this had to happen.
This one's gonna be good.
Don't say I never did nothing for you.
Look at that.
Hey, Cody.
Come over here.
I'm free tonight, what shall we do?
Kid can't even talk
to a simulated woman.
Maybe I should've started him out
at a more intermediate level.
Wait, no, it's a little uneven.
A little... Up more on the right.
Are you OK?
Where did you come from?
I transferred from Jefferson High.
This will help. It'll make you feel better.
Could you hold this, please?
Nurse Hatchett
to the football field, please.
I'll be right back, OK?
You think it's broken?
- Definitely not.
- So, you're a doctor now?
Just experienced. I've broken my leg,
wrist, a couple of fingers...
- Let me guess, driving accident?
- Summer camp.
You know, one of those try and survive the
wilderness places. It's crazy.
I've only be to one summer camp -
for gymnastics.
They never told me you took gymnastics.
Who's they?
OK, that's it. I have to do something.
Sorry.
So, you do gymnastics. That's awesome.
Thank you for your help...
You know, you make
a really bad first impression,
and a terrible second impression
but the third time?
- It's really good.
- You gotta see my fourth.
I'd like that.
Listen, it's kind of short notice but...
I'm having a party this weekend and...
- I'd love to!
- Great.
Hello, I'm substituting for Miss Hatchett,
are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine,
I just need to go back to class.
- Glad this young man saved you?
- We don't need any help, Nurse.
I see here that your birthday
is coming up.
That's none of your business, "Nurse".
I'm gonna go.
Are you having a party? You should invite
Cody. Did you invite him?
- Yes, I did.
- You did?
Cody, I'll see you on Sunday.
The theme is Las Vegas.
All right, see you there.
Not a word. Not a word.
Be friendly but keep a low profile,
you're not there to socialize.
E.R.I.S. may have inserted agents -
casino dealers, catering staff.
Anyone is suspect.
And remember -
these are dangerous men.
They'll think nothing of harming you.
So use caution.
First floor of the house is a public area,
second floor is living space.
Down on the beach
is Connors' personal lab.
If you forget anything, the entire floor plan
is stored in your phone.
We'll only be a couple of blocks away.
Hold still.
That really freaks me out.
Sorry. Ready?
Yeah. Let's go.
Why don't you take it?
- You did get him his license?
- Yeah.
Here he comes.
He's at the gate.
- Name?
- Banks. Cody Banks.
- You got some ID, Banks?
- You mean my driver's license?
Yeah.
There were no guns at my birthday party.
- What's this?
- My cell phone.
My MP3 player. You know
these stuffy parties, they get boring.
Yeah, you have fun.
He's in.
We have to pass these out now.
I'm so over it.
That's what I'm talkin' about!
Guys, I'm 15, you know.
I'll see you later.
Sir? Another card for you.
- How's your ankle?
- Much better.
I better hold off
on the cartwheels for a while.
- You don't want to have too much fun.
- No.
Do you want something to drink
or anything?
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Wow, I love it, it's beautiful.
- Can you help me?
- Oh, sure.
Sorry.
I'm kind of new at this.
- Turquoise is my favorite.
- I know.
- You're not supposed to know that.
- I know!
What?
Sorry, just this stupid voice in my head.
I have to go play hostess.
I'm not surprised
to see that you're the first...
Don't ever interrupt me again!
If you don't watch it,
you're going in next.
- It won't happen again, I promise.
- Yeah, right.
Place your bets.
No more bets.
Red seven.
Thank you.
Sir, it's just play money.
Guys?
Brinkman.
This way, Mr. Brinkman.
- Let's see what they're up to.
- Wait till it's clear.
I'll be OK, I'm going down.
- I'm on the roof of the lab.
- Be careful, it's full of motion sensors.
I hope you haven't spent
all our money on real estate.
