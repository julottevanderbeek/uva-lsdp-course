sportscaster :
pitch to hatteberg.
strike ball over the
outside corner, at the knees.
appeared a llittle upset with the call...
by the home plate umpire,
but deferred to say anything.
...
...the last half of the ninth inning.
the boston red sox, six,
the t oronto blue jays, four...
...
...
hey.
woman: hey.
morning, dr. fowler.
morning, natalie.
how you doing, boys?

hey, duncan,
sure you don't want to go?
nah.

no, he wants to stay here.
scootch up. get in the middle there.
come on.
bye, dr. fowler.
- bye.
- bye.
: you don't want...
to wave good-bye?
you don't want to wave good-bye?
...
sweetie, what do you want for breakfast?
cereal.
sportscaster:
the weel red sox radio network.
announcer: you've been llistening...
to 'red sox replay.'
wqss-camden's repeat broadcast
of boston red sox baseball...
has been brought to you...
by george c. hall & sons of rockland...
in business in mid-coast since 19...
...
...
there you go.
...
...
oh, boy.
you see what happened to this poor fella?
what?
well, look. he lost an arm.
see, the trap has nylon nets,
called 'heads'--...
two side... side heads
to let the lobster crawl in...
and inside,
what they call a 'bedroom head'
to hold the balt
and keeps him from escaping.
now, you know the old saying...
'two's company,
three's a crowd'?
well, it's like that.
you, uh, get more than two
of these in a bedroom...
and chances are something
like that's going to happen.
that's why frank can't leave these traps...
for more than a day.
dad, show him this one.
now...
the older females,
like this old gal...
they're the most dangerous...
especially when they're growing berries.
'berries'?
yeah, eggs.
you see?
she can take out two males,
no problem.
that's when you get a lobster you can't sell.
but this fine lady,
she, uh, she has it easy...
'cause the state says we have to let her go.
...
okay, now...
you think you can handle this?
mm-hmm.
are you sure?
mm-hmm.
okay, go ahead.
put her in the tank.
higher. higher.
- higher.
i'll swing you higher.
like that?
...
is that high enough?
duncan: yep.
aah, ruth hates these.
what?
i got the wrong kind of buns.
maybe we can borrow hers.
two.
okay, you've had a lot, huh?
here, sweetie.
ah, what i would give
to have back my youth.
yeah, well, willis, you never
had that in your youth.
: you can go play.
sportscaster: tony batista...
with that most unusual stance
away from the plate.
hey, father, you made it.
if i don't get to see you fellas here...
i don't get to see you at all.
hey.
hey.
you want a beer?
no.
i'm going to go see...
if your mom needs any help, okay?
all right, good luck.
- yeah.
...
excuse me.
can i help you with anything here?
oh, yes. uh, you can hand me
that bowl, dear.
great.
uh... this one... here?
yes. thank you.
...
i'm looking forward
to that concert on labor day.
the music's so unusual.
it's haunting, really.
it is, isn't it?
mmm.
how did you...
learn about that...
uh... style?
at brown.
uh-huh.
i did my thesis
on eastern european folk music.
oh, i thought about becoming a teacher.
well, why didn't you?
mommy.
yeah? what are you eating?
nothing.
is it good?
yeah.
...
swing me. swing me.
okay, i'll swing you, dunc.
i have... i'll be right back.
go ahead.
so, mr. strout mentioned you again.
i'll bet he did.
he still talks about you.
says you're the best can-packer
he ever had.
yeah?
says you looked real cute in that hair net.
excuse me, boys. an offering.
here, father.
thank you.
so, uh, that's what charies senior's doing...
and, uh, becky went
to the hairdressing academy...
after high school.
of course,
after she got married...
she decided she wanted...
to stay home with the boys, you know.
she still loves doing hair, though.
where do you go, father?
i just go to supercuts.
wha...?
you can't request
the same girl at supercuts.
dad: I tell you...
those boys are having a great time.
it was good of you to do this for them.
well, she hasn't brought them before...
because she's embarrassed.
she shouldn't be embarrassed.
i wish you hadn't put up that monstrosity.
we're just going to have to take it apart...
when they leave.
what, the swing?
the swing.
oh, ruth, he's a kid.
what do you expect?
'happy birthday. here's a box.
drag it around for a while.'
he's a kid.

no.
it's okay.
...
i'll, uh...
i'll see you later, then.
okay.
a little while.
oh...
ruth: she's not divorced yet,
you know.
matt: it's the same thing.
maine has crazy laws,
that's all.
anyway, he loves her boys.
oh, god, you don't think he wants to...?
no, he's not going to marry her.
well, then what's he doing with her?
she probably loves him.
girls always have.
let's just leave it at that.
...
well... he won't listen to me.
i've asked him three times...
to dismantie that swing set.
oh, leave it up.
looks like a young coupie lives here.
...
well, he needs his head in school...
not in her.
so to speak.
...
: ow.
it would help if you were on my side.
oh... i can be on your side.
...
i've got a needle.
here i come, ready or not.
come on.
: i've got a needle.
you don't need those.
...
mr. and mrs. adamson?
okay, you can put your shirt back on now.
yesterday, he was up and around
all afternoon...
but today he tumbled.
he's fallen twice.
i have all i can do to get him up.
he's weak.
said when he couldn't work no more...
he didn't want to live.
so, for a while,
he sat and just mended our nets...
but he can't do that no more.
how's your dad, matt?
oh, i'm sorry, doctor.
now, elwyn, you remember,
jesse fowler passed away...
a while ago.
we were at his funeral,
remember?
...
uh, back in an hour, janelle.

starting to become a habit.
you just missed him, matt.
he went home for lunch today.
oh, right.
i forgot, he's got an interview.

duncan: mom, i want to play.
natalie: all right, you'll play, too,
but first, we'll watch him.
hey, frank...

how good what was?
aw, frank had quite a time this afternoon.

jason.
: jason.

she's such a brave girl.
that's it.
you're driving me nuts, ma.
i've had lots of girlfriends...
and i don't understand
why this one is any different.
i know you don't.
we're not serious, ma.
no?
no.
it's a summer thing.
mmm, i see.
...
how'd you get in this time?
chimney.
thank you.
what can i help you with?
i was just dropping that off for jason.
what?
that.
i didn't know where you'd want to put it.
it's about time he got it.
what am i going to do with it?
it is really going to mean a lot to him, rich.
he's really been improving lateiy.
yeah, so i heard.
it would have been nice
if you'd come to his game.
i just got your message.
where are they, with him?
that's none of your business.
i see-- they're my boys...
but they're none of my business.
you know what i mean.
yeah.
...
i was thinking about moving back...
here... with you and the boys.
what are you talking about?
what am i talking about?
i'm talking about moving back...
is what i'm talking about.
i know what you're thinking.
it's different now.
yeah?
yeah.
how's the job?
your father take you
back on at the cannery?
that's funny.
still getting checks,
aren't you?
or do i have to call my father's accountant?
hey, did you see my new rig out there?
it's really nice.
it's not exactiy new.
i traded david the truck for it.
it's got room for all of us.
good grocery-getting car.
you want to take a ride?
gee, rich, you don't change.
you don't change, do you?
change? no.
no, i don't change.
everything around me changes.
you change.
you take my house...
and you take my kids...
and you fuck this other guy...
but me, i don't change at all.
it's not your house.
oh, really?
no. as far as...
: fucking goes...
who was it that answered
the phone the other morning?
she was just...
it doesn't matter.
i don't care.
it's not working.
nat, i just want a chance.
for what?
so they can pretend...
they have a real father for a few days, and...
i am their real father.
i am their father.
no, richard.
you know what defines a father?
it's what he does.
not what he promises.
it's being a positive,
conslistent presence.
...
a positive,
conslistent presence.
wow.
what does that mean?
i just don't get it.
but i'm not fucking a college boy, am i?
look... you... uh...
can you just go now?
i don't want you here when they get back.
oh, you wouldn't want that?
no.
- no.
no, you have to leave now.
okay.
i'll see you later, richard.
yeah. good-bye, nat.
hey...
you know, i've been ignoring
our difference in age...
but you keep playing with those blocks...
i'm going to start to worry.
you're not looking at the house.
look.
it's not all mine.
it's part mack.
see, the whole idea
of what mack was trying...
to achieve was a common area
in the center of the house.
i mean, large open spaces--
they weren't unique to mack...
but the idea of separating the family...
so that the parents were on one side...
and the kids are on the other, so...
they'll all spill into the center.
it's brilliant. it's....
i'm boring you, aren't i?
no.
mm-mm.
i was just thinking.
about what?
about you.
school.
what if i wait a year?
frank...
a year is not going to make...
no, you can't do that, frank.
why not?
i've thought a lot about this.
i have, and....
no. you...
you told me it takes forever...
just to establish yourself.
exactiy. so what's a year in forever?
that's twisted logic.
...
do you know what duncan
said to me today?
oh, you wouldn't be changing
the subject, would you?
he said,
'frank, i don't think jason...
really understands girls.'
oh, he didn't.
he did.
...
'understands girls.'
well, what'd you say?
i didn't know what to say to that.
i said... i said,
'give him time, duncan.
he'll come around.'
if this is how he is now,
then we're in trouble.
what is this, action man?
yeah. richard gave it
to dunc for his birthday.
...
very good.
okay, it's 7:30.
we should stop now.
now remember...
when you sing these words...
the way we feel about the harbor...
is how the balkans felt about the river sava.
and listen to your tapes.
'mollih ta' is still very rough...
and we've got a 40-minute program.
to have ready by labor day.
Iabor day.
oh, and anna?
yeah, ms. fowler?
next time, duck.
yoo-hoo.
yeah. great.
: dad...
is that acid?
what are you putting in there?
oh, my god.
what happened?
matt: come on, frank. hold still.
all right, dad.
this was her husband, wasn't it?
ex. he dropped in.
you going to press charges?
no.
well, what's to stop him
from doing it again?
did you hit him at all?
come on, tell me tell me you hit him.
matt.
just so he doesn't do it again.
i don't think i touched him.
aah. jesus. dad.
so what are you going to do?
take karate.
oh, that is not the problem.
mom, you know you like her.
i like a lot of people, frank.
what about the boys,
did they see it?
no, they were asleep.
did you leave her alone with him?
he left first.
she was yelling at him.
i believe she had a skiilet in her hand.
oh, for god's sakes.
did you call the police?
not yet.
you didn't call them?
well, i just got in.
where's the phone book?
when did i have chance to call the police?
no, mom, no, don't call them.
if you call the police,
they'll come over...
and scare the kids.
- matt...
we got to call them.
no, we're not calling them.
it was a scuffie. that's it.
it wasn't serious.
oh, right, just like the
relationship isn't serious.
oh, ruth.
now is not the time.
well, when is the time...
after he knocks him into a coma?
this is stopping now.
oh, really?
come fall, you're on a piane.
are you taking them with you?
what are the boys going to think...
when you just disappear?
hey, easy, mom.
frank, this is not some
sweetie from vassar...
that you can visit on holidays.
you're not in this alone.
and the sooner you end it,
the better.
: oh, god...
what are we going to do?
i don't know.
well, you've got to talk to him, matt.
...
i don't know.
maybe he's right about scarlng the kids.
why don't we just sleep on it--...
deal with it tomorrow?
are you going to call
the police, or do i have to?
i just told you what i think.
if you want to call them,
call them.
...
it's not the first time...
she's played around, you know.
she's not with the guy anymore.
no, i mean from before.
what are you talking about?
oh, come on, you've heard
the same things i have.
you seem to forget.
i don't take my lunches
in the teachers' lounge.
maybe he still loves her.
...
best part of the cod.
the outsiders,
they won't touch it.
summer fishermen--...
well, they're part-timers like frank here--...
get in your hair.
as many as 80 of them now with licenses.
hmm. should've put up a sign:
'stay in your own backyard,
or lose your traps.'
see, henry here is just sore...
'cause i catch about
twice as much as he does...
with an old second-hand boudreau.
now, don't you listen to him, son.
that boat is fine.
she was my first.
i kind of miss her, sometimes.
and that truck you're driving.
when are you headed back
to school, frank?
hmm?
...
...
hi, dr. fowler.
how you doing, jason?
good.
what'd you pull?
not too bad.
about 40 pounds.
i haven't caught sight of you in days.
you know where to find me.
when are you coming home?
has it come to this?
come to what?
you having to run errands for mom.
i'm thinking of building
a coupie hundred more traps--...
see if i can do better than break even.
take you more than two years...
to get a iicense to fish off-season.
right. uniess henry takes me on
as his sternman.
you think he'd do that?
maybe.
it's as good a life as any.
it was good enough for your father...
and sometimes things
just skip a generation.
you don't think...
you don't think you might
need something more?
why...
so i can have an ivy league
education like you, and...?
christ, if it's so great...
how come you sneak
out of the office every day...
to come down here?
i like spending time with my son.
uh-huh.
i don't know, dad.
it's just-- i don't know.
she's a wonderful girl...
and that's what i see.
henry: hey, frank.
how long you gonna be parked there?
i'd like to unioad.
give me a hand?
yeah, sure.
you can't hypnotize...
the cards into changing, matt.
for chrissake, bet,
or you know carl's gonna start.
'the beggar's dog and the widow's cat...
'feed them and thou wilt grow fat.
'the gnat sings his summer's song.
'poison gets from slander's tongue.
'the poison of the snake and newt...
'is the sweat of envy's foot.
the poison of the honey bee
is the artist's jealousy.'
all right, carl. two bucks.
i'll tell you, man, you got
to get out of this blake thing.
you're in a rut.
don't get him started,
matt.

'whose hand is to be
laid upon him in honor.
'is the shepherd not joyful
beneath his trembiing...
'that he should wear the mark of the king?
'yet is he not more mindful...
'of his trembling?
'for what is it to die...
'but to stand naked in the wind...
'and to melt into the sun?
'and what is it to cease breathing...

...
they set the ball hearing yet?
uh, sometime in the next few days, yeah.
are you going?
uh... i don't know.
davis says it's a formality, really.
i haven't talked with ruth...
about whether or not
she thinks we ought to go.
if it's too much for ruth,
i'll come with you.
thanks.
uh, it'll be all right.
davis says it's a formality, really.
the criminal trial set yet?
uh, october.
october?.
that's what they tell me.
christ, they take their time.
well, he's in there now.
they're keeping him busy,
i'm sure.
you know where they'll move him,
once he's sentenced?
got any, uh, tabasco?
hey, anita. tabasco.
hey.
aw, shit.
next weekend, matt...
we really want you to come up to the camp.
katie's insisting.
not to pressure you or anything,
but if you don't come...
she's going to invite her
sister and that idiot...
and i'm going to wind up
insulting him again.
the future of my family is in your hands.
uh, let me ask ruth.
woman :
so the combination of spices...
is very southern, and i'll
tell you what makes it southern.
there are corlander seeds,
which i'm going to put...
...
in this cast iron skillet...
hi.
how was your day?
fine.
i had lunch with willis.
...about two tablespoons there...
it was really great to see him.
my day was fine, too, thanks.
sorry, did you say something?
you don't want to use too much of that.
just a little bit.
no.
...a quarter teaspoon.
uh...
katie and willis invited us...
up to the camp for the weekend.
i said i'd check with you...
in case we were doing something else.
once it starts roasting,
it doesn't take very long...
that sounds fine.
we, uh, we don't have to go.
you don't want to?
yeah, i want to.
then tell them yes.
well, i thought you might be, uh...
busy getting the girls ready.
no.
so i let it cool off very slightly...
okay.
put all the spices in one bowl...
when it's slightly cooled off,
in it goes, into the grinder...
all right,
the next matter is the matter...
of state of maine v.
richard strout.
the record should reflect...
that the defendant has been incarcerated...
in the knox county jail without ball...
since the 1 7th of july.
we're here for a ball hearing.
mr. davis, given the fact...
that we have a very
crowded trial calendar...
i'm going to suggest
that we do both the ball hearing...
and probable cause hearing today at 2:00.
so unless I hear any objection
to the contrary.
I'd like to set it for 2:00...
and we will take testimony
of your witnesses at that time.
natalie: i...
i closed the door.
i...
i walked...
through my room.
i heard some yelling.
i heard yelling.
heard yelling.
i got to the stairs...
...
and then i heard...
i heard the shot.
richard...
lawyer: i-i'm sorry.
: richard...
could we go back just a minute?
mrs. strout, you said you heard the shot.
yes.
you heard the shot?
did you actually witness...
the accident?
- objection.
your honor, there are no grounds...
to indicate this was an accident.
judge: sustained.
strike the word 'accident' from the record.
rephrase your question,
ms. keyes.
mrs. strout, in the police report you stated...
that you had witnessed
the firearm discharge.
did you witness the firearm discharge?
...
i thought you said there would be...
a jury trial sometime in october.
if he was incarcerated...
the judge would have set
an october court date...
basically to save the county...
the cost of housing
and feeding him as an inmate.
but, with bail, unfortunately,
the court date is always later.
you mean there's nothing
we can do about this?
you let that bastard just walk out...
and we're supposed to just sit here?
we can't appeal bail.
it's just not set up that way.
the state's ball code is to
ensure future court appearances.
now, in this case,
strout's family was prepared...
to put up a substantial
amount of property as ball.
that, along with his ties to the community...
made it very hard for us
to convince a judge...
that there was a serious risk of flight.
now, you can file...
a civil suit.
i recommend it.
but not now.
wait until after the criminal trial.
and when will that be?
well, honestly...
could be anywhere from...
oh, my god.
you're confident you can put him
away for good then, right?
the things she said in there...
what's the damage?
the way this is going...
potentially... manslaughter.
jesus christ.
he killed our son.
he-- it was no accident.
ruth, ruth, ruth... ruth.
uh... how long will he be sent away for?
well, that's hard to say, really.
anywhere from five to 15 years.
but we're confident that
we'll get the maximum.
- so even with good behavior
- five years?.
- he'll do ten full years.
- ten years?.
are you out of your mind?.
dr. fowler, mrs. fowler,
i'm sorry.
i understand.
no, you don't.
: no, you don't.
...
...
...
reporter: dr. fowler, what will...
your next step be?
matt: uh, i don't know...
reporter 2: dr. fowler, how do you feel...
about the result today?
matt: well, that's, that's...
something...
...
...
reporter 3: dr. fowler, have you had any...
contact with mrs. strout?
matt: no.
reporter 4: how's mrs. fowler handling this?
...
reporter 5: do you feel that justice...
has been served today?
matt: i think our legal system...
will determine that.
...
reporters: dr. fowler... dr. fowler...
matt: leave now.
reporter 2: any more legal action planned?
- can you believe this?
i ask those idiots to leave,
and no one budges, not one.
what are we supposed to do,
make them sandwiches?
what are you asking for?
what?
if you want them to leave,
tell them to leave.
okay, i'll tell them to leave.
good.
woman : and they never come up...
to the standard.
and so they're always and
forever disappointed. always.
they're never doing enough...
they're never working hard enough.
they never behaved right enough.
they were never a good enough father...
never a good enough husband.
and not only can they not
please themselves...
sad to say, most of the time...
nobody else can please them either.
you slept late... for you.
yeah, i took one of your pills.
you never do that.
mmm...
well, there it is in black and white.
you should read some
of the things he says.
it's unbelievable.
yeah.
well, i, uh, i better be going.
where? it's saturday.
oh, there's some stuff i have
to catch up on at the office.
i won't be long.
...
...
...
...
thank you.
do you want your receipt?
matt: natalie.
hi.
: hi.
i, uh, hope i'm not disturbing you.
uh-uh.
not at all.
could you break a fifty, please?
excuse me.
...
...
woman: thank you, dear.
could i possibly have another bag?
oh, sure.
...
...
yeah, well, i was just, uh...
just wondering how you're doing.
i tried to reach you.
oh.
um...
we're at my mom's now.
i wanted to call you.
that's... that's okay.
dr. fowler, i...
can't...
yeah, i-i-i-i know.
i didn't lie.
i didn't lie the first time.
it was...
it's how it came out.
...
...
...
: mrs. fowler?
no, uh...
man: can i get a pack...
of marlboro reds?
...
...
...
...
...
how are the boys?
they all right?
: yeah.
uh... i got to go.
i'll see you.
...
so how much of this is yours?
...
you ask me that every time.
you know the cove,
the other side of the cabin?
yeah.
all the way to the other shoreline.
aimost 350 acres.
know what it went for when i bought it?
no.
you don't want to know.
...
oh, and that's little charles
down at the pool.
he figured out how to
get down to the pool...
on the elevator, by himself.
oh, he must've been very proud.
oh, yeah.
oh, and that's shannon
waiting in line for--...
oh, my god-- that roller coaster.
you know the one?
oh, my god.
were the lines very long?
uh, yeah, yeah, sometimes.
unless, of course, you got...
the, um...
uh, fastpass.
...
what's the fastpass?
uh, well, you know, you got all
these different kingdoms there...
and, uh...
so you take this... fastpass.
it's kind of a laminated card.
you just put into a machine...
and it tells you when to come back...
so, you know, you don't have to wait in line.
you just go right in and...
you guys ever go to florida?
no.
how many grandchildren
do you have now?
um...
...
uh, well, all right, there's
little charles and shannon...
um, the three older ones...
and the babies.
: that's charles, shannon,
mary, george...
wendy, lee...
so, what, that's 11.
...
it must be wonderful.
willis always says...
'i guess there's no danger of us dying off.'
i'm so sorry, ruth.
i just wasn't thinking.
i wanted to have more, uh...
but we had frank and...
matt was just starting his practice...
so i guess it made sense.
little charles.
willis: only got half a cord...
of oak left at home.
and you know how much that
bastard daniels charges.
at least i can stack this up to the cabin...
have something to burn this fall.
katie: you know,
it's a wonderful product...
and they treat you pretty good.
on account of selling mary kay,
we got the new subaru.
well, the ride up was very comfortable.
it's a very nice car.
well, it's not really a car.
it's got four-wheel drive.
it's a little suv.
what is... the hell is all that 'suv' crap?
willis: sports utility vehicie.
it's a little jeep.
suv?
: 'atv' and 'kfc'...
what's with all these,
uh, these, uh...?
-acronyms.
- yeah.
i guess it's just too much trouble...
to say what something is anymore.
what does 'pms' stand for?
all right, i was an army brat.
i grew up with jeeps.
willy's... he's uncomfortable...
that i know more about one
masculine thing than he does.
only one?
-:
- oh...
thanks, buddy.
i like this guy.
you've done a nice job up here, katie.
don't tell me you made these curtains.
is that antique linen?
well, sort of.
they're pillowcases from our first house.
i've saved every knick knack...
and whim-wham we ever had...
you included.
willis: well... our timing is off.
...
...
willis: of course, he don't like working...
in recruitment, anyhows.
christ, they got them boys coming down...
to the office in the mall.
he gets them half-processed
and they decide...
they want to take
that 'delayed entry' thing.
christ, i couldn't do it.
katie: or they decide not...
to join up at all.
willis: like that one kid, there.
he had him all the way
through the works and... christ.
yeah... the boy's folks
called, uh, called david...
and said that the boy was...
he wanted out so bad that he...
well, he'd taken his own life.
something like that gets to you.
christ, i couldn't do it.
i'm going now.
okay.
are you looking forward to going back?
mm-hmm.
you look nice.
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
that was very good.
i goofed up a little bit, but...
...
ruth.
...
it comes in waves...
and then nothing...
like a rest in music...
no sound, but so loud.
i don't know what to do.
i... i feel so angry.
Iouise mcvey...
lost a child a few years back.
maybe you remember.
she had four.
it was the youngest, wasn't it?
yes.
she told me about a vision she had...
when she found out her daughter had died.
she saw herself at a great
distance from the earth...
and encircling it,
an endless line.
as she got closer...
she saw that it was made up of mothers...
traveling forward.
she fell into line and
began walking with them.
when they reached a certain point...
the line divided,
and she said she knew...
that all the millions of women on her side...
were the mothers who had lost children.
she seemed to find great comfort in that.
how did the little girl die?
a drowning, some kind
of swimming accident.
oh.
the name of the game is texas chase 'em.
henry: oh, geez.
willis: is there a problem?
why do you always delude
yourself with that crap?
what are you talking about?
look, we're not in vegas.
it's five-card draw or seven-card stud.
that's what i said--
five-card draw, jacks to open.
-carl?
- asshole.
...
i'll bet a buck.
raise a buck.
...
say something, for chrissake.
quit pussyfooting around me.
you want me to stare
at these cards all night?
'there are things of which i may not speak...
'there are dreams that cannot die...
'there are thoughts that make
the strong heart weak...
'and bring a pallor into the cheek...
'and a mist before the eye...
'and the words of that fatal song...
'come over me like a chill:
''a boy's will...
''is the wind's will...
''and the thoughts of youth...
are long, long thoughts.''
okay, you got the two.
willis: i'm in there.
i'll take one.
willis: okay, you got it.
i'm going to need--
oh, i need them all-- three.
make them good.
...
you look very pretty.
you know where we're going tonight?
it's a surprise.
...
...
...
matt?
...
...
...
...
ah.
...
...
...
sportscaster :
atianta one; red sox nothing.
from the stretch, martinez.
still one and two on jordan.
he's hit 13 home runs.
he's got a teammate at third with two down.
ramon martinez gets the sign,
checks the runner at third.
comes to the belt and to the plate.
a swing and a bouncer up the middle.
nomar fields it,
gloves it, throws to first.
inning over.
they leave a man in scoring position.
jordan's out-- six to three.
good effort in that inning
by ramon martinez...
against a tough hitter.
after two and a half innings,
atianta one, red sox nothing...
on the weel red sox radio network.
matt: no.
i'm sorry,
that's totally unacceptable.
yeah, so what did he say?
he... no, we can't allow that.
...
hold on a second.
excuse me, matt.
ryan collit's out there.
his mother just brought him in.
i'll, uh, i'll call you back later, okay?
yeah. yeah, okay.
i'll be back at 4:00, janelle.
okay.
woman: I'm sorry, dr. fowler...
but you just missed him.
thank you, carle.
no, i really need to see him.
he go to lunch?
that's right.
he's across the street.
thank you.
that's what they do, you know?
oh, hey, matt.
hi.
have a seat.
thank you. thank you. i...
this is my assistant, jack.
oh, hi, jack.
- don.
- hi, don.
this is ed.
- hi.
- that's matt fowler.
so... how's everything going?
oh, uh, it's-it's-it's okay, you know, uh...
i just wanted to go over a
couple of things, and, uh...
you know, when-when
you've had your lunch.
sure.
we really are doing
everything we can, matt.
i promise you that.
yeah. what can I do, bill?
there's nothing, really.
look, it can't be manslaughter.
there's got to be something.
can't you find something,
you know...
like... like some piece of evidence?
i mean, that happens.
doesn't that happen?
we really are doing everything we can.
i'm not going to lie to you--
all we've got is strout.
he claims that there was a struggle.
forensics can't determine
if there was a struggle...
because of the condition of the house...
when frank got there.
the best thing for you to do is...
just sit tight.
now, we haven't thrown in the towel yet...
and you shouldn't either.
we've still got two investigators...
working on this case.
: it's still a priority...
case for us.
we've got leads we're following up on.
...
we still got a lot of things to do, here...
before we wrap this up...
but we're doing the best we can
with the resources that we have.
you've just got to hang in there with us.
you have to have some confidence.
...
...
...
...
man: he takes these bats...
and nails them...
right on the wall above the scale...
because he knows bigmouth's
going to come in there...
and weigh his catch eventually,
you know?
he's putting the bats up,
one of the old-timers says...
'hey, ivan, what the hell are you doing?'
the old man says,
'sending a message'
and turns around
and walks out the door, right?
now, i walk in, there's...
these damn baseball bats
up on the wall, right...
with a big, huge note written
right across the front of them.
what'd it say?
'here's the bats,
if you got the balls.'
...
he never messed with our traps again.
hey, dr. fowler.
oh, hi, tim.
did he ever, uh....
does he ever talk to you
about what happened on that day?
no. no.
i don't even see richard anymore...
and he'd never tell me anything anyway.
believe me.
oh, sure, sure.
of course not.
i was just wondering if-if, uh, you know...
maybe you heard something
through the grapevine.
maybe, uh, maybe one
of his buddies said something?
no.
i was thinking--...
his brothers still work with you, right?
they must talk.
what i'm saying is,
if we could find something--...
just something concrete.
if you could...
it could be just, you know,
a slip of the tongue.
i'll keep my ears open.
thank you.
it's funny running into
you... here, dr. fowler.
yeah, well...
...
...
oh, i was hoping we could talk.
i...
i wanted to tell you how truly sorry i am...
and...
if there's anything that i can ever... do...
to-to...
talk with you...
oh.
...
...
man, better get back to the grind...
and don't steal anything.
hello, mrs. fowler.
will there be anything else?
i want a pack of marlboro lights.
sure.
that will be, uh, $14.95 with the cigarettes.
thank you.
...
matt: how did it go today?
something wrong?
wrong?
what could be wrong, matt?
what do you want?
i want to know what's going on.
oh, right.
you're obviously upset.
is there something we can talk about?
talk?
who, us?
what if somebody walked in?
they wouldn't recognize us.
they'd think they were in the wrong house.
do you want to talk or not?
oh, you mean about our dead son?
no.
we haven't before.
why should we bother now?
what can i do, ruth?
forget it, matt.
why don't you just go?
what do you want from me?
i want you to stop...
acting like nothing's happened.
that's what i want.
why, because i'm not
bouncing off the walls?
no, matt,
that would require feelings.
we don't want you to hurt yourself.
do me a favor, ruth.
you want a grieving contest,
go find someone else.
oh, i know how you grieve.
go have another beer.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
what do you know?
you know nothing.
you don't... you don't know
what i go through.
no, i don't know what
you go through, matt...
or if you go through anything.
but that's your choice, dear,
not mine.
you're goddamn right it is.
my choice is not to scream at the world.
maybe one of us has to be
reasonable around here.
you ever think of that?
reasonable?
gee, matt...
i don't know about you,
but i miss my son.
i'm glad you have time for reason.
that's what you imparted
to frank, that sense of reason.
...
oh, he thought you were very reasonable.
what are you talking about?
nothing.
are you...
are you saying that...
that i'm the one... responsible?
is that it?
well, uh...
well, let me tell you something.
let me tell you something.
you got it backwards.
...
i know what you think--
that, uh... that i was...
too lenient.
that i let him get away with...
everything.
everything.
yes, yes, yes, and why?.
why didn't he ever come to you?.
he wouldn't listen to me, matt.
no, he wouldn't listen to you...
he wouldn't trust me.
you made sure of that.
he wouldn't listen to you...
because you never listened to him.
no, but you did.
you were winking at him the whole time.
you encouraged him.
you wanted what he had: her.
oh, my god,
you've got to be kidding.
come on, you know it.
you wanted it and you couldn't get it.
that's why you didn't stop him--...
so you could get your kicks
through your son.
you can't admit the truth
to me or to yourself...
that frank died for your
fantasy piece of ass.
: oh, y...
you know, y... you want to know
why our son is dead?
you really want to know?
he was with her not because of me.
he went there because of you.
yes, he did...
because you are so...
controlling...
so overbearing...
so angry that he was it...
that he was our only one.
that is not true.
oh, yes, it is. yes, it is.
even when he was a kid...
you were telling him
how-how he was always wrong.
oh, i remember...
one time you yanked him
out of a little league game...
and sent him home...
for throwing his-his glove in the dirt.
he was what?
nine years old?
everything he did...
was wrong.
well, what was wrong with him, ruth?
you're...
you're so unforgiving.
you are.
that's what he said.
and you're pulling the same shit with me...
and that's a horrible way to be.
it's horrible.
you're bitter, ruth...
and you can...
point your finger at me all you like...
but you better take
a damn good look at yourself.
i just wanted to talk
about what happened, matt.
...
you want me to be open with you,
embrace you?
you scare me.
how can i talk to you?
sometimes i...
sometimes i can't even look at you.
...
no, god.
...
...
that's probably the police.
hi, there. i'm krlisten gellar...
from the rockland gymnastics association...
and today we're selling brand-name candy.
each purchase is matched
by the tandy corporation...
to help us meet our goal
of traveling to oahu...
to compete in the east/west conference.
uh, okay, i'll, uh...
i'll take some.
oh, and today we have a special.
six bars for $10.
okay, i'll, uh...
i'll, uh, i'll do that.
should i hold something?
yeah. could you hold this?
yeah.
thank you.
okay, there's...
there's the... the $10.
thank you.
- uh...
- here.
okay, so i...
you can pick anything you want.
any six is...? okay.
ruth...
what i said just now...
i, uh...
i-i had no right.
uh...
no one...
no one should ever have to hear
stuff like that.
i'm so sorry.
...
it's okay.
no. you're right, matt.
i am horrible.
please, please, please don't.
i don't blame you.
it's just...
that girl came by the school...
and i couldn't forgive her...
and i was...
i was so...
i'm sorry.
i've been so...
i've been so angry.
that's okay.
it's just...
i've seen him,
and i keep seeing him.
i know. i...
i know.
in his room, you know...
sometimes i can swear he's there...
and, uh, today, at a stoplight...
i could've sworn frank...
not frank.
richard.
: and i don't know what to do.
ruth... ruth... ruth...
uh... where-where did you see him?
everywhere. downtown.
at the market.
i saw him...
i saw him at south end.
he smiled at me, matt.
i keep running into him.
he smiled.
...
oh... it's okay.
it's okay, it's okay.
...
...
katie: honey, are you...
coming to bed now?
soon, baby.
matt's still here.
oh. well... well, hi, matt.
uh, honey, when you come to bed...
would you bring me my pills?
um, they're on the,
uh... top sheif...
from when the kids were here.
all right.
all right, thanks, dear.
matt: I never thought about bail.
i thought i wouldn't have
to worry about him for years.
you know what i heard?
he's tending bar up to old orchard beach...
for a friend.
you ever notice even the worst
bastards have friends?
well, nobody knows him over there.
if they do, they don't care.
they drink what he mixes.
i hate him, matt.
my boys went to school with him.
he was the same then.
you know what he'll do?
five years at the most.
yeah, i know.
remember that woman
about seven years ago?
shot her husband and dropped him
off the bridge in the st. george...
with a 100-pound sack of cement...
and said the whole way
through it nobody helped her.
you know where she is now?
where?
she's up to searsport now,
a secretary...
and whoever helped her...
where the hell is he?
it'd break my heart, matt-- it would--...
but you ever think about just...
moving away?
yeah, we have.
it wouldn't matter.
yeah.
...
...
...
...
...
...
richard: let me lock the place up.

sportscaster : let's see,
the last red sox player...
to have a three-home-run game
would have been trot nixon...
last year at detroit.
nomar had one previous to that.
off with a fast ball. ball one.
galarraga holds.
against daubach at first.
the outfield swung around to their left.
and a ground-ball roller to shortstop.
flip to second; they force daubach.
actually hit into a force play
to end the inning.
the inning is over.
red sox have left seven.
after six, the red sox seven,
the braves two...
on the weel red sox radio network.
...
...
sportscaster :
...hit the scoring run, there,
one for two.
six for ten with a home run,
three rbis in the series.
hits one into the air...
turn around.
why?
we missed it. turn around.
okay.
that's like using a rolled-up newspaper...
for that hit.
sanders is up.
homered his first time.
one for two.
his fourth of the year.
...
pitch... he'll throw a strike
with a knuckleball.
there's nothing back here,
dr. fowler.
i don't understand...
why we don't just drive to the airport.
you don't think we'd leave
your car at the airport, do you?
knuckieball over the inside
corner for strike two.
i'll get 20 years, dr. fowler.
i'll be 53 years old.
that's a year younger than i am now.
here's the pitch.
inside. just missed.
the crowd groans.
where are we?
almost there.
