TIE ME UP / TIE ME DOWN
Go see the director
when you're finished.
Will do.
Come in.
Hi.
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Sit down.
The judge...
says you're free to leave now.
He thinks you may join society
as of today.
Great!
No need to run away again.
You're free, Ricky.
Freedom...
also means solitude.
I won't be there to protect you.
You'll have to answer...
for your actions
like any other citizen.
Don't worry, I'll manage.
What are your plans?
Get a job, a family,
like any other regular guy.
You're not a regular guy.
The judge says I am.
What does he know!
There are 50,000 pesetas.
It's for the drawings...
and the mad passionate moments
you brought me.
Thanks.
I promise not to spend them.
Don't be silly.
You'll need money
until you find a job.
There's a list of places
where you can apply.
Now go,
and don't ever come back.
I told you to leave!
First let me thank you
for everything.
Running away, are you?
The judge's letting me go.
I'm fit to join society.
Society...
I used to belong to society once.
It was a Gourmets' society.
They tried to poison me.
I'd be careful if I were you.
Come here, look.
Here.
It's free.
What is it?
The Society's membership card.
Cards are always handy.
- Any credit cards?
- None left.
I'm expecting a delivery.
Well, see you.
- How much is that?
- A fiver, honey.
- What's a fiver, Mom?
- Five hundred, darling.
Hi.
I'll be right with you.
Your change.
Good-bye.
- What will it be?
- The heart in the window.
- How much is it?
- Five hundred.
- My bus!
- Don't you want it wrapped?
"Barajas Studios"...
"Therapeutical shooting.
Marina Osorio."
Marina!
I'll take off my panties,
they show.
What's worse, showing your panties
or your twat?
Speaking of which...
I promised Maximo we'd do something
at tonight's party.
- Like what?
- Sexy but simple.
Like in the good old times
at the cabaret.
- I've forgotten how.
- Bullshit!
A little tit here,
a little tac there...
We'll kill two birds with one stone.
Both Maximo and the producer
will be thrilled.
Whatever you say, boss.
Marina...
I didn't tell you...
I'm so proud of you.
Silly!
Make it last.
- You lay it on too thick.
- I've got to lay something.
I better lean on them
if we wanna finish today.
We could sing that one.
Here's something for you.
Cool!
After my stroke,
half of my body was paralyzed.
So I thought I'd better hurry...
and do another film,
before the other half went.
Certainly.
Here I am,
doing my posthumous work.
But you look so alive
in your own electric chair.
I like that, electric chair...
- Sorry, I meant that--
- But you're right.
Since I've been stuck
in this chair...
I feel hornier than ever.
My wife says
I'm regressing into childhood.
She may be right.
After a stroke, you gotta learn
everything again...
how to speak...
to read, to write...
to dance but, above all...
that you want to keep on living.
Which, in my case,
means making movies.
What a lovely thing to say!
The knives...
The fake one.
- It doesn't even fool her!
- Sure it does!
It doesn't!
These props stink.
- What about the couch?
- Later.
- Later, when?
- Later!
Have you seen Marina?
How would you define
Well, I'd say it's a b-movie.
Aren't you worried about making...
your comeback with a b-movie?
I've always wanted to do one.
Marina!
But I'm afraid it's turning out
to be rather personal.
A personal b-movie?
How's that?
By putting one's heart,
and one's genitals on the line.
- You're known as a women's director.
- Genitals remind you of women?
No, but why choose...
a porn actress
who's known to be a junkie?
If you want
to get out of here alive...
don't mention the words
"porn" and " junkie" again!
- Hi, Maximo.
- Hello.
- Do we start shooting?
- The set isn't ready.
- How's your toothache?
- Not so good.
They still haven't brought you
an aspirin?
Carlos!
Wait! You'll wreck the set!
Come this way.
Jump! But careful,
you're very fat.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
I promise not to mention
"porn" and " junkie" again.
That's better.
- Who's she?
- A journalist.
- Which scene is next?
- My death.
How will you play dead?
Now that you mention it...
What kind of face...
do I have when he stabs me
on the couch?
Osvaldo!
Look! Like her.
- Osvaldo!
- Don't say "Osvaldo."
Don't say "Osvaldo."
Like this?
She's pissed.
Maximo, what scene do we shoot?
- The one with the phone.
- And then?
This is worse than a circus.
How can you concentrate?
As a kid, I used to work
in a real one.
It was a rodeo type of thing.
I had a lasso...
and some supposedly wild horses...
and I'd round them up,
tame them...
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, I am.
What did I say?
You tamed, lassoed and jumped...
And then, I'd line them up,
and walk on top of them...
striking poses, you know?
- And when I...
- Excuse me.
Come and tell me about it.
I ran around
in a little short skirt...
and my hair came down to my ass.
If I had been there...
Osvaldo...
Don't you recognize me?
- It's me, Montse.
- Boy! You're changed!
I gained a little weight
since we split.
- You've spread a bit too.
- I sure have!
Mind if I interview you?
- You're a journalist now?
- And you're an actor?
Kids, I gotta speak to you later.
- Okay, what's next?
- Wait...
something's cooking.
- Maximo, we gotta talk.
- Excuse me.
My boots!
The producer's wife likes the couch.
She wants it.
- So what?
- It might get splattered...
in the final slaughter.
Very likely.
It's hard stabbing a girl
without spilling blood.
- You better talk to him.
- He doesn't want any blood?
Sure he does, lots.
But not on the couch.
- I'll change the ending.
- You won't change a thing!
- I never liked it.
- You loved it.
I want to change it.
- You got the new dialogues?
- In a minute.
Look, I want you to make your movie.
Why should you compromise just because
her twat's dripping for the couch?
Forget it, Lola.
I've got a better ending!
Marina, you won't die.
I'll save you.
No stabbing?
Shit, I had gotten used to the idea.
So now what?
Can you stand your toothache?
Not really. Why?
It gives you the perfect expression
for the scene.
- As long as it's there...
- Thanks, love!
He'll be the end of my career.
He's the nicest director
I've ever had.
The trouble is,
he'd like to be even nicer.
And to top it,
you took off your panties!
- So what?
- He sees you...
gets inspired,
wants to save you...
and it all gets changed on me!
It's you.
No, I feel much better.
Yes, thank the police on my behalf.
Not today, better tomorrow.
I need to sleep.
Darling, I'm afraid
the whole future is ours.
Of course I worship you!
Tell me about the gruesome details
tomorrow.
Yes, I worship you.
Yes, love...
good-bye.
Get out of there.
I knew you'd come.
You knew even though
they told you I had died?
You wouldn't die...
without saying good-bye.
I'm not here to say good-bye...
but to take you away with me.
Where to?
To a very quiet place
where we can be happy.
What?
First take off your mask!
Show me your face!
I have no face.
Well, you have something.
I may as well get used to it,
if you're taking me away.
Do you really want to see it?
I do!
I can't.
Look at my body,
my body is alive...
but my face...
is that of a corpse!
You offer me death,
but death rarely brings happiness.
Cut! That's a wrap.
- Go help the actress.
- Hold on!
Nobody move!
My walkman and Osvaldo's money
are missing!
- The handcuffs too!
- And several props!
And my 10,000 pesetas!
No, not that, I took them.
Give it back and I promise
there'll be no reprisals.
I'm responsible for all this!
I'd love to take things too,
but I don't.
You've been divine.
- Who took the stuff?
- Relax, Lola...
the movie's done,
you won't lose your job.
- I guess so.
- Let's celebrate.
- Who was it?
- Let's have some champagne.
Yes, alcohol might loosen
some tongues.
Don't stare at me.
I'm not...
- I admire you.
- Well, don't.
What's the hurry?
I'm soaked.
What do you want?
No, nothing.
You wouldn't like it.
Don't tell me then.
- You'll come to the party?
- Sure.
Hi.
Sorry.
Can I speak to you for a second?
Not now, some other time.
Marina! Look! Look!
Look at me!
Look!
I won't eat them.
- You got keys to my place?
- Of course.
- You've lost yours?
- I can't find them.
- Try and use your head.
- See you, Marina.
By the way, I wish
you'd come to the party.
I can't. I don't want to.
I won't discuss it.
- Now what?
- My pay.
- Where's the car?
- Down there.
- I'll get it.
- Okay.
- What's its name?
- Paquita.
Like my niece.
Show me your hoof.
Poor baby! She's got a calk!
What's that?
An abscess.
- Better unshoe her.
- Who'll pull the cart?
If you don't,
gangrene will set in.
Make a plaster
with bran and vinegar...
stick it on sackcloth
and wrap her hoof with it.
Remove it 24 hours later,
and clean it with iodine.
And then, let it dry.
Right, Paquita? Tell them
they're taking advantage of you.
I mean it, she could die.
- Thanks a lot, miss.
- Bye, Paquita.
The young lady's right.
See?
Filled chocolates.
Maximo's too much.
- Who is it?
- Pepe, your neighbor.
Hi. Where are you going?
Somewhere far away to forget
that nightmarish film.
Well!
Give my mail to Lola,
she's got my address.
- Fine.
- Marina...
you were absolutely marvellous.
- Really?
- You bet!
I listened to Maximo
even when I didn't understand him.
You'll tell me your secret
when I get back.
- When's that?
- In a couple of weeks.
Enjoy yourself...
- and screw a lot.
- If I do, I won't come back.
What a one-track mind.
What is it, Pepe?
What's up?
Relax!
What's going on?
My keys!
Don't scream!
I warned you!
I warned her.
I told her not to.
Who are you?
Your attacker.
Does it hurt?
Damn!
Get out or I'll call the cops!
I didn't mean to hurt you,
but you started screaming.
Get out!
Man! This looks like a drugstore!
Bastard!
- You broke my tooth!
- I told you I'm sorry.
I bet you are.
You wanna fuck me?
Get it over with!
Relax.
We'll fuck when the time comes.
What do you want?
I'll tell you...
but let's lie down on the bed.
Watch out for the glass.
I tried to speak to you on the set.
You didn't listen.
I had to kidnap you,
so you'd know me.
I'm sure you'll get to love me
as I love you.
I'm 23 years old.
I've got 50,000 pesetas.
I have no one in the whole world.
I'll try to be a good husband...
and a good father to your kids.
You're the thief?
You ignored me.
You did the handstand.
Yeah, once in a while,
I'm a show-off.
Your face looked familiar.
We met before...
a year ago,
at a bar called "Lulu."
Remember?
I had run away from the hospital.
We met at Lulu's...
came to your place
and we screwed.
I said I'd come back
and protect you.
Many have told me that!
But I'm here to prove it.
Quit throwing things around!
Did you like the heart?
Not bad, huh?
She's a sweetie.
I don't get it,
you've taken four pills.
Painkillers don't work.
Why not?
I was hooked on smack.
When you're used to heroin,
painkillers don't do shit.
I had no idea.
Morphine would help,
or something.
Morphine?
Where would I find it?
The doctor who detoxed me
could give us something.
We can't go there.
Oh, God!
What would you say?
Meet a friend who kidnapped me?
- Of course I wouldn't!
- What then?
Nothing! I swear it!
She only lives three blocks away.
Please, I can't stand it.
I can't stand it!
I really can't!
Besides, it's your fault!
All right.
If you try to fool me...
I swear I'll do us both in,
got it?
Get dressed.
Go on.
You've got a pretty body.
Don't bother,
I hid all the blades.
Put some make-up
on your bruises.
I like being in the bathroom
with you...
like a married couple
getting ready to go out.
Marina, it's me, Lola.
Get the phone.
You're really something!
If we hold hands,
the handcuffs won't show.
- Who is it?
- My sister.
- What does she want?
- I don't know.
- Wait.
All right, darling.
See you tomorrow.
Gimme a drink.
- What?
- Let me see, a beer.
I may not like your face,
but your ass is another story.
- Maximo, for heaven's sake!
- Gimme a drink, Apache.
You've had enough.
Forgive him, Lola.
I'm drinking too,
and I don't mess with his stroke.
I want my drink.
Your ass and my stroke
are part of our culture.
That's true.
You were great, Lola.
- Thanks.
- But we miss Marina.
What's keeping her?
I just talked to her. That rain scene
made her toothache worse.
He told me all about it,
it must be lovely!
Sure, it's great hanging
under the rain...
like
Lola, please forgive...
my typically alcoholic aggression.
- You're forgiven.
- I can't stand your face...
but your tits
are something else.
It's true.
We shouldn't have come.
Don't say that.
- What if there's someone?
- She lives alone.
But she could have somebody now.
Come on! I'll ask her.
- It's me, Marina.
Are you alone?
All right.
How dare you?
Don't try anything funny, okay?
What is it?
You scared me.
I got a terrible toothache.
What an abscess.
The daddy of them all.
I'm glad it's just that.
- Hi, I'm Berta.
- Ricky. Glad to meet you.
Come on in.
I've taken four Fiorinals, but...
I warned you that the first months...
Watch the table!
It has a mind of its own.
After all you sniffed,
analgesics are useless.
Give me something.
Let me see...
How about Sosegon?
There's nothing worse
than a toothache.
- An earache is pretty bad.
- What about a colic?
- Never had one.
- Well, I have.
Listen, take it for a couple days,
no more...
you can get hooked on this too.
I know you, you're such a hog.
Isn't she?
Did she hit you?
- I bumped into something.
- What a pair!
Want a joint?
- No, thank you.
- No, thanks.
You look real uptight, Marina.
Take it easy.
- Why are you so nervous?
- I can't stand it!
It's too much.
Gimme something now.
A shot?
Dolantine should help.
Oh, dear!
You're a born dope fiend!
The babies woke up,
I'll go rock them.
- Don't, Berta!
- Why?
Hang on...
I'll go.
You don't mind?
He's so cute your guy.
You haven't taken anything?
You're acting real weird.
Show me. It's okay.
You hopheads are so...
- What cops?
- Shut up!
My babies!
Why did you pick them up?
I couldn't help myself.
My cuties!
Mommy...
Relax, love, the pain
will go away soon.
Ready, Marina?
Let's go, Ricky.
What are you looking at?
I'm here!
Don't fuck around!
- Let go of my hand!
- The handcuffs will show!
There's no one around.
- How can that be?
- Weekend, August, vacation.
The pain's gone.
I can tell by your face.
Want to buy the medicines anyway?
Gimme your hand and shut up,
all right?
- Someone's ringing.
- Let them!
I hear moans.
It could be an emergency.
A junkie most likely.
Goddamn motherfuckers!
Careful.
"No to rheumatism..."
Ma'am!
- What is it?
- We need some Sosegon.
I don't have any.
- Lady, this isn't a hold-up.
-Just in case.
We've got a legal prescription.
Call the doctor
if you don't trust us.
I don't have any.
Anything else?
Some tape.
- What for?
- Be quiet.
You can find Sosegon
in the Chueca Square.
- The drugstore's open there?
- What drugstore?
You buy it off the street.
You can find...
all the pills you need
on the black market.
- Wait, there's no rush.
- Don't push your luck.
- What is it?
- I don't wanna go inside.
- What do you want?
- I want you to let me go.
Impossible.
Be sensible.
Do you want another broken tooth?
We're going home.
Come.
Come on.
C'mon!
And now what?
I'll take off your handcuffs,
so you can get comfortable.
- What for?
- I'll go get those pills.
You lie down and wait for me.
Turn around, I don't want you
to see me naked.
Sure, sorry.
You don't happen to have some rope...
or something to hang clothes with?
What for?
This will do...
Not enough.
A rope, a cord, something?
What will you do?
Need anything?
Do you want to write, to chat?
Play a game?
- Call me if you need me.
- Okay.
Years ago, when a bullfighter
got top honors...
his fans would carry him home.
They'd wait until he came out
on the balcony...
to offer him a last cheer.
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.
I suppose because I'm close
to the balcony...
and I'd like for you
to be on the street...
and speak to me.
Marina...
It's me, Maximo.
My moustache will fall off.
- You got Sosegon?
- No, but I got hash and scag.
The chick on the bike
covers pills.
Thanks.
You! The one on the bike!
Got any Sosegon?
Don't shout, asshole!
Cool it.
I just asked if you had any.
- How many do you want?
- Don't know, a few...
My girl's got a toothache.
You got any dough?
Here's more.
Wait for me in the square,
I'll be right back.
- I told you to wait.
- Now that I'm here, gimme the pills.
- How many?
- Gimme all you've got.
What are you doing?
Bastard!
- What've you got there?
- What do you think?
If you show your face again,
I'll kill you!
It's me!
Look what I brought you.
I bet you'll like it.
She's out cold.
All right.
I'll untie you...
just so you don't think I enjoy...
making you suffer.
Let's see...here...
She's gonna wake up.
Wake up, don't wake up, wake up...
Careful not to touch her pussy...
That's it!
Don't wake up...
Don't wake up.
The gag...
Better leave it on,
she's got some mouth.
Well...
let's rest a little.
What a night.
The nights I've dreamt
of lying here with you!
Christ! What a hard-on!
I'll jerk off.
Kind of embarrassing
with her here though.
Nah, I'd better sleep.
What's up?
The pain's back.
And you thought maybe
the keys would help, right?
No, I took the stuff you brought.
Is that how you thank me?
You dumb shit!
Can't you see it's a trick?
That I was testing you?
How long before
you fall in love with me?
When will you see
no one's gonna love you like I do?
Poor thing.
It's more a love story
than a horror story.
It's hard to tell them apart.
We got a blockbuster.
- What's wrong, Lola?
- Nothing.
- You look worried.
- I got a hangover.
- Have a Bloody Mary.
- That's all I need.
Order one for me,
I need it.
- I'll order it.
- One for me too.
Okay. Anything else?
I'm off.
The mag stock.
Ask Marina to call me.
- What for?
- I need to speak to her.
I'm on my way to her place.
- Want me to come?
- No, better not.
Have her call me.
I miss her.
I'll tell her.
The washer's worn out.
Okay.
Breakfast.
What are you doing?
Hang on, wait.
- Sorry.
- I gotta piss.
All you have to do
is tell me.
And if you're gagged,
raise your hand.
Do you like the drawing I've made?
Turn off the tap!
I was trying to help.
- Listen to me.
- What?
I'll never love you!
Ever!
Don't say that yet.
I'll never love you!
Clown!
Who asked you to take care of me?
To protect me?
To be my husband
and father to my kids?
Who did?
And your 50,000 pesetas?
Keep them!
Spend them on someone else!
Bitch!
Does it hurt?
I'll go out and get
some antibiotics...
and a washer.
A washer?
Yeah, for the kitchen tap.
I have...
to tie you up a little.
Lie down, please.
Please.
Sit up, please.
- I don't like tying you up.
- Well, don't do it.
Shut up!
- Want anything?
- Some other tape.
This one's skinning me alive.
I'm very upset.
Think a little.
I know you got problems...
but try and put yourself
in my place.
How would you feel
after what you told me?
After all I did for you.
I've been mistreated,
but never that badly.
Anyway...
can't you try...
to be a little less selfish...
and think a little about others?
Nobody had ever called me a clown!
"I'll never love you, ever..."
Well, we'll see.
It's busy.
I'll deal with you later.
Marina! Are you there?
It's me, Lola.
Marina, please!
Paper ones, extra-porous ones
for sweaty people...
anti-allergic ones,
silk ones for parties...
- What is it for?
- You know, for the face.
This one with holes
sells pretty well.
- Is it for your scratch?
- No, it's for a girl.
This one's soft.
- It's fine. I'll take it.
- Anything else?
Yeah...some antibiotics
for a bad tooth.
An infection?
"Marina, how can you disappear
without a word?"
I've got a surprise.
I'll take the gag off later,
first the surprise.
Relax, it's a nice surprise.
- Well, how do you like it?
- I've been here before.
Careful.
That's it.
Aren't you scared
someone will find us?
That's why we moved,
who'd look for us here?
Ricky, I'm not as lonely as you.
I have a job, a family.
Sooner or later,
they'll look for me.
We'll leave soon then.
Your sister came.
I didn't want to tell you,
but we almost met.
I know!
Call her and tell her
you've gone with friends.
That way, she'll stop worrying.
You mean it?
I can call her?
Just to calm her.
If you try something...
I'll slit your throat.
And then my own.
Marina...
I got nothing...
so I lose nothing.
Don't touch it!
Don't mess with the pepper!
Give it here.
- Stop it!
- It's me, Marina.
-Just fine, and you?
- So so...
- Goddamn it! Let me be!
Your niece wants to know
who I'm speaking to.
Mom, tell Lola I'm not in Madrid.
I'll tell her.
I've gone to the country
to rest a little.
- What's for lunch?
Stop it!
What a brat!
I'll sure be glad when her mother
comes back and takes her away.
Anyway, there's "pisto."
"Pisto."
- It smells good.
- But I can't come.
Don't worry.
I'll put some in the fridge
for when you come back.
I don't have a phone here,
but I'll call you.
I'll be waiting.
I want to hear from you.
- I won't, Mom.
- Mom...
- I love you a lot.
- I will, Mom.
- Bye, Mom.
Next.
What are your plans for the future?
We'll get married
and have two or three kids.
- Two or three kids?
- Or more, if need be.
And how will you feed us?
I'll find a job.
We'll go to Australia,
they need people there.
But first,
we'll go to my hometown...
I haven't been back
since I was three.
- Does it still hurt?
- Yeah, kind of.
Can I help?
I don't know.
Maybe some horse...
- It would kill the pain?
- I'm positive.
- I'll go get some.
- Thanks.
Can you help me?
Don't you mind
if I see you naked?
I can manage.
A comfortable knot...
- Not too tight, please.
- This rope's the best.
So's the tape.
I tested it when buying it.
See you later.
Want it open?
You can watch the stars
while you wait.
Man, I think he's pretty worried...
about calling the elections.
I'm worried too, man,
I got plenty of problems.
Yeah, but if he ain't worried...
then we ain't got nothing
to worry about.
- You believe that crap?
- Yeah.
Hell, man, I'm working my ass
like a slave.
- But if he wins the elections...
- Got any smack?
No, but how much do you want?
- Don't know, the minimum?
- A 5,000 pesetas bag?
- All right.
- Wait here...
I'll go get it.
I'll be over there.
Wanna bang me for 5,000 pesetas?
What d'you mean?
I won't pay 5,000...
- 4,000, in case of herpes.
- It's not the money.
if I had to pay every time, hell!
My girl's got a toothache,
she's waiting for me.
So what?
He's the one who attacked me.
- The one with the moustache?
- Maybe he shaved.
Wait here.
- You're crazy!
- Maybe, but I ain't paying.
- So, we meet again?
- Do I know you?
Don't you?
You roughed me up last night!
After him!
I told you I'd kill you.
- What did you find?
- Subway tickets.
- 5,000 pesetas.
- Toothpicks. Gimme the dough.
- Nah. We split it.
- Like hell! He robbed me.
No, you don't.
Take his coat or screw him.
- I prefer his boots.
- Sold!
- Gimme the dough.
- What about me?
- You had your fun, sadist.
- That's true.
What happened?
I got attacked and robbed.
Even your boots!
- But why?
- I couldn't get your stuff.
Don't, I'll do it myself.
Let me help you.
Those animals!
- That reminds me of my parents.
- What does?
My Mom used to shave my Dad
on the porch back home.
It's all I remember.
- Does it hurt?
- Not at all.
Boy, what it's taken!
I don't know where to put my hands.
Wait, wait.
- Listen...
- What?
Should we do it?
- We can stop.
- No, no way.
The only thing the bastards
didn't touch was my cock.
I'll put it inside.
Don't pull out.
- Now I know.
- What?
I remember you.
I don't get it.
When you kidnapped me,
you said we had done it.
I said I didn't remember.
Well, now I remember all right.
That's more like it.
- Let's move up.
- Where?
- Up.
- Up?
Don't move. Stay inside.
- Does it hurt?
- I don't know.
Wait.
Don't move.
Don't come.
- Don't come.
- I'm not!
Don't laugh, it'll slip out.
Wait, don't move.
Stay inside.
Don't pull out.
- I didn't want to wake you.
- What's that?
A map of my life.
Show me.
Look.
Just imagine
my life's a subway line.
First stop:
orphaned at three years old.
Orphanage.
I escaped when I was eight.
Reformatory. More escapes.
- Mental hospital at sixteen.
- What a career!
There, I get on well,
and learn lots of trades.
Locksmith's the best,
breaking in and out.
So I ran away every so often,
but I always came back.
Why?
I had nowhere to go.
The director, she liked me.
That's why you're such a good lay.
With them, it was different.
- Were there many directors?
- No, but lots of nurses.
Now I understand.
Go on.
I escaped a year ago
and met you.
That stop changed my life.
All I thought about was you.
Thinking took up all my time,
and I stopped acting crazy.
The judge came over,
gave me a test...
and said I was normal.
They let me go.
End of the line.
- You.
- Me.
I can't leave her hanging there.
I need another scene...
or two.
Someone find Marina.
If it's a question of money,
I'll pay for it.
- With what?
- Money's not the problem, Maximo...
but everything has a limit.
Perfection's my only limit.
Do I have to remind you
of your duty as a director?
My duty is to warn you
the film has no ending.
Just add "The End."
I won't discuss it.
You're going too far!
I'll be in the bar,
meet me there.
Okay. Can someone grab the mags?
Thanks, love!
What's with your sister?
Why doesn't she phone?
Don't know!
I'll go see what he wants.
Yeah, hurry, he might not hire you
for his next film.
If you're doing it,
I'd rather direct traffic!
Enough, Maximo.
- What's he got against me?
- It's not you.
He doesn't want
to finish the film...
because he knows
it's his last one.
- I know he's unbearable...
- I'll say.
- He's fighting death.
- Yes, but...
Can't you tell Marina
to call him?
- Marina's disappeared.
- What do you mean?
I haven't seen her since the last day
of shooting. Nobody knows where she is.
- You two talked that night.
- I lied to you.
- Have you called the police?
- Well, no.
You see, the police...
Well, I prefer not to.
I see.
Move. Set the table.
Look.
Here's Granadilla, my hometown.
Not far from Plasencia.
I'll steal a car tonight.
Not with that face,
you won't!
I got balls.
You don't wanna go?
Not in a stolen car,
I don't.
We'll take a bus,
but we're going.
The pain's gone, right?
- My whole body hurts.
- We'll leave tomorrow.
It's your door.
You knew it! That's why
you didn't want to leave!
- I swear I didn't!
- You tricked me, you whore!
Don't hit me!
How could I know she had the keys?
You talked to Pepe!
You could have guessed it!
- Don't hurt Lola!
- Shut up!
I'll be right down!
Move your ass, lady!
I heard you!
She's gone.
No need to shout like that!
- I just went up to...
- C'mon, lady!
Don't push me,
or I'll stay double-parked!
- Like hell you will!
- Watch your language!
Take your damn hands off my car!
- I'm gonna burn it!
- You are?
- Maybe I'll burn you!
- Women!
I won't say what I think,
else I'd be saying it too macho!
We've got to go,
we can't wait any longer.
- Whatever you say.
- I'll go get a car.
- I've got a little money.
- We'll need it...
but we also need a car.
Okay.
Will you wait for me here...
or will you run away?
I don't know.
Better tie me.
Tie me up!
This will be the last time.
Shit! I forgot the damn radio!
Here it is.
I'm wetting my pants.
Weird...
Pepe? Is that you?
Come in.
- What happened?
- I got kidnapped.
Untie me.
- Kidnapped? But where?
- Here and at home.
Who did it?
Later.
He'll be back any minute.
The kidnapper?
Let's go!
You look awful.
Did you take any dope?
I'll get my purse.
What about all this blood?
I'm responsible for all of this.
My walkman!
Leave it,
I'll buy you another one.
I don't get it.
What is it, Marina?
- I love him.
- What?
- I love him.
- The man who kidnapped you?
You're crazy! Let's go!
How can you love someone
who ties you up?
Do you think that's normal?
It's probably the shock,
no one's that warped.
We'll go to the roof
and into the other building.
C'mon!
Hurry!
Hurry up, get inside!
How do you feel?
Fine.
I brought you
a sleeping pill. Here.
- Thanks, Lola.
- All right...
tell me all about it.
Don't you trust your sis?
- It isn't easy to explain.
- How did it happen?
The night of the party...
Pepe rang the bell
to say good-bye.
When it rang again,
I thought it was him.
- You shouldn't have opened.
- Yeah, but I did.
I started screaming and he hit me.
How terrible!
- He didn't mean it.
- Like hell he didn't!
When I regained consciousness...
he told me
he had kidnapped me...
so I could get to know him well.
He told me he was 23,
and had 50,000 pesetas...
that he had no one...
and that he'd be a good husband...
and a good father to my kids.
What a mess!
Eleven.
He can't hear you.
Go on up.
Ricky!
Marina!
You came!
With my sister. She wants us
to live with my family.
- Your family?
- And yours from now on.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Lola, this is Ricky.
- Hello.
- Here, this is yours.
- Thanks. Anything else?
Is that all?
Hang on.
- I'm sorry about all this.
- So am I. Don't let it happen again.
Mind sitting in the back?
- What about your car?
- I stole it.
I thought so.
Well, someone will take it.
By the way, there's never been
a thief in my family.
Come on! What about Dad,
may he rest in peace?
One was enough!
Marina says
you're a good locksmith.
That, a plumber, a carpenter...
- An electrician, a mason...
- Perfect!
I'll find you a job
in no time.
I suppose you don't mind
working, do you?
- I want to work.
- Good.
When we get home...
not a word about the kidnapping
to my Mom.
Don't worry.
Is the exam over?
Come on, gimme a kiss,
I'm not that bad!
You two sure had me worried.
Let's hear some music.
What is it, silly?
We get along just fine!
C'mon, baby!
