She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.
Care for a smoke?
Sure
l'll take one
Are you as bored by that crowd as l am?
l didn't come here for the party
l came here for you
l've watched you for days
You're everything a man could ever want
lt's not just your face,
your figure, or your voice
lt's your eyes
All the things l see in your eyes
What is it you see in my eyes?
l see a crazy calm
You're sick of running
You're ready to face what you have to face
But you don't want to face it alone
No
l don't want to face it alone
The wind rises electric
She's soft and warm
and almost weightless
Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes
That l'll save her from whatever
she's scared of and take her far, far away
Damn it, Hartigan, l won't let you do this
You're gonna get yourself killed
You're gonna get us both killed
l won't let you. l'm warnin' you.
Let go of my coat, Bob
You're draggin' me down with you
l'm your partner
They can kill me, too
l ain't puttin' up with that. l'm gettin'
on the horn and calling for backup
Sure, Bob
We'll just wait
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat gets
his sick thrills with victim number four
Victim number four
Nancy Callahan, age 11
And she'll be raped
and slashed to ribbons
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy
Take a deep breath, Hartigan
Settle down and think straight
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker
You ain't savin' anyone
You got a great attitude, Bob
Real credit to the force, you are
Eileen's at home waitin' for you
Think about Eileen
Heck, Bob,
maybe you are right
l'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense
You've been a very good girl, Nancy
You've been very quiet
Don't be scared
We're gonna be
taking you home really soon
But first,
we're going to introduce you to somebody
He's a very nice man
..light-hearted
and momentary digression
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure
For cheap thrills
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet -
temporarily remanded
to our custody though it may be -
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark
A single dent,
the merest scratch thereupon,
and the before-mentioned consequences
of which l so recently made mention
shall surely be athwart us
We're all done here, Benny
Let's give them some time together
Give them some privacy
Be with you in a minute, Lenny
l'm just making sure
they get along really well
And what kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?
You must be awfully scared now
But you've got nothing to be scared of
All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk
That's all. Just a nice talk
Just you and me
Don't you cry now
Roark
Give it up
Let the girl go
You can't do
a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan
You know who l am
You know who my father is
You can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying
Sure, l can
Cover your eyes, Nancy
l don't want you watching this
l mean it, baby
Cover your eyes right now
For God's sakes,
don't make it any worse
- Don't make me kill you
- Doin' fine, Bob
Never better
l'm ready to kick your ass
Sit down and stay down
l'll kill you if l have to
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.
Hey. Don't listen to him
he's a crazy man.
- What a tough man you are, huh?
- You stay right where you're at
You shoot your partner in the back..
then you try to scare a little girl
Maybe l'll pull my spare rod, plug you
a couple of times, show you how it's done
We could've worked something out,
but you've blown that
Sit down or l'll blast you in half
- You're so slow, you'll never stop me
- Sit down
You'll never be able to stop me
I want you.
l need you
Open up, police!
l'll be right out
Claire?
Now, don't worry Lucille,
l was just grazed
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way am l giving you any alcohol
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?
No
Go ahead
You're worse without 'em
Thanks
You're the best
Haven't seen you like this in a while
- Got in a fight with some cops
- Didn't happen to kill any of them, did ya?
Not that l know of. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure
How the hell do you suppose
l'm gonna square this with the board?
There ain't no squaring it
Not this time
This isn't some barroom brawl
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone
Hey, hey
this is big
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill
- Hey, there ain't no settlin' down
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days
They're back
There's no choices left
And l'm ready for war
Prison was hell for you, Marv
lt's gonna be life this time
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here
But l'm out now
lt took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it
But l'm out
l know exactly what l gotta do
looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me
- Leave your hands off Nancy.
That coat looks like Baghdad
So does your face
Take off!
He's new here, Marv
He didn't know
What'll it be, Marv?
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'
Sure, honey
You take it slow, now
Show's over, dickwad
Drink up
Now, that's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there
Your killin' days are over,
you over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch
l love hit men. No matter what
you do to them, you don't feel bad
- Take it off
- What?
Fine coat like that
and you're bleeding all over it.
All right, it's all yours
Oh, God!
lt wasn't you losers who killed Goldie
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing
So tell me, man,
who sent you?
l don't hear you giving me any names
So l guess when l shot you in the belly
l aimed a little too high
You keep holding out on me like this,
and l'm gonna have to get really nasty
lt was Telly..
Telly Stern passed me the order
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club
Thanks again
Bastard
You're gonna pay for what you did to me
Feel like talking, Louie?
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie?
How many for the kill?
lt was Connelly
He set me up
He'll never talk
l don't know about you,
but l'm havin' a ball
And what have been
your sins, my son?
Well, Padre,
l don't want to keep you up all night,
so l'll just fill you in on the latest batch
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em
You're speaking figuratively
When l need to find something out,
l just go out and look for somebody
that knows more than me,
and l go and l ask them
Sometimes, l ask pretty hard
By way of a ''for instance'',
l killed three men tonight
Tortured 'em first
You might say l been
working my way up the food chain
First two were minnows -
small-time messengers
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre
Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God
Just give me a damn name
- Roark
- You really are pushing your luck, Padre,
feeding me garbage like that
lt can't be that big
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox
lt's all there
Find out for yourself
And while you're at it,
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for
Amen
Goldie
lt couldn't be Goldie
l don't want to fight, pooch
l got no gripe with you
Easy, boy
Here we go
lt was you, you bastard
You killed her
You killed Goldie
lt was..
He keeps the heads
He eats the rest
- Lucille?
- lt's not just that wolf of his
The wolf just gets scraps
Bones
lt's him
He eats people
- He cooks them like they were steaks
- Let's get you warm
Just like they were steaks
Now he's got both of us
lt's all right
Take a nice, slow breath
Just look at the heads on the wall
The heads on the wall
The heads on the wall
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers
- He made me watch
- Oh, Jesus
He made me watch
Christ, l could use a cigarette
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department
Any leads?
One guy l talked to told me
it was Roark running the show
Whoever it is, he knew l was checking out
that hooker almost before l did
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over
The dead one
Goldie
l didn't know she was a hooker
Doesn't make any difference
about anything
- But l didn't know that
- She was high-class stuff
She must have shown you quite a time
Quiet
There's a car coming
Kevin
l'll see you later, Kevin
Let's go
They're done checking the house.
They're coming this way
Bastards
l'll show them
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv
No, don't shoot
Please
Listen to me
l'm his parole officer
He's unconscious and unarmed,
so there's no need to kill him
Captain, the target - there's no sign of him
Here's a sign
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing
You can't be Goldie
Goldie's dead
Goldie
Yeah, sure, right
l haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now
No wonder l'm seeing things
Bastard
He's crazy
Hit him again, Wendy
Harder
Wait a minute
Why did she call you Wendy?
Because that's my name, you ape
Goldie was my sister
My twin sister
l guess she was the nice one
Goldie and the other six - where are they?
What did you do to them?
You crazy goddamn broad
Just take a look at this mug
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?
None of you would, but Goldie
And she only did because
she thought l could protect her
And l'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy,
they showed up, guns blazing
But they didn't get me, and l've been killing
my way to the truth ever since
So, go ahead, doll
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way
Aw, nuts
OK, l'm glad we got all that sorted out
- What the hell?
- l tied those knots. That's my specialty
You sat there and took it,
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to
Well, sure. l thought l might be able
to talk some sense into you
And l probably would have had
to paste you one,
and l don't hurt girls
l need a pair of handcuffs
What style do you want?
l got a collection
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail
lt was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and l don't know why
l know that sounds crazy
No, it doesn't
Goldie worked the clergy
Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing...
and a spool of razor wire...
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire
Beefing up the old home security, huh?
You can bet your ass
She was my sister,
so l'm in this one to the end
But why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?
She was nice to me, gave me
something l didn't even know existed
l wasn't never even able to buy a woman
You know, the way l look
- We're close enough. Pull over
- Yes, Marv
Keep the engine runnin'
lf l'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back
Kill him for me, Marv
Kill him good
l won't let you down, Goldie
Come on, you son of a bitch
ls that the best you can do, creep?
l got you, you little bastard
Let's see you hop around now
Let me do it, Marv
She was my sister. Let me finish him
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy
Oh, but l want to..
God, l gotta tell you, l'm good and bushed
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either
lt's all that sawing and tying
lt's not as easy as it looks
Could have been a real mess around here
if l didn't have that tubing for tourniquets
l gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,
to get the scent in the air,
to get that friend of yours to come running
Well, what do you know?
Look who's here
Here he comes
That's a good dog
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?
Sure, Marv
Who's the babe?
So, what do you want me to do with her?
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks
What about you?
Are you leaving town?
Hell, no
l like it here
I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.
Quiet as a grave out here
No sign of target
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways
The dog ate the rest
Oh, my God
You monster
You demon
Don't scream or l'll plug you
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore
lt's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while l'm around
When he came to me..
he was a tormented boy
Tormented by guilt
l tried to counsel him
But the eating - it filled him with white light
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty
What the hell do you know?
l know it's pretty damn weird to eat people
He didn't just eat their bodies,
he ate their souls
And l joined in
They were all whores
Nobody cared for them
Nobody missed them
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything
Who would believe a thug like you?
And now he's dead and you're here to...
...eliminate me.
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?
Killing a helpless old fart?
The killing, no
No satisfaction
Everything up until the killing will be a gas
Kevin,
we're going home
You can scream now if you want to
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God!
Ahh Jerks. They should've shot me in the head,
and enough times to make sure.
l got 'em for you good,
didn't l, Goldie?
l'm sorry, Wendy,
l got confused again
Just seeing you like this
You can call me Goldie
''Yea, though l walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...''
Would you get a move on?
l haven't got all night
You heard the man
Hit it
ls that the best you can do, you pansies?
He's gone
Forget it, man
You can bang on that door
all night if you want to
There is no way in hell l'm letting you in
l can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie
Everything we've shared -
it has to mean something to you
lt meant plenty
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises
l know you're angry, baby
And l forgive you for that
without you even asking me to
There's a difference
between getting honked off
at a guy who's generally not so bad,
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often
Especially the kind of total jerk loser
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man
That hurt, Shellie
lt's one thing for you to play hard to get,
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off
l am impossible to get
Do yourself a favour, Jackie Boy,
and get help, like a shrink
Get help and get lost
Just open the door
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie
l'll take care of this
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me
Oblige him, Shellie
l'm ready for him
No! lf he knew that you were here with me,
you don't know how bad this could get
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall,
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is
Hey, l could swear l heard somebody
in there with you just now
Somebody! Jackie Boy,
it's a regular African love fest in here
- l'm no racist
- l mean, l got me all five starters,
and half the bench of
the Basin City Blues keeping me company
You feel like taking them on?
You are teasing me, baby
Some of my best friends..
But you're really pushing my buttons,
and the whole time
you've been doing me like this,
l've been too polite to point out
that at any time l want to,
l could kick this damn door to splinters
OK, baby, you know what l can do
- You know what l can do. One, two..
- All right, then
All right
All right, all right
Troops, make yourself at home
You brought your whole pack with you?
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?
You're gonna love this, baby
You're gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,
and it's gonna be great
l ain't calling up nobody
That's a man's shirt,
and l'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine
You got somebody's love stink all over you
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight
- Who is he?
- He's Superman
He flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming,
cos you scared him so bad
You think l have no feelings at all
lf you're gonna slug me,
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard
There you go,
lying about me again,
right in front of my friends
l have never hit a woman in my life
That's showing her, man
You goddamn bastard
You goddamn coward
- Baby, we're all here to have a good time
- Yeah
l gotta take a leak
Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy
Then you could've met my boyfriend
Could've seen what a real man looks like
There you go, after my nuts again
But l forgive you
l'm a generous guy
He is generous
But that temper of his..
You never should have
picked on him like you did
My temper you don't have to worry about
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or l'll cut your little pecker off
Ooh, l've been told
Hey, baby,
l don't hear you making those calls
Answer me
Oh, l don't need this grief
Hi. l'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and l'm out of my mind
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again,
you even think her name,
and l'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman
You're making a big mistake, man
A big mistake
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself
You didn't flush
Troops, get outta here
No questions, damn it
No questions
Now
Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?
l just gave him a taste of his own medicine
l don't think he'll be bothering you again
- How's your jaw?
- l've been slapped around worse
Dwight, he was from a while back,
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours
And it was only cos l felt sorry for him
And it was only once
l've done some dumb things
Seeing as how
l'm one of those dumb things,
l can't give you
too hard a time about that, Shellie
But this guy, he's a menace
He might kill somebody if l don't stop him
l'll call you later
No, don't go
- Stop!
Damn it, Dwight
Damn it
You fool
You damned fool
Watch it, Jack
Cops
They're right on our ass
Not for long
Not where we're headed
Hey, baby. Hey, baby
Hop in, sugar
We'll get you there
Aw, sweetheart. l work the day shift
and it's been a long day
Besides, l don't do group jobs
Get in the car, baby
We'll just talk. lt'll be nice
l don't do talk jobs, either
Babydoll,
l've had me one hell of a bad day
l've been beat up every time l turn around
But the day l get turned down by a hooker
when l got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with..
well..
there's only so much a man can take
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo
The Amigo's a fag joint
Are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all?
That's far enough, Dwight
We've been on top of these peckerwoods
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them
Everything's under control
Enjoy the show
So, how's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?
Not right now, Gail
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?
That's your whole problem, Dwight
You worry too much
That, and your lousy taste in women
These days, anyway
Damn it, Gail
Not right now
Those clowns down the way -
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?
One of them thinks he is
He's outta control
l followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls
Us helpless little girls
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away..
..from seeing what Miho can do.
And she's been aching for some practice.
You're running out of alley, cowboy.
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.
You're a sassy little thing.
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.
They haven't killed anybody l know about
lt got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody
And they won't
OK, OK, OK. l sounded off
a little more than l should have
- l'm a little on edge
- Over the edge
lt's not a woman you need
lt's a good night's sleep
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack
You wanna see it?
You wanna see what l got?
l've seen all shapes, all sizes
You seen this one?
Get in the car
Aww Sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.
Oh, God, no
This is crazy
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all
Go ahead
Go ahead
Go ahead
- He's got the drop on her
- He's got squat
He's dead
He's just too damn dumb to know it
l got you right where l want you
This is a career-ending wound, whore
- And there's gonna be hell to pay
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy
Yeesh
This isn't funny
Don't anyone laugh
l got friends you can't imagine
Every one of you is gonna burn
Hang it up
She's just playing with you
- You're only making it worse
- You shut the hell up
Don't pull the trigger
She blocked the barrel, lt'll backfire
l told you to shut up
l can't see
What's happening?
l can't see
l can't hear anything
For God's sake, Miho, finish him
Yeah
Make it quick, will you?
That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out
Old Town will be left wide open
lt'll be war
The streets will run red with blood -
women's blood
The cops
The mob
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be
The hell they will
We got guns
We'll fight the cops and the mob
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us
- We'll go to war
- Don't be stupid, Gail
You wouldn't stand a chance
Get me a car
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine
l'll hide the bodies
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?
The cops know Rafferty came here
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer
They'll find him
and come gunning for us
l'll haul the bodies to the pits
The cops won't check the pits
Get that gun out of my face or l'll smack ya
Who do you think you are, giving orders?
- You got what you wanted out of us
- Shut up, Gail
You got what you wanted out of me
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us
Miho moves to my back
One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half
They'll be watching the roads
They'll catch you
lt'll be the bad old days all over again
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes
They won't be watching the roads. Not yet,
they won't. Get me a damn hardtop
lf l don't make it, you can have your war
Get that gun out of my face now
Bastard
l forgot how quick you are
My warrior woman
She almost yanks my head clean off,
shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts
An explosion that blasts away
the dull, grey years
between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine
A hardtop with a decent engine,
and make sure it's got a big trunk.
l'll always love you, baby
Always... and never
Where'd you find that heap?
Just look at that trunk
We'll never fit 'em all in
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,
you think maybe l could go home?
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe l'm gonna hurl
Sure, Becky, go home..
..but don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom
They'll never fit in that trunk
Not like this, they won't
Miho
Dry your hair as soon as you get home
You'll catch cold if you don't
Yeesh
Hey, Becky
Gail said no calls
l just want to hear my mom's voice
l won't tell her nothing
Please, don't say nothing to Gail
Hey, Mom?
Dizzy dames
What were they thinking, sticking me
with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?
We were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was,
we packed it so tight
There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,
out where anybody who cares to look
will see him
Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes
lt'll help
lt's got you smoking there, bud
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy
You're dead
l'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?
lt's got you hearing things
lt's got your nerves shot
lt's got you smoking
You know it's true
Nobody ever really quits
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down
- And your chips are down
- l'm fine. You shut the hell up
Will you look at that?
Those hookers let you down
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?
You sucker for the babes, you
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits
You shut the hell up
l'll make it
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie
Watch it
This is great
Just like being in a buddy movie
Shut up
Boy, you're screwed
lt's over
You're flushed
This time, l can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up
Sure, he's an asshole
Sure, he's dead
Sure, l'm just imagining that he's talking
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right
l don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop
Not in this heap
Pull over
The only question left
is whether l'm gonna kill him or not
Tough call
For all l know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids
My hand moves all on its own,
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer
- l don't know what to do
- You better stop. You're making him mad
Whatever you say
Your friend here..
party a little too hard tonight?
l'm the designated driver
You're driving with a busted tail light
l'll let you off with a warning
What next?
The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits
l shove the T-Bird the rest of the way
A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over
Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits,
l'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,
go home and call it a..
No more questions, Dallas
Do what l say
Clear the streets
We're in lockdown
We're not selling any tail in Old Town
Not tonight
Don't struggle
You'll only hurt yourself
Your cause is lost
We know everything
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered
There'll be arrests
There'll be deaths
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighbourhood
You will all be slaves
Nothing can stop this
But it is within your power
to save many lives
by facilitating the process of transition,
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town
Son of a bitch
l know you
l have suffered your kind before -
the dregs of Sin City
l serve a new master now,
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,
because, by now, he is surely dead
You don't know him
My man will find a way
He always finds a way
l can't fathom
these Americans always whining
and going on about how they got it so bad
This is a fine, grand country
Guiding light of the modern world, it is
Low taxes, land of opportunity
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?
Sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches
without shite to show for it
Yeesh
You find something, Murphy?
Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge
lt's all bent up
What's this stuck in it?
Bloody hell
lt's the bullet
You son of a bitch
Bastard
They weren't cops, these four
They were mercenaries
And if they were hired
by who l think they were,
the bad times haven't even started yet
And everything seemed
to be going so well
Remember, we don't have to
deliver every last inch of the man, Brian
You got a good point there, Ronnie
Lend me your knife
Should l take a nap
while l'm doing all this waiting?
l'm at the bone, all right?
There we go
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,
use your imagination, OK?
Silence, now
No air to breathe
Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils
Let it in
Let it fill your lungs
They were counting on you
and you blew it
Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist
Miho, you're an angel
You're a saint
You're Mother Teresa
You're Elvis
You're God
And if you'd shown up ten minutes
earlier, we'd still have Jackie Boy's head
Dwight, they got Gail
lt's a cinch
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail
But first, we gotta get
our hands on Jackie Boy's head
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this whole situation blows wide open
Miho, l hope to hell
you left one of 'em alive enough to talk
l let him know l'm not fooling around
We talk
Stay smart
Stay cool
lt's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn
Sometimes, that means dying
Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people
There they are
What do we do?
We stop 'em, Dallas
Jackie Boy's head is so close to me
l could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there
Get the head
Get the head
l got it
l got it
Suck on this, you stupid slag
l can't tell if Miho is alive or dead,
but l'm on my feet and every ounce of me
wants to get some killing done
You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it
Brave lad
l could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,
if l hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless
You got the drop on me, love
l'm as helpless as a baby
l got to come clean with you, sweetheart
lt was an outright lie l was giving ya
about me revolver being wet
You see, l'm not too fond of shootin'
lt's my preference to blow things up
Once you blast the roof off a pub
and seen all the parts flying off people,
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that
And here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote
But it's me knife l'll be doing you with
You killed me mates
Someone shoulda told ya - never give
an lrishman good cause for revenge
Deadly little Miho
You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to
She twists the blade
He feels it
l tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it
l grab poor Dallas's car phone and make
the most important call of my life
First, we gotta rescue Gail,
then comes the kill
The big, fat kill
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?
What, are you kidding me, man?
l could watch old Manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it
l mean, the man's an artist
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject
Your skin is perfect
Your nerves, responsive
Beautiful
Just give them what they want, Gail
- Becky?
- lt's over, Gail
There's no fighting them
Dwight's dead
They got what's left of that cop we killed
The mob's gonna turn it over to the police
chief, the cops are gonna mow us down
We gotta cut a deal
You little bitch
You sold us out
l didn't have no choice
They was gonna hurt my mom
You gotta cut a deal with these people
lt's selfish, you holding out like this
You're gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason
lt wasn't your mom
We could have protected her
and you know it
lt was the money, you stupid little bitch
Sure, there's money. Sure, you could've
moved my mom into Old Town
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me - a way out
l had to watch out for my own neck
Your neck
Your precious, scrawny, little neck
You're crazy. You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore
Schutz, fetch my blades
- Stuka, kill this one
- No, l was promised
Stupid little bitch
You deserve worse
l knew there was a reason
l got out of bed this morning
Nobody
l don't see nobody
Will you look at that?
lt's right through me. Guys, look
There's something wrapped around it
Some kind of note
Give it to me
lt's poked right through me
Guys, look
- lt's starting to really hurt
- Out back. Everyone
And bring the women
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?
McCarthy, you fool
Guys?
Dozens of them, armed to the teeth
l'm outnumbered, outgunned
But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow
They can't surround me
Sometimes, you can beat the odds
with the careful choice of where to fight
You can have Old Town, l don't care
Just give me the woman
Shut up
Dwight, don't do this
- Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right
- Shut up, or l'll plug you
Of course, Mr McCarthy
A fair trade
She's all yours
Now, if you'll explain to me why
we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces..
Dwight, what have you done?
Exactly what l had to
Every step of the way
No. lt isn't right
There wasn't no tape over his mouth
How come there's tape over his mouth?
Where to fight counts for a lot
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you do good
But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns
No
McCarthy, you shit
The girls all know the score
No escape, no surrender, no mercy
We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of 'em
Every last one
Not for revenge,
not because they deserve it,
not because it'll make
the world a better place
We need a heap of bloody bodies
so when mob boss Wallenquist
looks over his charts of profits and losses,
he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town
The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing
with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,
and so am l
The fire, baby
lt'll burn us both
There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire,
my warrior woman, my Valkyrie
You'll always be mine
Always..
and never
Evenin', officer
l don't have to introduce myself, do l?
You read the papers
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture
You know who l am and what l can do
And l'm doin' you, Hartigan
Cold and hard, l'm doing you
You blew my son's ear off
You blew his arm off
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off
He's in a coma right now
They say he may never come out of it
My boy
He could've been the first Roark to become
the President of the United States,
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful?
Power don't come from a badge or a gun
Power comes from lying
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you
Once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts ain't true,
you've got 'em by the balls
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?
l could pump you full of bullets right now,
and l wouldn't even be arrested
Everyone would lie for me -
everyone who counts
Otherwise, all their own lies -
everything that runs Sin City -
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards
But l want you firm and fit and healthy
l'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery
Fix that heart condition of yours
You're gonna keep on living a long time
l'm gonna make sure of that
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,
disgraced, destroyed..
alone
Your wife?
You tell her the truth and she's dead
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead
They won't let me testify
l told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like l was crazy
They talked my parents
into keeping me away
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do
l told them that you saved me
from that Roark creep,
but they won't even check me out
to see that l'm still a virgin
l'm still a virgin, still alive -
thanks to you
They got it all backwards
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought
But you'll always remember things right
That's gonna mean a lot to me
But stay away, Nancy
They'll kill you if you don't stay away
Don't visit me
Don't write me
Don't even say my name
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but l'll still write to you, Hartigan
l'll sign my letters ''Cordelia''
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books l read
l'll write you every week, for forever
Sure, kid
Now, run on home
lt's not safe for you here
Bye, Nancy
l love you
John Hartigan
Mr. Law and Order
Mr. By the Book
Mr. High and Mighty
l gotta give you credit, being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years
without it catching up with you
lt's catching up with you now,
friend of mine
lt's catching up with you but good
Maybe l oughta look at him
He doesn't look too good
He's hale and hearty, Tammy. See?
He's the picture of health
That Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?
l rented her out of Old Town
l wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison
You hear me, Hartigan?
lf you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,
you might just get some of Tammy
You see that?
She flinched
You make her sick
She heard about you and that little girl
This is nothing but a price l promised
myself l'd pay, and l'm paying it
You don't save a little girl's life, then
turn around and throw her to the dogs
Not in my book, you don't
They want a confession
They won't get it
There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary
She calls herself ''Cordelia'',
just like she promised
She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away
At first, l figure
she'll send another note or two
before her young mind
moves on to better things
But every Thursday, another one arrives
What a sweet kid
l do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when l reach for it
She's the only friend l've got -
the daughter l never had
My sweet Cordelia
Skinny little Nancy Callahan
Eight years pass
Then comes a Thursday
when l bound from my cot,
excited as a kid at Christmas,
only to find myself
staring at the damn floor of my damn cell,
looking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there
Then another Thursday with no letter
ls she all right?
Did something happen to her?
Nothing
Two months now -
not a word from Nancy
Did they find her?
Did they get to her?
Of course
Stupid old man
Do your maths
Nancy's 19 years old
How long did you expect her
to keep writing?
She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did
She's forgotten you, old man
You're alone
You're all alone
This guy smells awful -
like bad food
Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer
He stinks so bad, l want to throw up
Practically knocked my head off,
the bastard
When l come to, l see it
The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses,
but there's no letter inside of it
There's something soft,
something that ought to be alive -
a hunk of meat and bone
that ought to be the index finger
of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl
How the hell did they find her?
She was so careful
She never gave away
where she lives or where she works
l've got to get out
l've got to help her
Nothing else matters -
not my life and not my pride, either
lt's only one final surrender they want
You got me, Roark
You beat me
l say everything they want to hear,
just the way they want to hear it
l tell them l'm a twisted,
wretched child molester
l agree to everything they want from me
l love you, Nancy
lt's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me
Prison's made you paranoid
Talk about water under the bridge
Christ
Eight years
Yeah
Eight years
Well, if it's any consolation to you..
you made me hate myself
- Any word from Eileen?
- Yeah
She got remarried four years ago
She had two kids
l'm sorry, John
Don't be
l'm glad
Eileen always wanted kids
She'll make a good mother
Like you said, Bob -
water under the bridge
Bob and l get on
with our fond farewells to each other,
then l go looking for the only human being
on the planet who means a damn to me -
Nancy
How could they have found out it was you
writing all those letters to me?
How did they find out who you are?
And what have they done to you, baby?
Not a sound
No sign of life
Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man,
like a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?
What has he done to Nancy?
lt's like all she ever does
is read and study and write
No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere
Closest thing to a clue
is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon
lt's a long shot,
but maybe she's got some friends there
A dead end
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do
with a pack of drunks and losers like this
But if there's anything to be found here,
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is
or whoever kidnapped her
and mutilated her, this is the place
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. l'm looking for somebody
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger
lt's not like that
Her name is Nancy
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim
She's just warming up
Skinny little Nancy Callahan
She grew up
She filled out
Nancy Callahan, 19 years old
And here l was,
expecting a skinny little bookworm,
maybe a bit too shy for her own good
How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years
How the hell did they find her?
Then it hits me
They were bluffing
l've led them straight to her
She hasn't spotted you yet
Turn around and walk out the door
Lead the creep outside
Get that Beretta away from him somehow,
and kill him
l'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer
Just a few seconds and she'll be safe
No, Nancy
Don't notice me
Don't recognise me
There's no time to explain
l've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger
We need to get out of here
right this second
Whatever you say, Hartigan
Let me throw some clothes on
And here l'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters
Kept me going
Kept me from killing myself
Hurry up, will you?
- Maybe l should drive
- Not a chance
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody
- l don't have a gun
- Under the seat
lt's loaded and it works
Yeah, this'll do
Taken it to the range a couple of times
Kicks like a mule
Hartigan, there's so much
l've wanted to say to you
You've never been far from my thoughts
l've lain awake nights, thinking of you
What are you talking about?
Keep driving, Nancy
Keep driving and keep the car on the road
She's counting on you, old man
What are you doing?
Prove you're still worth a damn
Try and keep it on the road, Nancy
He's a decent shot
He's got skill,
but he's in too much of a hurry
Throwing away bullets
like they were candy
He doesn't know how to take his time
Aim careful and look the devil in the eye
Stop the car, Nancy
Gotta confirm the kill
- What?
- Stop the car, now
Right
Stop the car, confirm the kill
Sorry. l got a little rattled
lt's OK. You did great
Sit tight. l'll be right back
No. Let me stay close
Nothing can happen to me
when l'm with you
Please?
Let me stay close
The stink - l almost gag
His blood smells
even worse than he does
- Jesus
- And it's all over the place
But the creep himself, he's gone
We're out of time
The sirens - l used to welcome the sound
There's nothing to do now
but find a place to hole up for the night,
get Nancy calmed down, and figure out
what on Earth l'm going to do next
The stink - somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel
Nancy, l went to your apartment
Your window was thrown wide open
The rooms looked almost empty
That's why l was sure
you'd been kidnapped
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year
l swore if l ever saw you again,
l'd show you l grew up strong
But there l was, just like before,
scared and helpless
- l'm such an asshole
- You should sit down
You'll feel a little bit better if you sit down
l've never been all that good with people
When it comes to reassuring
a traumatised 19-year-old,
l'm as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench
lt's always been you, Hartigan
All these years
lt's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy
You're just exhausted
You need to sleep
- Sleep with me
- Stop it, Nancy
Eight years
Why do you think
l kept writing you those letters?
lt wasn't just gratitude
l tried to fall in love with boys
Even thought l did once or twice
But l was already in love with you
That's enough
Jesus Christ
l'm old enough to be your grandfather
- You're just scared
- l'm not scared
No
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this
For God's sakes, you're just a kid
l love you
l love you, too
With all my heart
Cold shower - it helps
No, Nancy
Recognise my voice, Hartigan?
Recognise my voice,
you piece of shit cop?
l look different,
but l bet you can recognise my voice
Sure
l recognise your voice, Junior
Everything's gone straight to hell
l've been suckered
into betraying the only friend l've got,
and put her in the hands of a murdering
rapist l thought l'd put down for good
Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator
lt's all gone to hell
Klump, it's me
l got a dead man needs to be fetched
l want you to set me up for a party
l've already got the girl, you dumb shit
Hey, it better be perfect
or l'm calling my dad
My tools better be clean and sharp
lt better be ready
lt better be perfect
l get to do whatever l want,
however l want, whenever l want it
My dad - l'd love him if l didn't hate him
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs,
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects
l'm not complaining, though
Since you've been gone,
l've been having the time of my life
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia
We all wondered
who wrote all those letters
She left not a clue
Clever girl
And so pretty, so pretty
A little old for my taste,
but l can forgive that just this once
Nancy, don't scream
Whatever he does to you, don't scream
She'll scream. l'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault
They've all screamed, Hartigan
Dozens of them - maybe a hundred
Eight years' worth
Every one of them has screamed
And if there weren't
so many people hereabout,
l would show you how
l'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream
lt's gonna be one hell of a show
This is it
No way to fight it now
No hope left
No chance
This is it
This is the end
No
Give it a shot, old man
Keep your neck tight. Move
The window - maybe there's an alarm
The window
Keep your neck tight, goddamn it
Stay conscious
Stay conscious
No alarm
The glass. Cut the rope
You can do it
You can do it
lt is inclement upon me
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car to heist, Mr Shlubb
lrrelevant to said mission is the following
query, which l now put forth to you
Wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports -
boner-inspiring though it may be -
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?
l can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or l'll cut your damn head off
ln plain English, creep
The answer you seek is rural,
even agrarian
The farm
That's all l need to hear
Every cop on the force
knows about the Roark family's farm
and to stay away from it
Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal
Once things get loud,
l'll probably have use for the cannons
But at first, l'll have to play it quiet
Quiet and nasty
Nancy's car - six miles from the farm
''Nobody but me can keep
this heap running'', she told me
Good girl
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard
and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again
You kept your mouth shut
l'll bet Junior was furious
l'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce
But you stayed strong
You bought a few extra minutes
There's still a chance, Nancy
Don't scream
l ditch the car a mile or so from the farm
and make my way through the woods
l'm not halfway there when it hits
My heart
Can't be my heart
l was cured
Bad cough - blood in it
Doesn't matter now
l don't have to stay alive
that much longer, anyway
Rotten way to kill a man, but it's quiet
Hate yourself later
You're only making this worse for yourself,
you stupid cow
Do you think l'm tired?
ls that it?
Do you think l'm getting tired?
You're the one who's gonna crack
You'll crack
You'll cry and beg
You'll scream
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow
You'll scream
You're thinking the whip
was the worst l could do?
That was foreplay
Hartigan was right about you
You can't get it up unless l scream
You're pathetic
You're pathetic
lt's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that
lt brings out the worst in me
Stupid old man
ln too much of a hurry
Damn
lt can't be
Charging in like Galahad,
just like l told myself l wouldn't!
Stupid old man
- You tagged him good
- Don't take no chances. Perforate the fool
Good advice
Give it up, Junior
lt's over
Let her go
You're dreaming, Hartigan
l get to see your eyes while l fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you
Look at you
You're about to keel over
You can't even lift that cannon
Sure, l can
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man
Nancy, l'm sorry
l'm taking no chances with you
First l soften you up,
and then it's showtime
Here it comes
lt's gonna hurt
You're right about that
Sucker
l take away his weapon
Both of them
Eight long years, son of a bitch
After a while, all l'm doing is pounding
wet chunks of bone into the floorboards,
so l stop
So long, Junior
Been a pleasure
l didn't scream, Hartigan, not once
l didn't scream
l know it, baby
You grew up strong
By the time l get her to the car,
Nancy stops shaking
Her skin is warm again
She's herself again
Thanks for remembering my coat
And for all the little things
Like saving my life, twice
- You better get rolling
- You're not coming along?
No. l have friends on their way,
to collect evidence
l'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open
l'm gonna clear my name
l'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs
l can't lose you, not again
You'll never lose me, Nancy
Nancy Callahan, the love of my life
Shame to lie to her
l hope she forgives me for it
Get Senator Roark behind bars?
Sure
And maybe after l've pulled off
that miracle, l'll go and punch out God
There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark
l killed his only son
The bloodline is cut
Roark's lost his goddamn legacy
He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me
He'll go after me through Nancy
He'll find her again
There'll be no end to it
She'll never be safe
Not as long as l'm alive
There's only one way to beat him
An old man dies,
a young woman lives
Fair trade
l love you, Nancy
Yes
Mom, don't go on like that
lt's not the city. l could've gotten
