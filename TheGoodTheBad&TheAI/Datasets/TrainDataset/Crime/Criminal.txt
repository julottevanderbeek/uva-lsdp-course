Alright, honey, I love you.
That's mine.

earlier. Send a cleaning team now.
We go to a cement factory in Horn Link Way.
Deptford Docks.
Put it in your GPS, you can follow that.
Alright.
The route to the destination
has been calculated.
The Docks Deptford.
Very romantic.
Move.
This is not the cement Factory.
What?
This is not the cement Factory.
HornlinkWay, it is. The GPS does not lie.
Turn around.
Fuck!
Do we have him?
Nobody here.
Look GPS and firm number.
Find him now.
If you have never been to a
slaughterhouse, you have to go.
To see what we do
to those poor animals.
We use this to be canon.
A nasty way to
push them towards their doom.
Now, where is our friend?
Billy! I respect your silence.
I really do.
The problem is...
I need that Dutchman.
- Last chance.
- Fuck you, psycho!
Let us go, go, go...
Shove!
What is established?
Check right. Check right.
Docks Deptford clear.
Coming.
Go, go, go ..
No. Activation required.
We need a doctor.
Confirmed, it's Agent Pope.
Perimeter secured.
Agent not responding.
Repeat, agent not responding.
Ready to defibrillate.
Loading panel.
Fuck!
Doctor, I'm so sorry, but this man
says he is from the government.
Dr. Franks, I have only
one job at the moment...
Which is to get you on an A400 Airbus
sitting on ..back in Dover in ACB.
Your Memory program is gone...
We have an officer down and we need...
What only he knew.
You will retrieve it for us.
Is there any brain activity?
That was taken a few hours ago.
I find five years away from human trial...
You have 48 hours to make ithis work.
National Security is around,
at the highest level.
Can you? Can you attach the
memories of a dead mammal to a live one?
- Yah.
- We need.
I need my equipment, my staff and
an appropriate receipients.
Any candidates?
Hum! I have got no idea.
USA PRISON HAZELTON,
WEST VIRGINIA.
I just hope, where are you taking him out?
Jericho Stuart. He is a malefice
more than half his life.
He has no impulse control.
No sense of proportion.
He is unable to calculate the potential
negative consequences of his actions.
It has a total lack of empathy
for anyone or anything.
Two.
He feels nothing. No hatred, No love.
It gets worse.
This is what appears to be like a gangman.
Tried to recruit him.
Who is this?
I have no idea about this man.
You can't punish someone if he does
not know that he was doing anything wrong.
He does not understand the society or
how he supposed to behave.
Come on.
Hi! Jericho. Come on.
These men are here to see you.
They take you out.
I haven't have my lunch.
That's right.
Bring Jericho's lunch.
Yah! Send him one.. Thats right.
Alright enough of this.
Lunch is over.
You come with us now. Stop.
I can't.
I have a chain around my neck.
I Know, you have to use more than that.
Yeh!...
You.. Fuckers!
Are you fuckers?
Wait!
- May we open the cell?
- Yes.
Gentlemen, Helicopter G-EMHE, special
you were cleared for runway 22L.
Give this to the doctor.
Do you have allergies, Jericho?
- What?
- Are you allergic ...?
Yah! Lock.
Good kind or bad kind?
You tell me.
We're all set, doctor.
Any previous surgeries? Earlier?
I do not need surgery to...
Okay, give him 150mg...
What are you doing to me?
You had an injury over here.
You've hurt, alright, when you were young?
Do you remember what happened?
Yah! My mother.
I told my daddy that he wasn't my daddy.
So, he called her a whore and threw
me out the car window.
We will take care of you, Jericho.
My next guest is Xavier Heimdhal,
best known as the founder...
of Stone Harp Industries, making firms
Computer and Communication systems.
But recently he was charged of
treason by the Spanish Government.
Mr. Heimdahl, how do you respond
to these serious allegations?
Well! If these treasons to call out massive
corruption at the highest levels...
And to disclose political murders...
Yes, then I'm guilty.
But your allegations have
never been proven in court of Law.
Of course not. How could they be?
The police, the judges and the courts...
are all part of the world's
most powerful criminal enterprise.
Sir, to clarify, you are calling to
overthrow the Spanish government?
No, I called for overthrow of all governments.
Politicians, religious fanatics...
Brainwashing by corporations, the corruption
of the banking system, gone... gone.
Washington, Berlin
will be great cemeteries.
And only then will people understand that
there is a better way to run this world.
Thats what you really want.
A worldwide revolution.
Governments must fall.
I have one.
Elsa Miller, former German Special Forces.
One of the Heimdahl, Staff, you have to go.
Jericho Stuart is now landing.
AIR BASE RAF Lakenheath
SUFFOLK, ENGLAND
Billy still breathing?
Artificially breathing. The machine is
keeping his body alive. He has gone.
Do you See those diodes? They give
a micro charge their frontal lobes.
Although the brain is clinically dead,
charging active neurons one last time
and allows us to see
a map of your neural pattern.
What then transferred
to the other's head?
No... its not... not a transfer.
Jericho was chosen
because Stuart has syndrome frontal lobe.
A trauma to his brains as a child,
is incredibly rare. One in 10 millions.
His frontal lobe remains in an undeveloped
state. A hotbed of neural stem cells.
We stimulatee them with theta
waves duplicating the pattern.
You might have done this work?
The subjects rats walked staight through
mazes. Thats what they had never seen before.
Rats?
What about human trials?
You are looking at it.
What happened to that other guy?
Test Theta.
Oh! The temperature is hiking.
Before bleeding, it's in 102. 104.
Calls back... stroke 104 sir.
What is going on?
We're losing him.
We have to stop bleeding or he will die.
Alright, we remove the robotic injector...
Hey! You pull that thing.
You, carry on.
You think... still we can't.
Carry on.
It is stabilizing.
What we tell his wife?
Nothing.
As far as she knows,
Billy died ten days ago.
That is not right.
Now if he comes from nothing like Billy.
Like Billy.
Jericho?
Jericho?
Jericho.
Jericho.
Jericho take it easy.
Everything is fine.
My head...
I've just gave you an injection.
It will take effect in a minute.
You will feel better.
You swear God?
I swear. You trust me.
Ok. Everybody out.
No no no .. there is a protocol ..
No, No, you stay.
Everybody else, come on!
Hey, Hey, Look at me, Look at me.
Do you know who I am?
My .. My head is bad,
I need some kind of pill.
Yes, no, I love in getting thing.
But first I need you to remember.

Why, you messing with me boss?
I'm sick, doc.
I need some kind of shock..
I need something.

Your name is Bill Pope.
Even you may tell your office is in CIA.
Intelligence?
Hum.. Fuck ...What the fuck?
- Pay attention.
- What did you do to me?
- Pay... What did you do to me?
- Pay attention!
Right, Jan Strook
Dutch programmer, a genius.
He sold trapdoors to Heimdahl.
I need water.
That's better.
Now, a few days ago...
The Dutchman dug a
wormhole in the deep web.
You can stop there and give me
a moment with him to hear me.
For me this is the theta major
brain surgery...
he is not able to tell you anything...
Oh!
Suddenly the Dutchman
has got command under his control.
He can fire missiles at anytime, anywhere.
If... over his head,
So the Dutchman calls you, Bill Pope.
He needed protection
Offered to make a deal...
With you, Bill Pope.
I need something, please.
An aspirin. I beg...
Give him an aspirin.
Aspirin is not good for you.
But this will help.
Billy, we had orders to put it
in the Dutchman's head.
But you forced the game off,
because you thought
you could trust him by paying him on.
Remember?
Billy!... With, we did it your way.
You brought him to such a safe house.
Remember? Anything? Billy!
Where is he? Where the Dutchman right now?
That's all we need to know.
You went back to him.
You had picked up the money.
You without action went
back to close the deal.
Remember? Remember?
I remember nothing, Fucker.
Me confused with somebody else.
Try family.
Your daughter's name? Come on.
Remembers it. What is her name?
Emma. Your wife Jilly? Jill?
Come on. Shit. You remember.
Something. Anything.
We have nothing.
The science behind it is good.
Shit, Fuck it Science.
How long have you worked on this?
We want a refund.
Pack up these trials. Yes, sir.
Guys, we're back to square one.
We start from the beginning.

For asylum, a permanent passport, guaranteed

Turn it off. Let us think about this...
Heimdahl have safe house here.
The luggage stores is here. So somewhere
between those two points, the Dutchman is.
But where?
Hotel, hostel? The homeless shelters

You're not listening to me.

It's not about the money,
but my freedom.
I will demonstrate my control over
Vigilant Shield today at 6 PM.
Understood.
We'll wait for deadline.
Let's see what the Dutch can do.
Jilian called the police.
They have a description
of the intruder.
It looks like Jericho, she
told he knew personal details.
PIN number, security code.
You're kidding me.
I talked to him.
He recognized my voice and knew my name.
That's fucked up.
The lab report just came back.
They confirmed that three passengers.
The two were officers in the vehicle.
But the third passenger in
the car was not Jericho.
Then I have to find him.
Here we go - You
change trash for cash.
Come on. I'm hungry.
Hello, I want this and vanilla...
Hello, Francoise.

Fourth floor! Fourth floor!
Sorry.
This is not right. Where's the bag Billy?
Where's the bag?
God!
Guys, someone logged in as Billy.
Some must be Jericho.
- Lock it.
- No... leave him.
- I want to see what he is searching for?
- I can not get into the account..
What is the access point?
Terminal one in Public Librariy..
- It is this. This one.
- Okay.
It looks like he accessed our
telephone tracking software.
Dr. Franks.
Hello - it is Quaker.
Jericho is on his way...
We have your location, do not hang up.
Do you understand me?
- Do not hang up.
- I understand.
What's up, doc?
I need more of these pills.
Without those pills Bill Pope
makes my head broken inside.
You remember? I remeber. My fuck ..
Breaks my skull in two...
My head bursts apart
just like yours...
Unless you find out how you can
help me. Yes. Yes. Ofcourse.
Where to? Do not say
I do not hear anything.
Pharmacy, near the down road.
Good.
Let us go.
Hello, Dr. Franks.
Hey! Hey! Just hurry up, yes.
That was mean, I'm sorry.
Do you hear that? I'm sorry. As Billy
talking not me Yah! He fucked up my name.
Billy Pope's personality is
affecting your behavior.
And a damn know about Billy, I know
nothing about that. All I know is that...
I'm living this. I can do stuff.
It was you, Alright!
Do not want to put stuff in
my head, I try to...
You have skills.
That's right, I do math now.
I talk languages, I know what
I want and I do what I want.
Everything is different. I am grand new.
Memories are chronological?
I do not know.
They are triggered by things...
I say, I smell.
I use sometimes things just emerge.
I just need one of those pills.
All I need is...
All I need is one pill.
Jericho! You recognize Billy's responses?
What about places, touch, smell?
What about emotions?
Yah! I met his wife and child.
- And?
- And...
There was something.
What do you mean something?
People always told me I
did not feel anything... this and that.
I don't know.. talking family still.
I can not... I can not do this.
Shove.
What about now?
Now you messed me up.
For making you better.
These are called emotions.
Whatever they are, they are not useful to
me - You do not mean much without them.
Thanks for the pills, Doc.
I need some tests from you
before the process begins to fade..
Disappear?
How much time do I have?
Maybe I can make it longer.
Then I'd better go right now.
I have things to do.
Make money to find. Money?
Yes, a big bag full money.
- What will you do with money, when you find it?
I don't know.
Buy .. Buy a house you know!
A TV. One vacation like other people, right!
- Of course.
Take what you owe.
- On the house, sir.
- Cheers.
Who says now Cheers?
Ruiza, you still have 20 pounds
for Arsenal.
I think it's fair if you pay me, right!
That's enough.
You remember everything, right?
Where is the Dutchman?
I do not know.
But I know how I have a single break.
I do not know what you guys do, but
have stop beating him.
Especially in the head.
Yah! I get the point.
But he is coming along.
So who am I to do now?
Is it Bill Pope?
No, it's Jericho, influenced
by Billy's memories...
- Skills, routines.
- Routines?
Yah! Routines.
If routines. Basically what we do in life
I is reduced to subconscious routines.
It is these things that make the
leap of Bill Pope to Jericho.
He makes it with money.
A bag which is driving him.
Offer that money.
And he will give you everything you want.
Take him to the last
place you had to Dutch.
Trigger memories of Billy
Pope and follow the trail.
A source from the Lubyanka
Square just gave it to us.
The Dutchman wants to make
a deal with the Russians.
He is going to give
proof today at 6 PM.
Did you hear that? We're fucked.
Becaused, you wanted a psychopath finish
that instead of a hero from SEAL things.
The ransom money... in the bag.
You take us to the
Dutchman and it is yours.
Do we have a deal?
Do we have a deal?
That! That!
Yah! The beach.
That too. I want to go there.
Okay! Okay! You... you can go to the beach.
Now, We have a deal?
Yah!
- Don't shoot.
- Don't shoot..
Stop! Down.
Only you can put out as spy.
The Dutchman, where is he?
And the money is yours.
- Wher is money?
- Corner.
I will get there.
And the picture.
Which way, Jericho?
- Right.
- Right.
Sir, the facial recognition
system just detect a red alert.
Pull over. Stop.
Put the convicted waiting and send it home.
That's it!
The Dutch has been right
in the city airport MI5...
We have to go.
Hey, hey! My money.
Hey, what about my money?
Elsa, he is yours now.
I need him alive.
I'm afraid it's not your man.
- I'm wounded.
- Give me the gun.
Don't kill.
Sir! A team of drivers
searching Jericho's body.
What a fucked mess.
The Russians can not be
allowed to make the buy.
Check their embassy. Anything in,
anything out will be filtered, clear!
Yes Sir!
Heimdahl bastard that of
our aims from the start.
I want new pass
codes, new firewalls...
Switch to military channels, understand?
Yes, Sir.
.
Today, Cannon
Bridge, were fired.
Several people were
seriously injured.
The authorities still searching for
bodies fell into the River Thames.
I'm sorry that I lost it.
- Maybe if I...
- If, if, if... if.
If you had kept closer to the Dutchman,
may be now we already had the wormhole.
I must say I'm not that
happy at the moment, Elsa.
- Do you want me to leave?
- No.
I apologize.
Good.
We need to find Jericho.
Mommy, can I watch TV?
Sure, sweetie.
What are you doing in my basement?
What is all this?
That belongs to Emma.
Did you work with Billy?
I do not think...
Someone like him ever worked
with someone like me..
They stuck Billy in my head.
I have a scar, you see?
All stuff he knew, all stuff he could do
I have mixed up inside me.
That's impossible.
The first car you too have bought...
Used Rover. Smelled like fish and
chips. The clutch marred the first week...
Of course I did not have
the $ 100 to fix it.
I told you, they put his brain in me.
Thats enough.
Mom, where are you? I'm hungry.
Just a second, baby.
Sunday night.
Chicken and waffles.
You doing the chicken, the waffles.
I know she likes the syrup
in the bottom only.
I see pieces that pop up suddenly...
At different places.
I see things.
Do not ask me how they did it, but...
- They did.
- Why?
Aah!
They're looking details of a place where
your husband hid a guy before he was killed.
Now, ..you to take care of.
I'll finish here.
I'll finish here and go away.
Leave me alone.
Billy could never hurt
you, so can I?
Armed missile to port, sir.
That's not possible.
Guidance systems are to go.
Tracking system to go.
Turn them off.
I can not, we are blocked sir.
Missile fired. I repeat, missile fired.
Send self-destruct code
before it reaches its target.
Alpha 30, Echo 40, Bravo Hotel.
Negative..., not responding.
It's good! It destroyed! It's good!
Jesus Christ.
We do not fired that missile, sir.
Did you know I lost my daddy?
Yah!
He gave me Ellie, for my birthday.
If we do not dig deeper,
its trunk sticking out.
Do deeper.
Are you hurt?
Stop.
Emma, come here please!
No mommy, we bury Ellie.
Come here.
He said he was a friend of daddy.
Go away, please.
Can you stay for dinner? He is nice.
Emma, go inside.
I make waffles and then I go.
Come and play.
- What?
- Come play.
- I do not know.
- I'll teach you.
I do not know if this is a good idea.
Fine. Come on.
Come on.
Just put your hands well.
Put your hand there and touch.
And then you do...
That's okay.
That's good and again.
Emma, it's late.
It's time to go to bed.
Yes, Mommy. Good night, Jericho.
Good night, Mommy.
Good night, honey.
Who are you?
I don't know.
Most of my life a number.
My brains do not always work well.
I have not always done well.
Having your husband
in my head made me...
It made me feel things.
Knowing things.
Right, wrong.
I guess it does not matter.
The doctor says it will disappears soon.
Can you tell me what Billy felt?
Can you?
That's too much!
There was something funny
that Billy used to do.
That was our signal that he loved me.
I...
I know... I Know.
I know with that what is supposed
to be in the night...
But I never... Our wedding day.
Do you remember?
Yes.
The beach.
The first time you gave to Emma.
I was so happy.
Yah!... I... I have...
I... I feel it... I feel it.
He loves you.
So much.
Where will you go now?
I don't know. Where...
Where ...he takes me.
Then stay here.
You can stay on the couch.
It would not be the first
time on that couch.
Our Top Story: A mysterious missile was
launched off the coast of Portugal.
The question is where did
the missile come from.
Good morning. I brought you some fresh coffee.
- Thanks.
Do not worry about it.
It's okay.
Where the missile came from. We do
not know who will be held responsible.
You work at the university. There is a cage
in the library. A bookcase with a key.
Yes, there are rare books...
Billy and I used to go there sometimes..
Why? Does this have something to do with...
Yes... Yes.
Jilly. I need a car.
And the key to the book.
Oh! Sure..
We'll have Jill money, lots of money.
I wish I could keep him.
Emma, come upstairs, please.
I am coming.
Come, You must take a shower.
Have you done down the door?
Yes.
Where is Jericho?
You're the guy, who killed me.
Good memory.
Yah!
If you hurt me, I'll do worse.
I respect your belief.
And you do well..
On there.
Sir, I have something.
Akhmadov, Russian FSB operative.
What makes arriving in a
fishing boat in Dagana?
It seems that is not stupid enough
to try it alone from the embassy.
They are bringing a team to grab
and pick up the Dutchman!
Put me in the air, now!
Stay in 1-11. They're
heading right toward us.
We follow the Russians.
They will lead us to the Dutchman.
I do not particularly like children.
They never meet expectations.
Jericho.
Jericho! Help us, please.
Boarding.
No!... Please!
Stop! .. No more violence
No more violence. Get him.
Take me to the Dutchman.
He's in there.
Let me see thermal images.
The Russian team was in the other truck.
We follow them, navigate.
All units, we are in a covert persecution
Do not approach. Understood.
There, at the university.
Do not approach until we see the Dutchman.
All units, they are not approachable.
Let's go!
Team Snipers, what is your position?
Sniper team on move.
Sir, we have Heimdahl and Jericho.
Follow me. Follow me.
All units, come.
Disable the Russian team.
We need Jericho alive.
Your wife and child just died.
Put this thing on the ground.
Your man is not there. They do not have.
What do you mean?
I just said they dion't have it.
I just told you. He's up there. Alright.
They do not have...
I'll go. Go to the airfield.
You need to get out of here.
Get to Dutch. I'll see you there.
CHEMISTRY LAB
