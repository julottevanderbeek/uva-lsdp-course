Oh bloody useless.
Just give me that
I suppose we should cover her
Yes
Let's call an ambulance
Right
So?
They're not a hurry I
told they she was dead
- No eggs this morning?
- I forgot to buy eggs
Get off
Quick
You didn't see anything?
Wait
OK
- What do the police think?
- The sergeant doesn't know
It was not a murder, there
are no marks on the body
You had a good look then
You can't keep your eyes off
women even when she's dead
I think she fell on water
So how do you explain
she was half naked?
May be she was drunk
May be she wander
on boats or something
May be she was pregnant
Right
Don't worry, it's
just the drink
What do you think, Joe?
- About what?
- The dead
I think she went to
the bridge fully dressed
To breath the warm night air
Then she took off her jacket
and put it on the ground
And then she
unbuttoned her blouse
And then she lifted
up her brassieres
And dropped it down on
top of other clothes
An she undone button of her skirt,
and it slipped down over her hips.
Then she undone her stockings
And hold them up so they blew in the breeze
before she let them flew off into the night
And she shivered
She wondered if she
really wanted to do it
She answered this question by
kicking her clothes into the river
And horridly now she take off
her garter and her knickers
And there she be,
standing in a petticoat
Thinking over what
brought her to this
And the with
particle below her
She dropped into
the river like a rose
And float there for a moment
And begone
What kind of
women would do that?
Just an ordinary woman
You are going to sit
there all day drinking tea?
Hi
Sign here and don't dirt it
You are the one
who found the girl?
Right
There are evil
men in this town
- How come you get so little water?
- Shut your mouth
Come on, Jim. This way
There's a good pub in Leers.
We should go there
for a game of darts
Right
Joe challange me to
a game of darts.
- You play darts?
- Sometimes
Just to pass the time
You don't find anything more
interesting to spend the time?
I can tell one or two thing
but not in front of a kid
Don't you laugh to yourself
- What is so funny?
- Eat your potato.
All of it
- Don't kick me, mom
- Stop yelling
You finished, Joe?
May be they'll say something in the
evening newspapers about that body
Do you think they'll
write about us?
No
Myself and Joe picked up a
body from the river this morning
- Naked
- Murder
Possible. She
had no clothes on
- Was she cut?
- Not a mark on her
Here we are
A body of a dead woman was found
in the River Clay this morning
The woman was wearing
only a thin petticoat
So far she was unidentified
- Police...
- You said she was naked
The same thing,
it was transparent
Les, I've got a headache,
I'm going back to the barge
- Another game of darts?
- Another time
I'll give you a game
Where's Les?
He's found someone
to play darts with
He'll be here at least an hour
We'll wake the boy
Why don't we go up on deck?
I'm not going any further
Police are
investigating that woman
There's a bit in the
newspaper about its
What makes you think of that?
Something to say
You have done enough
talking for one night
Are you sorry?
That's not good, do we?
It's pity if he's coming back
What?
It's pity if he's coming back
The bunk there
You're nice, Joe
You hungry? I'll
fry you an egg
No, not now
I'll take a cup of tea though
- You two are bloody quiet
- Same as you, no?
- What's up Les?
- I know fine well what's up
He's lost money at darts again. And he
came back here to try to take out at me
- Listen woman...
- You shut your damned mouth, Leslie Gold!
You have no rights
to yell at me
I have never lost
money at darts
You are a liar!
- Tea is ready?
- You in a hurry?
The tea is ready
when it's ready
You read that they
wrote in the papers
They didn't mention about us
I am not really
interested in any of that
- Have you been swimming?
- I don't swim
How about you?
I don't have a
swimming costume
You are here on holiday?
It's free day today
What's your name?
Cathie
Would you like to go with
me for a walk, Cathie?
Where to?
Over there
Tim's over board!
The boy is
overboard, Ella. Help
- You alright?
- Right
Thank you.
Thanks, Joe
- Look at that
- A funfair. Can we go there?
You can ask your mom
Ella. Look at that
May be we go there with Tim?
- I've my work to do. You take him
- I'll stay aboard if you want to go
I have no time. You go
Come along, Joe?
Stretch for your legs
Yes, all right
Here we are
Watch me
- Yes, yes, that one!
- Got it
You see, I always win
How do you like it, son?
- And that's it
- You are touching the line, sorry
- Excuse me, I was not touching the line
- You touched the line
What are you doing here?
- I'm working here now
- Right, right, Bob. This is Joe Huggy.
He works with us
couple of months
- Nice to meet you, Joe.
- Me too
Me and Les, we used to
work on the same boat
- Never the same shipyard
- No
- That was good time?
- Yes
Bob, here is my son, Jim.
- Jim, this is Bob.
- We close the game
I don't want to go
back to the barge
Do you want to go to the picture?
There are two of them in town
- Do you want to go to the picture?
- Yae
Joe, do you want to
go to the picture?
No, no. I'll walk into town
then go back to the barge
Let make it quick
Go, Joe. I don't
want to see you
Go
Look what you've done
Give it to me
It's broken
Hello, Joe.
Hello, Cathie.
What are you doing here?
- I'm working here by the river
- You are working?
Joe Taylor condescend to
mix with the working class?
I don't take any pride in it
I see you never
made it to China
- Your flat is still there?
- Yes
I've got a flat mate now
Is she nice?
I don't see her much
Why barge, Joe?
You can find work
more glamorous
Just sort of have it, really
- What about you, you still at the office?
- Yes
Nothing's really changed
Except us
- What did you do with all my stuff?
- I threw them away
As you told me to
I thought I would
never see you again
- Hi gentlemen
- Go, Joe.
- You sure?
- I'm scaling a little
It'll get hot in an hour
Joe, get some sacs of coal
- Tim!
- Easy said than done
We continue?
Put it in the back
of the truck, Joe.
- It's in your truck now
- Thanks
What about the boy
- Will you come to see him?
- He'll be back in school again next week
I have some surprise for you
A banana!
- What should you say?
- Thank you, uncle Sam.
- Thanks
- Will you talk about the naked lady?
- Yes, some pervert has done it
- Me and Joe found her
- You're joking
- We called the police
Will you stop
talking about this?
All talk about it
Drink your tea
Say bye to your dad
- Bye, dad
- Bye, son. Take care of yourself
- Take care
- Bye
You're sad about Tim?
He needs an education.
But when he goes
away It breaks my heart
Think of me when you look at
yourself. With undying love, C.
I had a dream
about you yesterday
I don't think for months
- I think you have gone away
- I had gone away
I shed my own skin
and hide in the fog
I am pregnant
It's yours
Two months has gone
- Two months and you wanted me out of your life?
- This isn't going to happen
Is there anything you
want me to do about it?
I just thought
you should know who
You could marry me and we'll
make wonderful babies together
Kid is not exactly I see it
Why not, Joe? What
are you afraid of?
There's a kid in the barge and I spent every
moment I want to kick him out of the sight
You don't have to be like that
We'll work out intelligently
It's not about us
It's about what
kids do to people
Cathie, I am not someone you
want to marry and you know that
- Have you been seeing anyone else?
- It's your child, Joe.
That doesn't
answer my question
His name is Dan,
he's a plumber
He's nice but I'm not
really interested in him
- He's married anyway
- That's why you said it's mine
It's the truth
I have to get
back to the barge
Don't run away, we can
sort it out together
No, we can't. I'm
not yours anymore
That's not true
We were right,
we were fearless
I was... then.
I have to go
But Joe, what about the baby?
I'll send some money
when I have some
I looked after you
for more than two years
You owe me more...
Bye, Cathie.
- Joe, do you want to get on? - No,
I'll see you at the next lock. - All right.
Look at that, Joe
Daniel Gordon, plumber
of 26 years old in Glasgow
was in custody charged with
murder of Catherine Dimly,
A future actress
Dimly's body was
discovered 2 weeks ago
by two bargemen where they
recovered it from the River Clay
They'll hang that men for sure
Well, we're going to celebrate
Not every day I'm
mentioned in the papers
Here, Joe.
- Joe, I'm going for a beer. Do you want to come?
- No, I'll finish this
Serve yourself
- I see you later
- See you later, Les
Ella. Les will be
back in a minute
He's always late
You scared now?
Do you think he knows?
Of course he does
How long he's been out there?
He must come down and see us
What can we do?
It depends on him really
Why it only depends on him?
There's... anyhow
He surveys the boat as
if it prepared judgment
It's just his way of
knowing we're there
Yes, he's done that
You're just gonna lie here?
There's no hurry.
I finish my cigarette.
I'm sorry, Les
It just happened
There's nothing
personal against you
I just kick you fucking head
I won't fight you, Les. Hit me if
you think it'll make you feel better
What about my son?
What do you think happens to my
son when you are fucking my wife?
- It wasn't like that
- Like what, Joe?
Tell me what it was like
Look, I'll get my stuff
- I leave you to sort it out with Ella.
- This hard fucking barge!
I'll go
So he'll write me a letter?
That's what he said
Do you want a cup of tea?
- Right, I'll do this one
- Me too
Look what we said before
to each other, Joe.
Stop!
Stop! I don't like it. Joe
I can't swim.
You know it. Stop!
I'm scared, I'm
scared, bastard
They've set the
date for that man's trial
FATHER OF TWO TO STAND TRIAL
I thought 4 he has
- What?
- Children. 4 kids
Yes, so did I. It
must be a mistake
Push out the paper
Poor bastard
How? He killed
an innocent woman
You are not the
judge, he didn't do it
What makes you say it?
- It was an accident
- Not what they think
She died without her clothes
so it must be a murder?
Do you want to know how
I know it was an accident?
I thought you were not
interested in all that
I know
I came for my stuff
I'll get it
- How is Jim?
- You know how he is
Go and see him yourself
I thought he was coming
Stay with me for a while
- You want a cup of tea?
- You've got work to do
They asked me as a
witness at the trial
One of us is enough
I cannot tell
them anymore anyway
- You'll say hello to the boy for me?
- Go and see him
We need to find a lawyer
To make things proper again
Les said we have no future
He said once the
ration fuel stops
The truck will take over
But that doesn't bother me
I've spent my
life on the barges
When we save enough
money, if you wish
There is a nice bungalow at
the quiet side of Edinburgh
Wouldn't take
long, would it, Joe?
- What?
- The divorce
I don't know, Ella I don't
know about such things
It will be easier when
Jim's bigger, the three of us
Say hello to Joe
- All right
- Bastard!
Mind you langue!
Your wage. Tax deducted
Board!
Some more
Stay ahead
- What's matter?
- It's Sam, my sister's husband
There has been un accident.
He felt out the lorry, he was killed
It's about a week,
I just got a letter
I sent her a telegram
saying we'll visit her
I see you have a new boyfriend
This is Joe. We're
going to be married
You have to excuse me not being
dressed I was not expecting visitors
Hello, auntie Gwen.
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- I'll help you
Come on, Jim.
Gwen will come to
barge for a week or two
Hope you don't mind, Joe?
Don't want to
spoil your honeymoon
That'll be good for her
She doesn't drink. Can't
understand people who don't drink
If I don't drink
in the morning
I'll be drunk the whole day
Gin's my drink
Not gin in lemonade
Just gin straight
Some people find it
a bit odd but not me
We should get a drink sometimes
Tonight?
We can tell Ella
we go to the cinema
There's one thing I hate
that's going to the dentists
You sure you don't mind, Ella?
- I want to go to the picture
- No, you go
Someone has to stay
and look after the barge
You enjoy yourself
See you later, Ella
Of course I'm sorry for Sam
One did not want it to happen
I didn't have time
to think a lot though
We had to bury him as soon as possible
when the bus killed him
I thought he
fell off the lorry
Yes he did. Then
the bus ran him over
It's about time Ella will look
after ourselves how she is doing
One of your girlfriends?
- Yes, she died
- You still carry her photo
Yes, I don't know why
- I should have get rid of it long time ago
- Of course you should
The dead can't
look after themselves
Drink your cup, we have
business to attend to
Look at the mess
you've made me
Right, that's me
See you love birds
in the morning
Leave me alone, Joe
He killed her,
as simple as that
We'll see what
the judge will say
- The law warranty the justice.
- Yes
You want to know what I thing
of this so-called justice?
Lawyers only play words...
This bastard should be hung!
I agree. If this guy is
guilty he has to be hung
Calm
Hi there
- I suppose you did any writing today?
- Not much
I know you 're
going to finish it
You think it's easy?
I'm trying to do something
different, don't you understand?
- I'm trying something new
- No, I don't understand
Why can't you write an ordinary book?
What other people can't understand
For 8 months I'm been getting
enough sitting in the lousy office
And when I get home
there is a drunker asleep
What have you done today
to earn enough money for us to eat?
- I made some custard
- You did what?
I made some custard
Custard?
I worked whole day
and you made some custard
Yes it tricked me a
good idea, so I made some
- It's over here, on the dresser
- Put it where you like
Eat it yourself
Taste your custard
I put a lot of effort in this
custard and you're going to eat it
- No, you can't do it
- Oh I know I'm going to do it
You... you are a bastard
You bastard
He should serve enough time
Pervert like that
should be fucked
Hanging, it is too easy
If he is guilty, he should die
That's what they say
- When's your birthday, Joe?
- What?
- It's horoscope, I read it for you
- Where's Ella?
Elle's gone.
Come and sit down
What do you mean
Ella's gone darts?
Elle's gone to see Les.
What you think you're doing?
I'm leaving
Should have done
it long time ago
You are going anywhere?
No, I'm leaving
looking for another job
You're looking for
somewhere to stay?
Suppose I am?
- I'll find you a lodger
- I'm not going to stay for long
May be a month
- Well, interested?
- Yes, how much?
introduce you to my wife
I work at night. You'll
see her more than me
You have to pay in advance.
Your room is there
I go to work
I see you in the morning
See you later
Daddy!
I suppose you 're
our last lodger
Get up, he'll be here soon
There were the bargemen who
found her body, isn't it?
- Anyone you know?
- What?
- The bargemen. Did you know them?
- I knew one of them
You have been in a trial?
- No. You?
- No
I don't want to, either
I think I might go along to it
Just to see what
it like, you know
Pencils? Give me
small something
How do you describe your
relationship with the deceased?
We were flat mates, but I don't
know I recently moved in so...
we were friendly
rather than friends
And what do you know her
relationship with the accused?
I think she met him when he
came to fix plumbing in the flat
I only saw him once, so
couldn't really form an opinion
But I know she was lonely
Her last boyfriend
recently has gone to China
Thank you
You should have been rich Joe,
it might have work then
I loved you
Will you write to me?
I'll send you a
letter from China
- You are not going to China
- May be I am
I'm sorry
What's to be sorry about?
It happens
We ran our course
Goodbye, Joe
What you do that for?
I've no use for that
- Must be worth something, no?
- Not to me
I saw him with her
I recognize his face
Thank you. No
further questions.
I'd like to call
Mr. Leslie Gold.
Can you please describe
for us the circumstances
under which you found
the body of the deceased?
We were with a cargo
of coal to be delivered
and I saw a body floating by
and I fished it out, with Joe
- Joe?
- My mate
I see
Was Ms. Dimly dead when you...
- fished her out of the water?
- Yes, she was dead already
Thank you
No further questions
We have no further questions
Thank you, you may step down
So? You think he's guilty?
- The murder is not proved yet
- What do you mean?
They didn't prove that it was
They know that
Woman don't get
undressed for nothing
- She had sex
- You'll see
They'll hang him
Poor beggar
According to the examination
of the deceased's shoes
It was found that they matched
exactly those of the accused
Also the fibers found
under her finger nails
exactly matched the material
of the accused's shirt
There could be no mistakes
The chances that they could belong
to anyone else are practically nill
With the evidence of sexual
activities and the main of reason
in my opinion there is
overwhelming evidence
that the deceased had intimate
contact with the accused
- very shortly before her death
- Objection
These facts do not have
any relevance for the jury
Overruled
I wasn't with
her then. I swear
I never went near the river
Silence! Silence!
Keep order.
Just answer the
question, Mr. Gordon.
What was the question, sir?
What did you do after removing
the deceased's clothes?
I never took her clothes off
We just went for
a walk together
- You was with her
- No, not then
I see
Were you aware that the
deceased was pregnant?
No
No, it wasn't me. No
I didn't. I didn't
- You new she was pregnant?
- No
You planed to get rid of her before
your wife discover your dark secret
No
- She invited you to
her house as a tradesman
She trusted you
as a tradesman
You abused that position of
trust, you preyed on her loneliness
I alone was with Catherine
Dimly at the time she died
I cannot identify myself without
the risk of finding myself
in the same shoes
as Mr. Gordon.
I made a mistake of not
reporting the accident at the time
and I have that
on my conscience
you'll be condemning
an innocent man
Ladies and gentlemen,
who speaks for you?
Have you reached a verdict?
Yes
What is your verdict?
We find the accused
guilty as charged
Is your verdict
unanimous or by majority?
Unanimous
Would the accused please stand
Mr. Gordon, do you have anything to
say before the sentence is passed?
I swear to god I'm innocent
- You thought about the child?
- Silence!
Now clear the court
Mr. Daniel Gordon, you
have been found guilty
Of the murder of
Ms. Catherine Dimly.
After taking in considerations
all the circumstances
of this case
I have no choice but to impose
the maximum penalty
I therefore sentence you to be hang
by the neck until you are dead
May God have
merci on your soul
Take the prisoner out
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury
thank you for your civic duty
All rise!
