HELL
- Like it?
- It's perfect
You have visitors
Are we in the way?
- Are you pleased?
- So far. Want to see?
- That's why we're here
- Follow your guide
Big, isn't it?
You haven't seen half of it.
That's to be my apartment
With two rooms for kids
There's a room almost ready here
It must be costing a packet
It's really comfortable
- I renewed all the bedding
- Where's the money coming from?
Fifteen years of hard-earned savings,
plus what my mother left me
Most of it's thanks to my bank;
I'm in debt to here!
Got a light?
Next year I'll build a
landing-stage here
I'll buy you an electric razor
No, this is perfect
Come here, let me see
He's walking, Nelly, come and look
I know he's walking
The light... I'd rather it was off
Just a bad dream; I won't be long
- "What are you doing here?"
- The kid crying... I can't sleep
I'm sleeping very badly just now
- What are you doing here?
- What was up with him?
Just a bad dream. Come to bed
Coming to bed?
I think you've lost it
- I feel I won't get to sleep all night
- Yes, you will
I'll get a pill for you;
I'm good at that
You work too hard,
so you're over-tired
But you'll sleep with what I gave you
Put out the light
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well
Even my husband, who's so
susceptible to noise
Luckily the planes had a quiet night
That's not all I'm susceptible to
Waking here in the morning is pure joy
Then you must come again
during the season
My husband would really like it
With a month's notice, I can
see you get a good room
The same one, if possible
He's put chocolate on your face
- A bit behind, aren't you?
- Vincent wanted chocolate
- You'll be late for school
- I'm always early
- You'll be right back?
- No, I've things to do
- For the hotel?
- No, for me
Clothilde will be in at ten
to finish the accounts
That's just a curtain-raiser
Open wide, boy
Sleeping pills can backfire on you
Nothing serious this time
What did I tell you?
You can open the curtains, Nelly
He was imagining cancer of the throat
Right now he makes mountains out of
everything, for no reason
I don't do it for fun
He can't relax, that's all
- Relaxing isn't the problem
- What is, then?
I don't know
Here's the prescription
Why not go with the doctor, get the
medicine and collect our car?
- Would you mind, Doctor?
- Not at all, if we go now
Leaving me without a kiss?
Monsieur and Madame Vernon!
We told you we'd come back
I had to juggle, but you've
the same room
Come and see the view, darling
Finished the letters?
No, I was seeing to the insurance
cards first
My wife didn't do that?
She was at the beach
I must get these X-rays to
Madame Point
Please tell that child to do
her aerobatics elsewhere
Your X-rays, Madame Point
Madame Point wants you to
play elsewhere
- Where can I go?
- Try the tarred road, that's smooth
- Have you tried skating on it?
- Yes, well, go on anyway
- Life's too short for abstinence
- I don't abstain
Two cognacs, Julien
And one for the boss
- A drink, Doctor?
- Never on duty, like the cops
Nothing for me, then
I'm going to town; is my car ready?
I'm having the weekend off
- When did Dad say it would be ready?
- Yesterday
So it's ready; you can trust him
The baby's all right?
So Nelly can join us
No, she should stay with him
We were expecting her to join us
It was great this morning
Another time, all right?
Watch out: That's what
having kids means
I'Iljust go and see her
She's busy; go and enjoy yourself
- You're pretty curt with your guests
- She's a friend
I hope she knows that
Vincent's not really ill?
It's your pills that worry me
- I need them to sleep
- Well, just watch it
Not overdoing your drinking?
In this business you can't
always refuse
You've got problems?
Money problems, I mean.
How's business?
As good as can be expected
I'm not ill, Doctor
Are your competitors hurting you?
They're amateurs
But doing well?
Well, it's easy to sweeten the coach-
drivers and serve the customers shit
You sweat blood for years,
setting up a decent business...
...and some ponce muscles in
Where's the justice in that?
You waste no time, Monsieur Duhamel!
It's the magic hour, Monsieur Prieur
Things are already starting to change
- Haven't you a camcorder?
- Never, Monsieur Prieur
Big screen cinema, that's the thing
- What's new?
- The Duchemins called, hopping mad
They should have booked earlier.
I'll write to them
But the Mayor of Villeneuve's
daughter's wedding is on Saturday
- Did my wife speak to him?
- No, I rang her but got no reply
She'll have been with Vincent
No, Julie was looking after him
Never mind... I'll take the medicine up
Paul... what's up?
He was showing me his slides
In the dark?
Yes, they show up better
Did you get the medicine?
Do you know the time? You should be
in the dining-room
Already?
Did you get your car?
Yes, of course
- Out for a bit of air, Monsieur Paul?
- Lovely day, isn't it?
{y:i}Now you know where you are
She didn't look guilty
{y:i}No, she didn't. Do you find that
{y:i}reassuring?
But in the lounge... she's not a fool
"No," she "isn't"
Is the menu to your liking?
No meat at night for me.
May I have an omelette?
- Of course. With ham, herbs, cheese?
- No, just eggs
- We searched everywhere for you
- I went for a walk, didn't feel well
What's wrong?
Just tired; I feel better now
More moonshine!
- Let me carry your things
- No, let me. I was extravagant today
It's the privilege of pretty women
to ruin us
You look better, my pet.
Have you been good?
Angelic
Here's a good cure
What do you say?
Don't ask too much of him
This is yours
- I'll bet it's a nightdress
- See-through!
Thanks for keeping me company
It was a pleasure; think of me
the next time you go
Aren't you putting it on a bit?
He likes to play the gallant.
Where's the harm?
Bathtime, you
No more sore throat?
Give me your other foot
- Did you pay the printer?
- Yes, I went just after lunch
He called at three, wanting his money
I must have arrived just after
You stayed at mother's till three?
Of course not
Weren't you lunching with her?
It's too hot for that
Weren't you lunching with her?
She had a new pupil
Endless scales... so I ate
at the shop with Marilyn
You be a big boy and ask Clothilde
or Marie to cook you something
How about a kiss for daddy?
I feel like a shower. How about you?
What did the customers do
while you ate in the shop?
Nobody turned up
Until three o'clock?
I don't spend my time watching clocks
Now hold on...
Let me have a look
Come into the light
- I don't believe it
- What?
You're jealous
I'm so glad; it proves
you care for me
I'll be catching cold
Don't mind me
Sorry, it was pure curiosity
- Nice, isn't it?
- Must have cost a packet, though
Guess
Where would I get that much?
Dry me, instead of talking nonsense
- What "did" it cost?
- You never let an idea go, do you?
You bet I'm surprised
Old Montignac took some beating down
- There's mail?
- A letter from my brother
- Where is he right now?
- In Germany, at Koblenz
I'll take the stamp to my dressmaker
for her son
- Where are you going?
- My mother's
- Again?
- To help. I told you she wasn't well
You told me that?
The doctor's right; you're not well
My bus! Call and say I'm coming
My wife's just coming
{y:i}Alibi
Don't do it, watch out
Don't do it, watch out for yourself
{y:i}Now, if she's not ather mother's,
{y:i}you'll know
She's out, giving a lesson in town
Daydreaming as usual
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for mother
- I thought she wasn't well
- You know that doesn't stop her
Why are you here? Is Vincent ill?
No, I was just passing
Why?
I was at the Hoteliers' Association
I don't want to seem picky, but
that's across town. Where's the car?
Place Jeanne d'Arc
The bus terminal
Could you be following me?
Have I any reason to?
No, but I could arrange it if you like
This is silly; let's drop it
Say something nice
- Is your brother still liking Germany?
- He sends his love
What else? Treat me to some of
his deathless prose
How stupid... Mum has it
She was out
- I put it through her letter-box
- You think fast... like the handbag
It cost 4,000 francs.
I called Montignac
Such trust you have
The fact is, I won on the horses
You gamble?
From time to time
Why didn't you tell me?
You'd have blamed Marilyn
Where did you place the bet?
The café across the bridge
They're closed this week
Granny died. Water's leaking, too
Is that you, Paul?
It's all finished, nothing left.
I'm closing
What's wrong, Paul?
Are you ill? An accident?
Answer me... say something
Where have you been?
You scare me, just standing there
Can I help?
Do you want to be on your own?
What is it, Paul?
We looked everywhere for you,
on the road, by the lake...
...in town, the police station,
the hospital
I was hanging on to the phone
Weeping like a fountain
All our guests looked, found nothing...
I couldn't bear to see them return
Then night fell...
You're here, you're here!
My poor Nelly. I saw you and
Martineau, on the river
What of it?
Please, I don't want to talk about it.
I followed you, isn't that enough?
When you landed, was it to play cards?
I saw you... I "saw" you
Saw what? Is that why you
ran off like a maniac?
Why I've been shaking all day,
and you're in this state?
Yes, we landed on the island...
...because I needed a rest
Lying on the grass
No, standing on one leg!
Look at me, you fool!
Can't you see I love you,
that I'm your wife?
Look at my eyes... it's for you
I've been crying
What if he doesn't come back,
I thought. Without him I'm nothing
No, you don't love me any more.
Leave me alone
If I didn't love you,
I wouldn't be here
I wanted to die, too...
do you hear me?
It hurts so
Hush, it's all over now.
I'm here and I love you
Come on, darling
What are you dreaming?
No, it's over... it's all over
- Back already?
- I haven't time to waste
- Can I christen it?
- Of course
It must have cost
I'll go and change
Sorry, the weekends are fully booked
No. 4 is free. Martineau phoned
to cancel
These shirts won't last another winter
It's full of holes
When did Martineau call?
I said that for Clothilde's sake.
"I" called "him"
I told him not to come back, right?
This pillowcase has had it
I said he was nice, but
too full of himself
He got the point, all right
What will people think,
you calling him?
That I'm scared and leave
the dirty work...
...to you?
I couldn't let you suffer
So you make me a laughing-stock?
Martineau's got himself snagged,
for once
He won't say a word
That's what you think
So your love depends on
what people think?
Keep your jewels
Help me
Don't... I was wrong
It won't come off, anyway
Who said you could take my doll?
- You're mean
- You're the nasty one
Your boy's a poet, says it's a train
- What's wrong?
- He took my doll
Children squabbling over their toys?
Just hold it, right there
It's my doll
Couldn't you lend it?
What a pest
It's the magic hour, Monsieur Prieur
Sorry, I've work to do
Where's he off to?
He's so busy, Monsieur Duhamel
Lights, please!
I'll only be a second
Choc-ices, caramels...
Is there much more?
It's the last reel
Look at that zoom!
Pity Martineau's not here
I filmed his garage
A real star turn
You ought to be in films
- That's you!
- Yes, the day mother was ill
Less than I wanted...
...but I couldn't follow them
{y:i}Have the courage to face the truth
A narrow squeak, my love
You can't come again,
he's watching me
I'll spin a yarn and
we can meet in town
Yes, I'll alert Marilyn
Stop it... yes, of course I want to...
Stop it, for God's sake!
What's got into you?
Don't worry, he'll get over it
Forgive me... forgive me
Proud of yourself?
What will people think?
You don't care, do you?
Duhamel wanted to leave.
He's staying, but not for you
I told him you'd been drinking
Am I entitled to an explanation?
Talk to me, Paul
I'm jealous
Jealous of whom? Of what?
I don't know, but it's killing me
It's killing me
I almost jumped from the window
I can't bear to see you like this,
Paul. Hit me if you want
I'd prefer that
But it's inside me, I know that
You're exhausted, my love,
come and get some sleep
You think I can sleep?
Just relax... let yourself go
Have you seen Martineau again?
Oh really, Paul, I was asleep
Have you seen him again?
No, because I called to say
not to come again
Because it's dangerous here
So you see him in town.
That's logical, isn't it?
Yes, it's logical, but it's untrue
Can you prove it?
How can I?
If you won't be reasonable,
let me do it for both of us
It bothers you if I go into town?
Then I won't. Ever
Not ever?
Not ever
Feel better now?
Sort of
- What more can I do?
- It's too late; what's done is done
But what did I do?
You can ask after your island trip?
Not that again. I told you
I was tired and had to rest
- Aren't you drinking too much?
- I'm cold
- I'm cold, too
- You want some?
So you had a rest?
- For half-an-hour?
- No, for five minutes
Wrong. You left at 11.30,
I arrived on the stroke of midday
Listen...
One last time. We left at 11.30...
...and had a rest on the island...
...that's true, but it was
because I was tired
- So you lay down in the grass
- I did not lie down in the grass
You're lying
I'm sick of your lies. Come on,
you're going to tell me the truth
All right, so I slept with Martineau...
...on the island, in his car, at his
place, on our bed. Now are you happy?
Open up
I was wrong
I'm past that now... I love you
Don't be silly... let me in
Idiot
Got my lambs, boss?
I left them at the butcher's. I'll
call him... my head's like a sieve
I'm so sorry
You're leaving? Nothing wrong
at home, I hope
Wrong here, I'd say, with
that row last night
Take their luggage to their car
Anyone can drink too much, but
with a sweet girl like that...
Good morning, all
- How are you, Nelly dear?
- Fine, thanks
I doubt if you slept well
That happens
- Stop it
- I'm an aeroplane
Vincent, please, I've a headache
Make me some bread-and-butter, Dad
Bread-and-butter
Can you take him to his grandmother
later?
Who, me?
Since I can't go out
- Have what you like... on the house
- How nice and how unusual
- Going for a walk?
- Is getting a breath of air forbidden?
I can't see Mum or Marilyn,
or take my son out
For two weeks you've kept
an eye on me
No, I can't take it any more
You want to pick a fight with me,
well, I'll give you cause
I don't know how or who with,
but I will
Are you saving on lights?
It'll be our pensions next
- The fuses?
- No, it's the region
It was the same during the last storm
- Have a drink with us, boss
- Thanks, but I must see to this
It's really no joke... it's been
like this for an hour
- What do they say?
- The number's still engaged
Trust French workers to strike
No, it's a power cut
- Seen my wife?
- Not for a while
Thirty-five minutes I've been
calling you
I know you're busy, but...
Isn't Mum here?
I don't know
As you see, just us menfolk
Mama's gone, vanished into the night
Move over, I'll play you something
It's good news... I hope
They say it won't be long now
Vanished into the night...
providential night
- Won't you come in?
- Is this really the moment?
- You're always so rushed
- Yes, I'm always rushed
- About time, too
- Sorry, I can't be everywhere
Is my husband coming soon?
I saw you sniggering together
He didn't say
- Oh, sorry, sir!
- What's wrong?
It's our customers...
they have wandering hands
- You startled me
- What were you doing in there?
A candle for the new guest, the
captain. What a night to arrive
- Why did you go in?
- He asked me to
- You didn't with the others
- Yes, but he was in bed
I wasn't to know. It's no better,
is it?
- What was he doing in bed?
- Waiting for me
Isn't it over, Paul?
You're right, it's stupid
I love you
You'd better hurry, Monsieur Chabert
- Your wife will be grumbling
- I'm used to that
Clothilde, send Vincent up for supper
You've got candle grease on
your skirt... on the back
I must have done that in the cellar
- You went to the cellar?
- Yes, to check the fuses
- Julien said he did that
- We had the same idea
- Now my ceiling's wet. What a country!
- The idiots didn't close the skylights
{y:i}They're all after her
Were you in the loft today?
No, why?
You're lying
Think carefully: Were you
in the loft today?
Oh yes, looking for lamps
- Alone
- Yes, alone
You're lying. Where's your bracelet?
- What bracelet?
- The one I gave you
- Lost
- When?
I don't know, a day or two ago
Liar
You're lying. I found it in the loft
Where is it?
- You're pathetic
- Be quiet
Every time you open your mouth
you lie
Yes, I lie, because I'm
sick of your scenes...
...worrying what to say
or not to say
Don't touch me
I'll say anything to end
your questions
Yes, I lie and I couldn't care less
You hate me? Go on, say you hate me
If I had money enough for Vincent
and my mother, I'd leave you
I can't believe that.
Is that why you stayed?
Why do you think I married you?
I don't believe that...
I can't believe you there
I'm sorry, but I'm all out.
Go to sleep
Yes, it's Paul
- Congratulations, the bird has flown
- What bird?
What on earth has got into you?
You're rich, so you can screw
the innkeeper's wife?
Try to calm down. Where is your wife?
You're asking me? What's "that," then?
That's nothing, just Lenoir...
...joining me for a game of cards
after dinner. Be serious, man
Don't make a joke of it
You've all taken advantage of me long
enough. Tomorrow: Everyone out!
You're really beginning to
get up my nose
First thing tomorrow I'm off,
and I won't be back
Now get out
If I ever kill myself,
it'll be on your conscience
Paul, don't play the fool
Be reasonable
Where have you been?
Me? Where have "you" been?
I was letting the cat in
Seeing Duhamel on the way
I know; I was there just now
You're crazy, Paul
You want every last one of them,
don't you? Old, young, employees
I have my rights, I'm going to
exercise them now
Stop it, Paul, please
{y:i}Forget the sweet talk
{y:i}Don'tlisten to the tart
Bitch!
I know she came here because she left
this on my pillow. You're hiding her
Sit down
You could be held responsible
for her desertion
I could have you charged
Come and sit down
I mustn't be angry, but if she
leaves me I have nothing
I can't live without her
Stay calm
Please give her back, Doctor
Come, Nelly, don't be afraid
What do I owe you for your labours?
Stop joking. You hurt Nelly...
...and I had to examine her
You've had your fill, I see
Go on like this and I'll
have you locked up
She's sick and I get locked up.
That's a good one
Don't get the idea that
I'll take this lying down
You may not think so,
but I know my rights
Arbitrary sequestration,
that's not on
Do you get me?
Don't you realize she's lying
to both of us?
She's a born liar
You beat her, Paul
I slapped her once in
six years of marriage
She asked for it,
and I'll do it again
You nearly maimed her
You have no idea what I went through
At first I believed her,
but then realized...
...and forgave her
But getting out of bed to meet lovers
in the attic, that's unforgiveable
What is one supposed to do?
It took me a long time to catch her,
because she's cunning
She'd pretend to sleep...
...but I'd programme myself
to wake up
Her feet would feel frozen
Proof she'd been up, see?
But, Doctor...
Quiet, let him talk;
this is interesting
It's not her fault. She loves me
in her way
But when the fit takes her,
it's anywhere and with anyone
She is sick
Just look at her... it's
undermining her health
It's hysteria
She's hysterical
Maybe you find this hard to believe?
No, I believe you, Paul
But it's monstrous... he is mad
There's your proof: Now she
wants me locked up
Yes, this demands immediate attention
See? What did I tell you?
- I'm calling the clinic
- Clinic? What for?
She needs a psychiatrist
Dumesnil? Arnoux here. I've a case
for you, same as last week
The husband's told me
a very revealing story
You understand? Yes, it's urgent
Really urgent
I'll bring them both tomorrow
Neither of us is going to any clinic
It's tough, Nelly, but
there's no other way
I'll protect you, Nelly.
They can't force us
I'll call for you,
seven tomorrow morning
I'll set the alarm for six
If it makes you happy
It doesn't, but we're getting up early
Look at this
Maybe I could give you another chance
I forgive you
It'll be like before
But be careful
I'll be severe; any lapse
and you're under lock and key
Can I have two sleeping pills?
Sleeping pills? Why two?
I need sleep. So do you
I need advice from no one
Do as you like, then
He told you not to upset me?
- Who?
- Arnoux
No, I've been here since
this afternoon
You could have telephoned
You can ask Clothilde if you like.
Come on, let's wake her
It was I who locked it
Do you mind?
Mind if I take precautions?
In case you start prowling
the bedrooms again
I know what your game is,
begging me to go to sleep
Listen, Paul... Vincent is feverish,
I must go to him
Will you let me out?
I'll give you two minutes
Give me the key now
The key, or I'll yell
One step and I yell for help
Haven't you caused enough trouble?
Give it to me
Poor Nelly, Arnoux was right
You're not normal
I'm waiting
Well played!
We'll see about this
You should trust me.
I wasn't long, was I?
Want to know about Vincent?
- Is Vincent all right?
- Yes, Vincent is all right
Don't sulk. Can I have the key back?
Listen, I'm tired
So you won't mind me locking up.
I'd feel safer
- Didn't I take my sleeping pills?
- Seems not. Can I have it back?
The key!
All right, I'll sleep in the armchair,
in front of the door
That'll leave you fresh
for leaving early
I won't be going
- You're leaving me to go alone?
- Don't worry, you're not going either
- But if I'm ill...
- Home remedies suit your illness best
A good beating will do it
You can enjoy stripping off
for the doctors next time
Arnoux can lump it
You can tell him tomorrow
No, because I won't be seeing him
Telephone's confiscated
- Are you scared?
- I'm not scared
I'm neither mad nor a monster;
get that into your head
I know, Paul
Then why try to call a doctor
at this hour?
I can't take any more
A great fiddle, that clinic
I'm talking to you.
Did you think I'd go?
Fell for it, didn't you? But
you won't get me; I'll fight
First, give me that key. Where is
that key, for God's sake?
Where is that key, for God's sake?
In the corridor, under the statuette
{y:i}She's been telling fibs
"Doctor"... "they're here. He's shut us"
{y:i}in, the key's under the carpet
{y:i}He's mad. I'll let them in
{y:i}when he falls asleep
{y:i}Wild beasts should be trussed
So you want to let them in?
You asked for it, slut!
{y:i}Doctor? He's tied me up. Come quickly
{y:i}and break the door down
My poor darling
Wake up, my love. It's six o'clock...
do you hear?
I'm so sleepy
You can sleep in the car. We can't
waste any more time. Come on, baby
Open your eyes. Arnoux will be
here soon
What happened?
Nothing. Come on
It's dark. I'm scared when it rains
Yes, it's raining, but don't worry,
I'll drive carefully. We must hurry
Wipe your face, it'll waken you up.
I'll run a bath for you
Get a move on, my love
Don't push me, let me get used to it
Why are you looking at me as if
you'd never seen me before?
I haven't, not like today.
It's been so long, like a dream
If only that were true
It is true
Isn't it obvious?
It's been so long... I thought
everything was lost
There's nothing to cry about
I'm not... I'm happy and
I'm not crying
We'll start all over again
- Wait till I get back from Clermont
- You really want to go now?
You bet, as soon as possible
It's true, Paul
I can't wait to be safe
{y:i}Your wound has reopened
"Look"...
But I'd untied her
What's happening to me?
We were on the point of leaving
for the clinic at Clermont...
...both of us
But we're still here
It's like before
Like before what?
I no longer know... I'm lost
I only hope she isn't thinking of...
I must get my ideas straight...
Must be careful... mustn't...
...if I should ever...
Let me see...
WITHOUT END
