Sailing team one,
man the 60s.
"Enchanter.
Mobile."
Well, we're a long way
from home.
Wake them up!
Enchanter...
Heave to,
and prepare to be boarded.
Enchanter, you are
a U.S. flag ship,
and we are going to
board you.
Heave to now.
Muster your crew
on the bow.
O.K. Hold it there.
Randall, come with me.
Stay where you are.
Kneel down!
Captain.
Captain?
Go ahead, Senior Chief.
It's a bad one.
I think you
better send over
Jack, come on in.
How high is the pile
on your desk?
About this high.
Now it's this high.
What have you got?
You heard about that business
in the South Caribbean.
I need the full skinny.
By when?
As soon as you can.
O.K.
Jack, be discreet.
What do you mean?
You'll find out.
Mysterious.
Oohh...
Ha ha ha!
I love a mystery.
Ryan, John P.
Let him through.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You know
where you're going?
Yep. Thank you.
Oh, where
do I park?
Right, uh, over there.
Thank you.
I'm in passageway,
going forward.
Past the stateroom.
Got blood on the deck.
were recovered,
as well as the, uh...
as the two weapons
that fired them.
And blood samples taken
consistent with
the crew--
Hardin and his wife
and his son
and daughter.
There's some blood up there
on the mirror, too.
They were killed
in their staterooms,
apparently
as they slept.
Dragged topside
and thrown overboard.
The two men in custody
surrendered
after a brief attempt
to outrun the Coast Guard.
What do we know
about them--
the men in custody?
Half a dozen arrests
for drug trafficking
in Bogota, Mr. President.
Drugs...
Suspected ties
to the Cali cartel,
- not Medellin...
You all right,
James?
...according to DEA.
- Why?
- Nothing exotic, sir.
Straight piracy
and murder.
It's not
the first time.
It's the first time
it was a friend of mine.
Yes, sir.
What was that in there?
You all right?
Yeah.
I haven't slept
in 36 hours.
I make any sense?
What did you say?
Just kidding.
Good job.
You ought to give
diplomacy lessons,
Bobby.
I call it how I see it.
That's my job.
James!
And he's yours.
I promised
the American people
I would do something
about the drugs
pouring into this country.
We support
the Colombians' efforts
against the cartels
with equipment and--
And have accomplished
nothing!
We're powerless?
ls that what they think?
They think they can
keep doing this,
and there's
no response, ever.
Are you suggesting
a course of action, sir?
The course of action
I'd suggest
I'm, uh...not sure
where that leaves us.
These drug cartels
represent
a clear and present
danger
to the national
security
of the United States.
Ma, viene gente!
Cortez! Cortez!
?Como estas?
Aqui estoy.
Esperando.
?Ves? Toma.
Andale, pues...
estoy listo...
That doesn't
surprise me.
It should at least
concern you.
What will they do?
Come after me?
Arrest me?
You're scaring me.
for me to tell you
something important?
Thank you.
Listen, you pay me
to counsel you,
and I am counseling you.
I'm keeping you alive
with information.
If you disregard
my counsel
and keep running
your business
the way
you have been--
two things will happen--
I'll quit,
and you'll get killed.
You forgot
to tell me
about your
scouting trip.
No, I didn't.
You made
another contact.
Who is he?
Castro asked me
the same question
about my sources,
and I always gave him
the same answer.
But Castro
didn't pay you
what I pay you.
This one will cost you
nothing.
A woman.
You're
using a woman.
Ha ha ha!
It won't float!
John, what do you want,
toast or--
Waffles!
Anybody seen
my keys?
Pancakes!
Toast, please.
Bye, Dad!
Bye, pal.
Hello. Yes.
It shouldn't float.
It's a submarine.
It goes under water.
Jack.
Hello.
When?
I thought I had
the flu.
I'd still think
I had the flu
if they weren't
telling me otherwise.
Well, what are they
telling you?
Pancreatic cancer
of an aggressive nature,
if I heard them right.
Jesus.
Well, uh,
what does that mean?
I guess it means
I'm in big trouble.
No, I mean,
can they operate?
Maybe. That's what
they said--maybe--
but it sounds
suspiciously like no to me.
There's one of them now.
Hey!
I'm not dead yet.
But I am in
the hospital,
which means
that I'm not
in my office.
I don't know
what's going on.
I need you there.
Where?
In my office,
doing my job.
Oh, wait. I--
I hate not knowing
what's going on, Jack.
I wouldn't know
anything about your job.
You've been around.
No big mystery.
You've been to
the White House.
Once. I hated it.
No, you didn't.
Want to know
about politics
in Washington?
Four words--
Watch your back,
Jack.
Bobby!
You should be
the first to know.
Or I guess
the third or fourth.
I'm appointing Ryan
the Acting Deputy Director
of lntelligence.
It'll be a provisional
appointment
until James recovers.
Get him up to speed
on our aid program
to the Colombians.
He's got to talk
the Oversight Committee
out of another
$75 million.
And not make a fool
out of himself.
What's happening on
the Hardin murders?
I'm on it.
The President's calling
for a full-court press.
hand in hand.
That's great.
Margaret.
Why don't we leave
all his things?
O.K.
Ryan...
I can't believe it!
Not a team player,
is that what
you're saying?
Not a team player.
He's a Boy Scout.
A goddamn Boy Scout--
Believes in loyalty,
cleanliness, and knot tying.
So leave him
out of it.
He's the Deputy
Director
of lntelligence,
James.
It's going to be
a little tricky.
What does he
need to know?
Nothing.
He needs
to know nothing.
He's going to know
nothing.
I want a copy
of the President's
authorization
of this
new action
against
the cartels.
You want what?
You heard me.
He doesn't know
about it.
Let me explain it
to you very simply.
This is your deal,
not mine.
So unless I have
written authorization,
this thing is over
before it begins.
I won't be
the only one left
without a chair
when the music stops.
Reciprocity.
That's a clever name
for it.
Revenge is a very, very,
very dangerous
motivation.
Are you able to handle
this operation or not?
What I'm looking for
is a simple yes or no.
You're looking for
a political mess.
Yes or no?
Is that
what they want?
They want
what every first-term
administration wants--
a second term.
I don't imagine
the boys on the Hill
have approved this.
Senor, la cuenta,
por favor.
Have they?
Is that a no?
La cuenta.
Shit.
I want the money
in my account
before I move
an inch.
You got it.
- I'll need a Comsat link.
- You got it.
An insertion team.
You can have
a brigade.
I just need 12 men
who understand
discretionary warfare--
Special Ops people,
Spanish speaking.
Cutter will get
the military.
How are you today, sir?
Very well.
What is the purpose
of your visit?
Business.
What kind of business
are you in?
And how long
will you be staying?
A few days.
Hi.
Of course
it's a risk,
but what's
the alternative?
Zapping a retina
with 6,000 rads of cobalt?
That's not pretty.
Prettier than
a tumor
spreading in
the cranial sac.
What is her name?
I'm trying to eat!
Listen, um...hungry?
Starved.
Because we could
forget about lunch.
Oh, we did that
last time, remember?
Do I remember?
Do you?
Vaguely.
Maybe I should
refresh your memory.
Maybe you should.
Excuse me.
Your table
is ready.
Give it to
somebody else.
Moira?
I thought that was you.
How's Jack?
He's great,
just great.
You still with
the FBl?
In the Director's
Office.
Who was that?
My friend--
Senor Roberto Landa.
Doesn't he
look like Jack?
Oh, does he?
I can't quite see.
Only Latin.
A Latin Jack Ryan?
This I must see.
I have to go. Bye.
Well, we know
it's not piracy.
These guys had plane tickets,
Miami to Bogota
the morning after
the killings.
How's it going?
We're sneaking up
on a motive.
Dan Murray--Bureau.
Ralph
Williams--DEA.
Said anything yet?
Yeah. "We're
innocent."
Till the D.A.
offers a deal.
He already
has.
Regular
or extra crispy.
He was either
referring
to fried chicken
or the electric
chair.
What are you
picturing here?
A hit
on a respectable
American businessman
and his family?
You're assuming
he's respectable.
We have...
memos, letters,
credit card
statements...
and we got
personal income tax...
Article of
lncorporation.
Everything
you need
to break
his code.
What's this?
Yearbook.
Sweethearts,
football team.
Ah, you think?
I don't know.
O.K. Let's see
what we've got here.
No cream.
Wasn't any cream.
People are big
on birthdays.
Bet your ATM code
is your birthday.
Close.
In reverse?
Ha ha ha!
All right.
His birthday is...
It'd be too easy,
wouldn't it?
Let's try it
in reverse.
No.
Twice.
No.
This could
take...
months.
Months.
Son's in reverse.
This is for you.
No.
Wife's in reverse.
Hmm.
Daughter's in reverse.
You got to change
your ATM code.
No.
Daughter's...
No.
Wife...
Got it. Ha!
I got it!
Ha ha ha!
Right here.
Ha ha ha!
Wife's birth month,
daughter's day,
son's year,
not in reverse.
Sorry.
Print me up
that one, will you?
Yes, sir.
My boy.
And then
three years ago,
Hardin received a large infusion
of foreign investment capital,
which he invested wisely
in 20 major shopping centers.
I say wisely because
in the middle of the recession,
he posted record profits--
at least to the IRS,
who he apparently feared
more than his own partners.
To them--according
to stockholder statements
he was giving them--
the shopping centers weren't
doing nearly as well.
They were. He was just skimming
the lion's share
of the profits--$650 million--
and putting it in accounts
in Luxembourg, Panama,
and the Cayman lslands.
They killed him
for it.
Who?
His partners.
Who were his partners?
Well, it seems clear
that, uh...
he was
laundering money
for the Colombian
drug cartels.
Jesus!
I knew the man for 40 years.
We went to school together.
We almost went into
business together.
That would have
been good.
The press is going
to have a field day.
No one outside
this room
knows
anything about it.
They will.
They always do.
It'll come out.
You're right.
But when it does,
we'll downplay
your relationship
with Hardin somehow.
Hmm.
What?
What?
Defuse it.
What? You disagree?
No.
Well, actually, yes.
I would go in
the other direction.
If a reporter asked
if you were friends,
I'd say, "No.
We're good friends."
If they asked if you
were good friends,
I'd say, "We're
lifelong friends."
Give them
no place to go,
nothing to report,
no story.
I mean, there's,
uh, no sense
defusing a bomb
after it's already...
it's already
gone off.
That shit!
You see him?
All right.
Move your team
That's it.
Stop.
Touch that light-colored grass.
Sniper at your feet.
There's nothing here,
Sergeant Major.
Damn!
He is good.
That was close.
How's he moving
so fast?
I see him.
Come in. Straight in.
Now! Run!
Keep coming!
Stop.
To your left.
To your left.
And stop.
Sniper at your feet.
Or what is it?
He had lunch here,
Sergeant Major.
McDonald's
Quarter Pounder,
with cheese.
Damn.
Damn!
That's four.
All right, you won
this one. Come on out.
Soldier, how did you get
that close to me?
Sniper approached
the instructor
by being
a sneaky bastard,
Sergeant Major!
Do you know the fine
for littering
in California, Chavez?
Yes, sir!
I saw you on
the sniper course.
You looked good.
Just about
finished here, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.
Looking forward
to taking leave
with that young
wife and kids?
I don't have any
wife and kids, sir.
What do you have?
I mean, you don't
call anybody
with great frequency,
don't write
many letters,
don't receive 'em.
Who are you, sir,
if you don't mind my asking?
Mr. Clark and I
are putting together
a special mission,
my team'll be a part of it.
You'd be gone
a couple months,
after which,
if you're not dead,
you'd have your choice
of assignments
in Special Ops.
Mr. President, do you
have a comment on...
Mr. President!
Mr. President.
That appears
to be defusing an issue
snowballing
into yet another scandal.
The Times
is reporting
you and Hardin
were good friends.
Is that true?
No. We weren't
good friends.
We were
lifelong friends.
I said that.
I said that.
I told him
to say that.
What?
I didn't say anything.
Yeah, but you're
thinking something.
No.
I was distracted
by how much trouble
you were having with
your ensemble today.
Well, it's not every day
you have to look trustworthy.
Told who to say
what, Dad?
It's not important.
I can walk myself.
The President?
Yeah.
Mom says she
makes more money
than the President.
She's probably
right.
Bye.
Thank you, Dr. Ryan,
for the information you've
shared with us this afternoon.
Thank you, Senator.
I agree we have to help
the Colombians
in their struggles to curtail
the drug cartels' activities,
however I'm confused.
How do you see
additional funds alone
advancing this program
from the utter failure it is?
You see what
I'm getting at.
No, I'm afraid
I don't.
You said this effort
would be benign on our part.
The finding
clearly states
that our assistance
is limited
to supply and advice
only, Senator.
I've also read
a similar finding
written 35 years ago
regarding a sliver of jungle
in Southeast Asia.
I'm sorry.
You're comparing
our request
for supplemental
antidrug funds
to Vietnam?
I'm comparing it
to every instance
a legislative body
renders judgment based on
less than all the facts.
I don't know
what to say to that.
You could assure us
we have been
given all the facts.
I thought I had.
Assure us, then,
that this increase
in funds--
this escalation,
to use your word--
will not be used
for covert
military action.
I don't know how
you're getting to this.
Long experience,
sir.
No troops, then.
I enunciate
that clearly
because I don't want
any mistake.
No troops.
You could say I have
your word on that?
You could, indeed,
because you do.
I'm going
down to 3.
Roger.
Listen up!
Dog tags!
Take 'em off,
pass 'em forward.
Check your pockets
for anything
that can be used
for identification.
We're feet dry.
LZ in sight.
Get ready.
Good luck, boys.
Go get 'em.
Let's take her
down now.
Go! Go! Go!
Hey, Bob.
How you doing?
Good, sir.
Good to see you.
Good morning, Jack.
Yes, yes.
Coffee, bagel?
Coffee.
Black, please.
How is
the family?
Um, good, sir.
When do I meet
the other Dr. Ryan?
She's dying to
meet you, sir.
Good. Good.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So...
The cash is
still there, hmm?
Sir?
In Hardin's
offshore accounts.
$650 million.
And change.
And change. And we have
the account numbers.
Yes, sir.
Well, what are
we waiting for?
Let's get it.
Let's get it?
Let's turn
this thing around.
$650 million
and change.
It's worth
in political
capital.
What?
Uh, well, um...
this connection
between Hardin
and the cartels
is a theory.
Theory?
A theory of mine.
Theory?
Well, I know
the money is there.
Who exactly Hardin
was working for,
I don't know
that exactly,
and we would have to
establish that
before we could
seize the money.
So go down there
and establish it.
Go where?
Colombia.
Who, me?
I leave you alone
for two weeks,
and you walk into
a big bear trap.
I don't know what
I was thinking.
You were thinking
about impressing
the President,
and you shouldn't
do that.
November.
January.
Of last year.
There's a guy down there,
Ieast there used to be--
Clark.
We go way back.
Good man.
You hit a brick wall,
look him up.
Admiral Greer.
Chemotherapy.
Ah, shit.
Here we go again.
How is Ritter
behaving?
Ritter? Oh,
Ritter is Ritter.
He's leaving
me alone.
Are you sure?
Watch him like a hawk.
How you
feeling today, Admiral?
Okey-dokey.
It's just going
to take a few minutes,
and we'll get you
back to your room
and all comfortable.
Still a little bit
of nausea from yesterday?
Variable,
this is Knife.
Stand by to copy.
Over.
This is Knife.
Stand by to copy. Over.
Knife,
this is Variable.
Your signal is
five by five. Over.
Clear.
The chicken is
in the pot. Over.
Cook it.
Roger that.
Honey!
I'm late.
Bye.
Have
a good trip.
I'm not going to
say it.
Don't.
Be careful.
And local time is, uh...
well, actually,
it's the same as Washington.
It's 11:16 a.m.
There'll be a temperature
of about 69 degrees Fahrenheit.
Dr. Ryan!
Dr. Ryan!
DEA Special Agent
Jean Fowler.
Hi, Jean.
First time in Bogota, right?
Let's not stand here
and let somebody
take a shot at you.
Hell, you just
got here.
Come on, sir.
Let's go.
These two are--
They're brothers.
Brothers.
Don't do that.
Give Dr. Ryan
more air back here,
please.
Bulletproof.
We don't have
a picture.
Escobedo's
lntelligence Officer.
Invisible man, huh?
Gently, gently
with your hands.
Luis, put
your hands together!
No! Your hands!
Together!
Good. Good.
Luis,
watch the canter!
Now trot.
Yes!
Very good!
Ha ha ha ha!
Press
with your legs.
Yes.
We lost
another plane.
Now go to
a shorter trot.
O.K.
Who is doing this?
If I had to guess?
That's not
what I asked you.
I can guess.
Someone has been talking
to the drug police.
Now, that's impossible.
If anyone spoke
to the police,
I would know.
Ernesto.
You think
one of the others
after what I did
to the American?
That wasn't quite
the deterrent
you thought
it would be.
Find out who it is.
What do you make
of this, Colonel?
An opportunity.
An opportunity, Sipo.
Good afternoon.
Afternoon.
Messages, please.
Dr. Ryan.
Clark.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got
O.K.
I'm positive
that Hardin
was tied
into the cartels.
It's definitely
drug money.
But you can't
prove it.
So far.
Mind if I ask you
a question?
No.
Why are you
telling me all this?
I've been out of the game
for a long time.
Oh. Well, I was told
you were
wired in down here,
that you knew
the town,
Who told you that?
Jim Greer.
How's he doing?
Well, he's not good.
It's cancer...
terminal.
He's a good man.
The best.
You a coffee drinker,
Dr. Ryan?
Yeah, I like coffee.
Try the Lindo brand.
Lindo.
I think
you'll like it.
Mr. President,
I've got some good news.
Good.
Hardin's partner
down here
was someone you may
have heard of--
Ernesto Escobedo.
That figures.
Now, is this
another
of your
theories, Ryan?
No. I think we can
call this one fact.
Escobedo, like every other
drug lord down here,
was also running
legitimate businesses,
and Hardin
was doing business
with these businesses,
importing,
among other things,
coffee,
which in and of itself
means nothing,
but he was
paying too much
for this coffee--
$6,200 a pound,
if my arithmetic
is correct.
Well, that's
expensive coffee.
Yes, sir.
I'd agree.
This is good news.
Um, sir...
I have other news
which isn't so good.
Oh, God.
Um...DEA here feels
that the Colombian government
would want
the seized funds...
This is our money.
We found it.
We could try
telling them that.
Try? Tell them!
Or don't.
I don't care.
With all due respect--
Tell them
this is our money.
I wouldn't know
what to say.
I'm not a negotiator.
Don't you know someone
in their government?
I went to school with
their Attorney General.
Jacobs will come down.
He'll take care of it.
This is our money.
Thank--
Thank you.
I hate this job.
Uh!
Eyes up!
Demo team, up!
Device set!
Fire in the hole!
Let's go!
Move out!
Down! Down!
Whoever did this
is dead.
Whoever did this
to me is dead!
Do you hear me?
Are you
listening to me?
We'll go over it
on the plane again.
Mr. Jacobs,
could you sign these?
Moira...
why don't you
call in sick
tomorrow?
And the next day.
I won't
tell anybody.
Just because
you're not here
doesn't mean
there's nothing to do.
Your itinerary.
You work too hard.
Adios.
Director Jacobs'
office.
Oh, yes. Hello.
All right.
Uh...l do have
a tentative
schedule.
Landa y Landa.
Roberto Landa, please.
This is Moira Wolfson.
One moment, please,
Ms. Wolfson.
I'll see
if I can find him.
He's on
the factory floor.
Yes.
A Moira Wolfson
is calling.
I told her you were
on the factory floor.
O.K.
Go ahead.
Moira.
Hi. You free in the next
couple of days?
The next
couple of days?
I am.
My boss is leaving
the country.
Um...
can I call you
later?
O.K.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon,
Mr. President.
Good news
in the fight against drugs.
I wish to announce
that an investigation
by the Department
of Justice
has identified
several bank accounts
from Luxembourg
to the Cayman lslands
used for laundering
drug money
on an unprecedented scale.
In cooperation with five
foreign governments,
we have taken
the necessary steps
to seize those funds,
which amount
to over $650 million.
Ah, shit.
Also to seize 20 real-estate
joint-venture investments
here in the United States,
which were
the primary agencies
in the laundering
operations.
Mr. President,
you did say
$650 million?
That's right.
It's $650 million
and change.
They're stealing
my money!
What's
our take?
I'm sorry.
What's
our take?
It's hard to say.
No, it isn't.
I made the money,
and you're stealing it!
Mr. President,
can we speak
with FBI Director
Jacobs about this?
Someone will die
for this.
He's personally involved
in this investigation.
He and his team
are busy at the moment.
No, no. This avenue
has to be avoided.
They'll be coming
from the airport
up Avenido Aeropuerto
EI Dorado
all the way
to Gran America.
Santa Fe's our spot.
As much as I'd
love to be here,
I'm taking care
of some business
in Washington,
tying up
some loose ends.
Hello. Don't hang up!
Hello.
The machine
is still on, Moira.
Hi.
Good to see you.
Agent Murray,
Ambassador Ferris.
How are you?
Ambassador.
This'll bring you
up to date.
All right.
Let's go.
So how's the food?
It's like
Mexican food.
- You'll hate it.
- I hate Mexican food.
- Hi.
- Hello.
The only thing
my secretary knows
about America
is what she reads
in travel brochures
and People Magazine.
How's the place?
Come inside
and find out.
It's, uh...
awful.
Ha ha!
Isn't it?
Mmm.
Oh.
Oh.
Mmm.
Oh.
So I take it
you shouldn't
drink the water.
They put water
in your room,
but I'd stick
with bottled stuff.
So what do you
brush your teeth with?
Use the bottled
water,
or you'll be
in the can
all the time.
The holdup was
a government connection?
That's the connection,
no doubt.
Hey! What the hell?
Oh, my God!
Back up!
Back up!
Step on it!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Watch out!
Damn it! Back up!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Take it easy.
Keep moving!
Go, Jack!
Go!
Incoming!
Dan!
Dan.
Dan.
Dan!
We can't stay here!
The car,
is it running?
It's running!
The smoke will
keep us covered.
It's our only
chance.
Got him.
Break for
the driver's side.
Ready? Go!
Get in!
Go! Go!
Housekeeping.
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.
You have a call
for Dr. Ryan.
Just a moment,
Doctor.
...in the streets
of Bogota today.
and eight wounded.
Five of the dead
are Security Personnel.
Cathy.
Don't tell me you're
in this thing.
I'm right
in the middle of it.
Honey,
Dan was killed...
Dan Murray.
I was 10 feet away.
There was nothing
I could do.
I'm coming home.
Thank God.
I love you.
I thought
his going down there
was a secret.
It was.
I don't get it.
What happened?
Nobody knows.
How stupid
are these people?
They believe
they can do anything.
You know what?
They're wrong.
Yes, sir.
They're wrong.
They've directly
challenged
the sovereign
power
of the United
States.
No more
sending messages.
He wants them
to get the message
whether the phone
rings or not.
Those are his words?
Do they sound
like his words?
He can't be clear
when clarity
is exactly what
he wants to avoid.
What he means is
the gloves come off.
Yeah.
I'm telling you,
I had nothing
to do with it.
I didn't.
I wish I had.
They deserve it.
But it wasn't me.
Who did, then?
You know...
you have no answers.
Is this the way
it was with Castro?
No answers?
You don't want
to hear an answer.
Yes, I do.
It was done to look
like you did it
by one
of the others,
as you suspected.
It's always a friend
who hates you most.
Give me the phone.
Rojas.
Did you do this thing?
Did I do
this thing?
You're calling
to ask
if I did this thing?
You don't
consult with us.
and now you have
the arrogance
to want me to believe
it wasn't you?
It wasn't, Enrique.
You've invited
the Americans
to retaliate
against all of us.
I swear.
I had nothing
to do with it.
Why do you expect me
to listen when you're lying?
Goodbye, Ernesto.
No, no, no!
Don't hang up.
We must have a meeting
as soon as possible
to straighten this out.
Tomorrow night.
No, I'm not
telling you.
I am asking you!
May we please have
a meeting tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow afternoon.
- Thank you.
He's scared.
He should be.
I don't know
what you said,
but it was right.
Strange,
don't you think?
Jacobs
and his secretary
getting killed
on the same day.
He wasn't
a secretary.
He was an assistant,
a member
of the Security Detail.
Who?
I don't remember
his name.
I'm talking
about Moira.
What?
Moira. You remember.
Jacobs' secretary.
I know Moira, honey.
What are you
talking about?
She said he was
a Latin Jack Ryan.
That's what
she called him.
I know.
The point is,
he's Latin,
which, in my mind,
connects her death
and Jacobs'
beyond their working
together.
You saw somebody
you think
is responsible
for both killings?
She did.
She did.
I saw him
from a distance...
from behind.
Medium height,
medium build,
et cetera?
Mind if I look?
Is that what the people
from the cabin said?
Yeah.
Did you check out
these calls
to Venezuela?
Disconnected.
O.K.
You have
no leads, huh?
I have
a lot of leads.
I have
a fictitious name
on a register,
a stolen, phoned-in
credit card number,
two eyewitnesses,
one who saw a guy
but really didn't see him.
Could you
play that again?
Yes, sir.
The machine
is still on, Moira.
You have a recording
of the killer's voice...
maybe.
Jack, I think
we got something here.
This is from
the answering machine,
and this was recorded
yesterday.
I'll play it for you.
O.K.
The machine
is still on, Moira.
All right.
And...
He's scared.
I don't know what you said,
but it was right.
Herb, run a match
on that for me.
He's Cuban...
educated in
the United States...
Eastern
United States.
You're sure?
Yeah.
How sure?
I need a name.
You're
talking about
hundreds of thousands
of voices.
Yeah, I know.
Target is set.
Hector!
Enrique!
Good
to see you!
It was not easy.
Enrique,
how are you?
Rojas...
Diaz.
Oh, what the hell
is this?
What the hell
is this?
Ha ha ha!
My new toy.
You like it?
You see this?
That's
your new target,
Variable,
this is Easy Rhino.
Do you copy? Over.
Loud and clear,
Easy Rhino.
Do we have a gig?
Over.
That's a rog.
Target is lit.
Start the music.
Into attack.
Pickle is hot.
Target is acquired
and lit.
Coming down.
Vega...
Iooks like
a full house.
Damn it!
Why doesn't he
fix this road?
Shit.
I thought
we had everybody.
Keep the target
painted.
Sir.
Boom!
Mother of God.
Circular error
probability zero.
Impact with high-order
detonation.
Have a nice day.
The man is completely
out of control.
The man is completely
out of control.
Completely out of control.
His name is Cortez.
Felix Cortez.
He was a colonel
in Cuba's lntelligence Service
until a few years ago.
in Puerto Rico.
Disappeared again.
to a Cali cartel subject.
I'll fax you
what I have.
I can't do that.
Not you. The police.
The Colombians.
The Colombian police,
Jack,
do not pick up
members of the cartel
unless they've got
a death wish.
Wait a minute.
Oh, Jesus.
Jack, something's
happened here.
At least 30 people
were killed,
including
women and children.
Police report
the bomb exploded
in a car belonging
to one of Rojas' associates.
Jack! Jack!
Yeah.
Did this just happen?
Just now.
...counsel of the Cali
cocaine cartel
and a businessman.
Send me
all the stuff.
We'll put a tail on him
if we spot him.
If he's still alive.
I got to go.
...the latest in a series
of mysterious explosions.
The cops
claim the violence...
You said it would be
a surgical strike.
It was.
It was perfect.
"Hurt them."
That's what you said.
I know what I said, Bobby.
Are you changing
your mind?
No, I'm not.
I hadn't counted on
this kind of
collateral damage,
and neither did he.
It'll be interpreted
like I said it would--
rivalry ended
in the blast
of a car-bomb.
Good night.
...indicates that
the guerrilla offensive
against the cartels
by antidrug units
of the Colombian...
You finish the report?
Hot off the press.
Thanks.
Any chances any of these
bombing victims' names
are aliases?
No. All l.D.s
have been confirmed.
Who are you
hoping for?
He's not here.
Cortez.
He's not here.
Um...
why was Operations
copied on this?
Ritter requested it.
Ritter, huh?
You look
very nice today.
Thank you.
Car-bomb.
What happens when
a car-bomb goes off?
It explodes.
Right. It blows up
and out.
And a missile?
Mm-hmm.
This deeper crater?
That's characteristic.
O.K. Bring up
the satellite photo now.
HMX...
and TNT.
When you
mix it 70/30,
you get the compound
called octol.
Put enough explosives
in a car,
you'll get
a big crater.
Would the car
still be there?
There would be pieces
all around here.
And where is
octol made?
Lots of places--
Europe, the U.S.
but nobody uses it.
Nobody can afford it
except the military.
An aerial bomb
would do that,
but that's not
an aerial bomb.
It's not?
No.
There is also a cellulose
residue on everything.
There should
be shrapnel here,
but there isn't.
No bomb fragments.
"Cellulose encased
laser-guided bomb."
Paper.
The Americans are here?
Ohh...
We have something in common.
Neither of us
can implement policy
from our employer.
We have something else
in common.
We both know there are
American troops in Colombia
fighting an illegal war.
I will be staying
at the Hotel Paloma de Oro
in Panama City
on Wednesday.
I suggest we meet.
Over.
The stuff's here,
and there's a lot of it.
I'm also looking
at 100 to 150 men, armed,
waiting around
for something.
Over.
Colombian Army?
Over.
Negative. They look
like mercenaries.
Over.
All right.
Get on back here.
Abort mission.
Abort mission.
Out.
Raise your arms,
please.
Thank you for responding
to my note.
You should know
that I had nothing to do
with Mr. Jacobs' death.
It was an act
of madness,
but a typical one
from the men I work for.
What do you want?
Same as you.
Mineral water.
Can we agree that as long
as Americans demand drugs,
someone
will supply them?
Look. I don't want
to be here long.
You mentioned
a gang war.
What does that mean?
That you and I
want the same thing.
The same thing.
Really?
Though you've
done all the work.
You've taken care
of the little fish.
I will take care of
the one that got away.
Once Escobedo
is gone,
your country,
your people...
by restructuring
the drug trade,
by regulating it.
What will you say
if I promise you
I will reduce
the cocaine shipments
to your country
by half?
That you've
been using
too much
of your product.
Ha ha!
I can also
promise you
regular quotas
on major arrests
that your police
can take credit for.
Imagine that--
dramatic seizures,
drastic reductions,
no more
senseless violence.
You'll have
your victory.
In return for what?
Well, I also
need a victory
to establish
my position
with what's left
of the cartel
so I can help you.
I need to defeat
those soldiers
blowing up
everything they see.
Give me maps
of their locations.
Cut off
their communications.
DEA's sending the audio
surveillance tape.
I haven't got it yet.
You know what
you think about--
when you're
lying here?
You know
you're going to die,
and you think...
that's all right.
You lived
a long time.
You got a family
that loved you.
You had a job that
you thought made a difference,
that you thought
was honorable...
and then
you see this.
I'm afraid
if I dig any deeper,
no one's going to
like what I find.
You took an oath...
if you recall...
when you first came
to work for me,
and I don't mean to
the National Security Advisor
of the United States.
I mean to his boss.
And I don't mean
the President.
You gave your word...
to...his boss.
You gave your word
to the people
of the United States.
Your word
is who you are.
What else
you got there?
I brought you
some new magazines.
The situation
in East Timor
seems to have
stabilized
during the day.
Good.
Is that it?
Except for
the other thing.
We've accomplished
a lot.
We're seeing
tangible results.
Drug shipments
are down.
Price on the street
is rising.
Perception is that
the administration
is doing
something right.
What's
the bad news?
I'm concerned about
this latest incident--
the car-bomb
coming so soon
after Jacobs'
assassination.
It's the kind of thing
reporters live for.
They'd love to
make a connection.
And you think
they will.
I think it's time
the whole thing went away.
If that's
what you think.
I think so.
Then it should
go away.
It never happened.
Yes, sir.
Well, I mean,
it's possible.
It would be
a lot easier
if you told me
whose system
you wanted me
to break into.
Good morning,
Dr. Ryan.
Morning.
Well...
we're way beyond
birthdays now.
I'm going to
have to write
a special program here.
Right.
O.K., sweetheart...
Iet's get to work.
Fine. Good.
Yes!
Here we go.
Jesus.
"Reciprocity."
What's that?
I forgot
to tell you.
After
you get the code,
wait until he's off
before you log on
because he'll
know when you do.
It's too late.
Oh, my God.
Cutter.
Yeah.
Uh, Bob.
Jack Ryan here.
Good morning,
Jack.
I was just thinking.
Maybe we got off
to a bad start.
We're going to be
working together.
Maybe we should
get to know each other.
You play tennis?
Hmm?
Tennis.
Do you play tennis?
Yeah,
I play tennis.
How about we
get together sometime?
Next week maybe.
Hour before we start work
or something.
Jack...
Yeah.
Shit.
So are crimes
against the Constitution.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Come on. Come on.
Clark.
Shit!
Son of a bitch!
Yep.
You're going
to jail.
What is that?
Hmm?
What do you think
you have there?
You are
such a Boy Scout.
Look at you.
You see everything
in black and white.
No. Not black
and white, Ritter.
Right and wrong!
You see?
There you go again.
Why was I kept out?
You're neck-deep in it.
You went before Congress
and got the money.
You lied to Congress.
I never lied!
You told them no troops.
There are troops.
I didn't know that!
No. "I have
no recollection of that."
That's the term
you have to learn.
Who authorized
this?
I'm sure they'll
ask you that.
Who authorized
this?
I have no recollection,
Senator.
Ohh...
I did not
sign up for this.
This is somebody's
bullshit political agenda.
Who authorized this?
Cutter?
Cutter couldn't
tie his shoes
without permission.
If I go down,
you're going with me.
Wrong again.
I have an autographed
get-out-of-jail-free card.
"The President authorizes
"the Deputy Director CIA
Robert Ritter
"to conduct
Operation Reciprocity,
"including all support
necessary to such activity.
"This operation
is deemed important
to the national security
of the United States."
Et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera.
You don't have
one of these,
do you, Jack?
Gray!
The world
is gray, Jack!
Got any idea
how I'm going to
get out of this mess?
Absolutely none.
Yeah.
This is he.
When?
Uh-huh.
James?
Thank you.
Admiral James Greer
devoted his life
to his country
and his family,
He served his country
for more than 50 years,
enlisting in the Navy
at 17,
graduating
from the Academy,
achieving three stars
for his flag.
He lived through
tumultuous events
in his country's life.
He made them clearer
to the rest of us
with his knowledge,
his honesty,
his integrity,
and his courage.
I can't see them,
but I know they're down there,
from your position.
Keep pushing forward.
We'll trap them.
Never, though,
was he deluded into thinking
that one man
could solve the ills
of the world.
Always the soldier
on battlefields
of the South Pacific,
Korea, Vietnam,
and Washington,
he fought
as part of a unit
to preserve the ideals...
Knife, this is
Variable. Over.
...of his nation.
Knife, this is
Variable. Over.
...to the refuge
of the earth
we entrust
our friend's body.
To the protection
of our God in heaven
we entrust his soul.
To ourselves,
we entrust his spirit
and the principles
he lived by.
We're going
to miss you, James.
Variable,
this is Knife. Over.
Variable,
this is Knife. Over.
Variable, this is Knife.
I am not receiving.
We are under
heavy attack. Over.
Go! Go! Go!
Variable,
this is Knife. Over.
Switch.
Aah!
Variable,
this is Knife.
Where the hell
are you?
Present!
Ho!
On behalf of
a grateful nation,
our condolences.
He was a very
great patriot.
Thank you.
Hello.
Jean Fowler
for Dr. Ryan.
This is he.
O.K.
I picked it up
this morning.
Variable, this is Knife.
I am not receiving, but I said,
"We're under heavy attack!"
Variable, this is Knife!
Where the hell are you?
What do you want me
to do with this?
Make a copy, Jean.
Make 10 copies.
Get them to me
quick as you can.
Jesus.
They're going to
Ieave those guys
down there.
He's on American 915.
He'll be
in Bogota 7:50.
Yeah?
It's Ritter.
Where the fuck
you been?
We have a problem.
A problem? I can't get
through to my men!
We had to
shut down
the satellite
link.
Clark.
Had to what?
It's Ryan.
He found out
everything,
threatened to walk
up the Hill
if we didn't
shut down the operation.
O.K. O.K.
It's shut down.
Just give me some air,
and my men are out of there.
Clark, maybe
you're not hearing me.
There is no air.
There is nothing.
We are shut down.
I'm on a plane.
I'm going to kill him.
Ritter?
Don't get on a plane.
He's coming to you,
arriving on American
Airlines, 1950 hours,
with no security.
Who is this?
National Security
Adviser
James Cutter,
Mr. Clark.
Once Ryan's gone,
we're back on-line.
You understand?
Yes, sir.
Clark.
Hey. Jesus.
Get in the van.
I came to find you.
You found me. Get in.
All right.
All right.
Behind the wheel!
Clark--
Drive!
Ritter.
Ryan's dead.
How?
I killed him.
Turn the Op back on.
Clark--
you said,
"Get rid of Ryan,
and we're back
in business," right?
What the hell
are you doing here?
I came to help you
get those guys out.
What can you do
to help me?
What do you need?
A helicopter.
A helicopter.
No, thank you.
What is this,
Happy Hour?
It's always
Happy Hour.
Your pilot
owns this joint?
He lives here.
Here he is.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'm here
to rent the Huey.
Sorry. We don't
rent it anymore,
but it is
for sale.
Uh, how much is it?
$2 million.
Um, my pilot and I
would have to take
a test flight.
Yes. Just leave
a deposit.
How much is that?
$2 million.
Um...
would you take
a company check?
Yes.
Here we go.
She's a big son of a bitch,
ain't she?
You have any time
in this type?
Get out of
my chopper.
No, no, no.
My chopper.
Let's go.
Their last communication
put them here.
The closest extraction
point is here,
in this gorge.
I got it.
Is that a body
down there?
Yeah.
One of ours?
One of mine.
Find a place
to set her down.
We'll look
for the others.
Nowhere to run to.
No place to hide.
Blood trails
everywhere.
They all lead
to the river.
These are the falls
we saw from the air.
All right.
They should be
about 50 meters
down.
You left us!
You left us!
Hey!
With no support
at all!
You left us!
Son of a--
Easy! Easy!
Easy, son!
Get off!
It's not his fault!
Whose fault is it?
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
I was on point
when the last
attack came,
over a mile away.
By the time
we got back,
it was over.
They were taking
Captain and Oso.
The others?
I buried them.
Road to the town.
They loaded
the prisoners here.
Blood everywhere.
God knows where
they are now.
Escobedo knows.
Are you going to
knock on his door?
Good morning.
I'd like to see
Ernesto Escobedo.
I don't have
an appointment.
Gracias.
Sure.
O.K.
Arms up.
Arms up!
He's in.
Bird, this is Variable.
Over.
Bird, this is Variable.
Over.
Dr. Ryan.
Sit down.
What can I
do for you?
Well, I didn't know
who else to turn to.
I have a problem.
An associate
of mine,
a coffee buyer
and his assistant,
were on
a business trip
in this area.
They unexpectedly
disappeared yesterday.
I'm very concerned.
Coffee buyer.
Mmm. It's very
important to me
to find them.
Coffee buying
is becoming
a very dangerous
business.
Yes.
Yes. Well, it was
for Peter Hardin.
Who?
A client
of Lindo Coffee.
Lindo Coffee
has many clients.
Well, you must have
heard of this one.
He owed your company
a great deal
of money.
Oh? Well,
I'll have to talk
to Accounting
about that.
$650 million.
And change.
Are you offering
to help me
with the collection
of an unpaid debt?
No.
What are you offering?
Felix Cortez
has sold you out.
His next move
is to murder you
and take over
the cartel.
Where is
my tape recorder?
Play the tape.
Mira! Mira! Mira!
Let's move.
I'd like you to meet
my new friend--
Dr. Ryan.
Doctor? Why?
ls somebody sick?
What does he want?
The safe return
of his associates.
And, uh, what does
he offer us in return?
You.
Whatever this man
told you is a lie.
He lies for a living.
He's in the lntelligence
business.
Exactly.
You're in the
lntelligence business!
You've taken care of
the little fish.
I will take care
of the one that got away.
Once Escobedo is gone,
I will be in a position
to help you.
The question is...
what am I supposed
to do with you?
Ugh!
Well?
Guess I'm supposed to
hit you with this bat!
I can also promise you...
Get up!
major arrests that your police
can take credit for...
dramatic seizures,
drastic reductions,
no violence
to speak of.
You'll have your victory.
ln return for what?
Where are they?
They're here.
Seal the plant!
The American killed
Ernesto!
Come on! Move!
Let's go!
Bird to Variable.
Where the hell
are you?
Well, I'm cruisin'
about 5 klicks south
of the village. Over.
Stay there. I'll get
back to you.
Roger that.
No one.
The prisoners.
Oh.
Come on, guys.
Let's go, son.
We're goin' home, boys.
Pick us up at
the Lindo Coffee Factory.
Psst!
From your point of view,
it can eliminate a potential
security problem, does it not?
Not only can I expose you
to the press,
so can the soldiers,
or do you want to take
your chances
ending the political career
of your Commander-ln-Chief?
Aah!
Let's go!
Get your asses in here!
Come on! We got to go!
Come on!
Get your butts in here!
Hold it!
We wait for Ryan!
Yeah? We're out
of here!
Set it down!
He's down there!
Come on!
I got you!
Chavez, cover me!
Your hand!
Give me your hand!
President will
see you now, sir.
Jack.
I'm glad you're here.
Sit down.
Can I get you anything?
No.
Come on. Sit down.
I would prefer
to stand, sir.
Some things have
gone on here
that I'm just
becoming aware of.
I was kept
in the dark--
as you were--
for a very long time.
Troubling things.
Yeah.
Now we have to
figure out
who is responsible
for what
and what to do
about it,
and we have to
do this delicately,
otherwise people might
get the wrong idea.
We have to lie.
Did I say that?
No, you didn't.
You're upset.
I'm upset.
Well,
it's understandable.
You mind if I give you
a bit of advice?
You know this because
you're a smart guy.
Never make important
decisions while you're upset.
You did,
and American soldiers
and innocent civilians
are dead because of it.
I never ordered any--
I will not let you
dishonor their memories
by pretending you had
nothing to do with it.
How dare you
lecture me?
How dare you, sir?
How dare you
bark at me
Iike some little
junkyard dog?
I am the President
of the United States!
It gives me no pleasure
to do it, sir.
As Acting Deputy Director
of lntelligence,
it is my duty to
report this matter
to the Senate
Oversight Committee.
You're not going
to do that.
I'm not?
No, no.
You've got yourself
a chip in the big game now.
You're going to
tuck that away
for a time
when your own ass
is on the line.
Then you're going
to pull it out,
and I'm going to
cash it in for you,
right?
I don't think I
have anything more
to say to you, sir.
The country
can't afford
another scandal,
Jack.
To protect itself,
of another deception
that goes all
the way to the top.
You'll take
the blame.
Cutter and Ritter
will take some, too,
but just a slap
on the wrist
and then $20,000
an hour
on the lecture
circuit.
The rest
of the blame
will fall on Greer.
You'll destroy
his reputation,
but that's as far
as it will go.
The old Potomac
Two-Step, Jack.
I'm sorry,
Mr. President.
I don't dance.
Ryan, have you
got a minute?
No.
We need to talk.
Ryan!
The Committee will please
come to order.
The Chair will now call
Dr. John Ryan.
Dr. Ryan,
thank you very much
for appearing before
the Committee today.
Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Please stand
and raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony
you're about to give
is the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?
I do.
You may consider yourself
under oath.
Please be seated.
