MAN: Gotta go.
MAN 1: Nice.
Hey! What happens in Vegas...
BOTH: Stays in Vegas!
MAN 1: Hey, I found mine!
Look.
I think you killed this guy.
What?
RACHAEL: Hi.
HENDERSON: Rachel, how are you?
He pinches my ass, I'll deck him.
No, you won't.
I remember. It was the threesome.
I can't wait for tomorrow
'cause I get better-looking every day.
Hi. Oh, yeah.
ED: Welcome back, Senator.
It's good to be back in Vegas, Ed.
And who might this pretty young thing be?
I'm Sam, your new casino host.
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay more enjoyable...
please don't hesitate to ask.
I'm sure I'll think of something you can do,
little lady.
ANNOUNCER: And today's
Desert Surfing Championship...
brought to you by
the Montecito Casino and NBC...
Danny, you let her go out like that?
ED: Look what the hell she's wearing.
Or not wearing.
DANNY:
Did I just say that out loud?
Listen, you better get control of her.
You hear me?
DANNY:  "Get control of her"?
Does Ed even know his daughter?
Damn, she's hot.
If I weren't working right now...
Hey!
Sorry.
ED: Our special friend is gonna be staying
with us for a few days.
DANNY: He bring his virtue police with him?
And as usual, Senator Henderson
doesn't want anyone to know that he's here.
That's because he's a hypocrite.
DANNY: He stands in front
of the camera every chance he gets...
spouting morals and virtues.
Meanwhile, he's here once a month...
indulging in every one
of the seven deadly sins.
I think he's up to number nine
on the Ten Commandments list.
As I said, he's a special friend
of the Montecito's.
And did I mention that he owes us
$3.5 million?
MAN: We have a situation at the valet.
Monitor 27.
ED: Now, what the hell is that?
DANNY: That's our new King Arthur
for the show.
I'm picking up multiple signals
on the casino floor. Main screen.
He's got audio and video devices
hidden in his pack.
ED: I think this guy's a reporter.
Get me Cameras 18 and 22.
I gotta see what he's looking at.
Eighteen through 22.
Danny, take him down right now. Right now.
DANNY: Hey. Over here.
DANNY: All right. Let's get him off the floor.
SECURITY MAN: Got him.
I guess you guys have never heard
of the First Amendment.
Let me see some I.D.
DANNY: Guy's name is Aaron Walker.
He's a reporter.
Mr. Aaron Walker.
Mr. Walker, we don't allow working reporters
in our casino.
Freedom of speech.
Well, then listen. This is private property,
and our guests have a right to their privacy.
That include public figures
like Senator Henderson?
Well, that includes all our guests.
So you're saying
Senator Henderson is a guest?
No comment?
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas?
Escort Mr. Walker out of the casino,
off the property.
I know the senator's here.
I know he plays here...
and I know he owes the casino money.
Mr. Walker, I would also suggest
that you leave Las Vegas altogether.
Is that a threat?
No, sir. That's just a suggestion.
I don't want this guy
within a mile of the senator.
Merlin!
ARDEN: Where have you been
for the past 500 years?
ARDEN: Merlin!
We knew Las Vegas was
the entertainment capital of the world.
We didn't know
there was entertainment everywhere.
Susie wanted to go to Branson,
but I told her...
that everybody who's anybody
comes to Vegas!
- I'm Stevie Benkin. I sell tyres.
- No?
Citizens of Camelot...
I present Merlin, the magician.
What is this strange new magic
you have, Merlin...
that allows you to see everything?
MARY: He's the new King Arthur
for the show. He's really quite good.
Mary, get the king out of my face.
Lancelot, my friend, my brother!
Lady Guinevere!
My love, my life.
Merlin, serenade her for me.
This guy's good.
DANNY: He's wearing real armour.
I'm worried about Greg.
Your King Arthur's wearing real armour.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Something's wrong.
Nobody's seen Greg in over a week.
He's probably in Reno
or Laughlin on a bender.
I think we should call Luis.
Luis is a cop.
Greg doesn't need any more problems.
ED: Danny.
ARDEN: Lady Guinevere...
once again, I am your champion.
SUSIE: He's really good.
I'll say.
You will return
the maiden's belongings to her...
and beg her forgiveness on your knees...
or die by my sword.
I'm sorry.
I didn't even feel him take my wallet.
We'll take it from here. Thank you.
ARDEN: Thank you, Merlin.
To the Round Table!
ED: On behalf of the Montecito Hotel,
I'd like to extend our apologies.
Apologies? We just checked in...
and this is already the best vacation
we've ever had!
Listen, I'd like to comp your entire stay here.
ED: And if there's anything I can do
for you whatsoever...
please don't hesitate to call.
Thank you. Oh, Merlin.
This beats the hell out of Branson.
Yeah.
SAM: It's Sam. We have a problem.
ED: Yeah.
ANCHORPERSON:
Sen. Bill Henderson. Welcome, Senator.
HENDERSON: Thanks. Pleasure to be here.
ANCHORPERSON: Let's jump right in.
Why the new book? Why now?
Because the liberal left,
with their sexually explicit...
and perverted TVshows and music,
are taking this country right down the toilet.
French maids are fun, Ed...
but I need some real action.
I strongly recommend you not leave
Montecito property this trip, Bill.
HENDERSON: Thanks for the concern, Ed.
But I'm sure you'll be able
to protect my privacy. You always have.
We had a reporter here.
You got rid of him, didn't you?
- Yes, I did, but...
- Then what's the problem?
There is no problem.
Sam, put him in some makeup
and get him a wig.
A good one.
What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas!
MIKE: Right. Close.
Close, but not in his backseat.
DANNY: Yeah, thank you.
MIKE: Sure you don't want me to drive?
You're not driving my car,
so just get the thought out of your mind.
You know, I can do a few things
under this hood to give this baby a boost.
DANNY: Do not go there, Mike.
MIKE: All I'm saying is...
McCoy Construction.
DANNY: It's Danny.
McCOY: Hey, buddy, how you doing?
DANNY: I'm good.
DANNY: I was wondering
if you heard anything from Greg.
McCOY: I haven't seen him
in the last few weeks.
He left me a little shorthanded, you know?
And without a night watchman.
DANNY: Did he say anything?
Did he say he was going anywhere?
No, he just said he needed to talk to you.
You did call him, right?
No, I never got ahold of him.
McCOY: Too bad, because he said
he really needed to speak to you.
McCOY: I'm sure everything's okay.
Yeah, I'm sure it is. All right. Thanks.
DANNY:  Mary's right.
Something must be wrong.
Greg would never put my father
in a bind like this despite his addiction.
He and Mary and I grew up together.
He was the kind of guy who was fun
to be around, but always got you in trouble.
And I think he might be in big trouble now.
BOTH: Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Get him back to the Montecito now.
SAM: Thank you.
Say thank you. Bye-bye.
HENDERSON: Come on.
I'm just getting started.
SAM: No, you're just getting finished.
This is how it's gonna be?
Wherever I go, you follow?
WALKER: Before you give me
the "get out of Vegas" speech, kid...
you ever wonder why Senator Henderson
only plays at the Montecito?
Senator who?
SAM: Playtime's over.
WALKER: Senator Henderson.
HENDERSON: I'm just getting...
I have no idea what you're talking about.
WALKER: Then let me enlighten you.
Senator Henderson has something
over Big Ed Deline...
and maybe he's holding it over his head.
Who headed up the Senate Intelligence
Committee while Ed was in the CIA?
WALKER: That's right.
Senator Bill Henderson.
The senator has something on Ed, kid.
That's why Ed's protecting him.
Weren't you leaving town?
Yeah, I am.
In fact, I got a room
just outside the city limits.
HENDERSON: You're killing me! Oh, yeah!
Please don't tell me
this guy called the cops on me, Luis.
What? What is it?
It's Greg.
Where'd you find him?
At the edge of a golf course.
A couple of drunk golfers stumbled on him.
- He'd been trying to get ahold of me.
- Do you have any idea why?
He probably needed money again.
I don't know.
How much did he owe this time?
DANNY: If I'd just returned his call sooner.
You should have told me he was missing.
- If I had returned his call, this wouldn't...
- Danny, don't go down that road.
DANNY:  Luis is right. We all tried
to help Greg at one time or another.
Mary, me, my dad, even Luis.
You and I both know
there's only a handful of people in town...
who loan money to gamblers.
Only two would do something like this.
Tyler O'Riley or Johnny Stones.
You stay out of this, Danny.
DANNY: He was my friend.
LUIS: Was your friend.
He stopped being everybody's friend
when he couldn't control his gambling.
LUIS: Just let the police
handle this, Danny. Danny.
DANNY:
Greg was to join the Marines with me...
but bailed at the last minute.
Went to work for my father instead.
I guess you could say
in the job I was supposed to have.
And I guess you could say that makes him
a better son to my father than I ever was.
Is it true?
Come on. Hey.
MARY: I wanna see him.
ANNOUNCER: Waves being created
at six to 10-footers by pumps...
at a rate of about 100,000 gallons
per minute.
To arms!
To arms!
Ed.
I need some time off.
If it's about your friend,
you take as much time as you need.
You heard.
Yeah. I'm sorry. But listen, Danny...
if it's about revenge,
you're not going anywhere.
- It's not.
- Listen to me. You're not a cop.
You're not in the Corps.
You gotta let the police handle it.
Just please trust me.
Eddie, the new King Arthur show
is totally sold out.
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.
JILLIAN: Hi, Danny.
DANNY: Hi, Mrs. Deline.
Tickets went on sale three hours ago,
and it's sold out.
That's good. Isn't it?
The man just ran through the middle
of a crowded casino...
in full battle array yelling, "to arms,"
with a sword in his hand.
I see why that might be a problem.
Honey, you've gotta get us tickets.
This guy is incredible.
He has an unbelievable actor's resume and...
He has also
an unbelievable mental health resume.
Apparently, you don't wanna be anywhere
near him when he's doing Richard III.
Eddie, just get us the tickets.
I can have Mary get you guys some tickets.
JILLIAN: Thank you, Danny.
We were...
We were wondering if we could get a picture
of us and King Arthur...
in front of the pyramid,
you know, to show the folks back home.
And it'd be really great if we could
get his horse in the picture, too.
- We could probably work something out.
- Thanks, Merlin, thanks.
You, too, Lancelot.
SAM: Ed.
SAM: Senator Henderson
wants to see you now.
HENDERSON: We need to talk about
this problem with the reporter, Ed.
I've taken care of it.
Someone obviously told him where I was.
No, nobody told him where you were.
Then how did he find me?
He's a reporter.
You come to this town every month,
play at the same casino...
you go to the same strip club.
You couple that with the amount of time
you spend in the media...
crusading against the sins of the world,
a blind man can find you.
Now, you and your casino assured me
of privacy.
Yes, we did.
HENDERSON: You better hope
this doesn't get out.
'Cause it'd be a shame
if anyone was to find out...
what happened with that
little covert operation of yours.
Yes, it would, Bill.
You were always good
at making things go away, Ed.
Make this reporter go away.
I've dealt with every kind of swine there is.
This guy's the biggest pig of all.
Gonna be a long weekend.
Lancelot, I fear no good will come...
of Merlin's connection
with this evil sorcerer.
You and me both.
Lady Guinevere!
So everything okay with the senator?
Yes, it's fine.
Ed, is there something you're not telling me
about Senator Henderson?
You wanted to see me?
Yes, I did. Danny got some pretty bad news
about a friend of his...
and I don't think he should be alone.
Yeah. No. Certainly. Come on.
DANNY:  What's going on here?
Ed's trying to get rid of me.
Come on.
We'll go somewhere where we can talk.
DELINDA: This wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.
Greg lived in that trailer.
He was my dad's night watchman.
And we're here because?
DANNY: Because I wanna find out
who killed him.
He actually lived here?
It was free rent.
DELINDA: I guess you, Mary, and Greg
were pretty tight?
Yeah, we were.
I should have known
he'd go to O'Riley for money.
DELINDA: Who's O'Riley?
DANNY: A punkass dirtbag.
DELINDA: Can you be more specific?
He's a last resort for money
in a town full of it.
DELINDA: You're looking for O'Riley?
DANNY: He's not too hard to find.
DANNY: Usually holds court in front of
the Monte Carlo.
DELINDA: I'm sorry about your friend...
but don't you think you should
go to the police with this?
- You don't wanna talk about this, do you?
- Not really.
- Okay. Let's talk about something else.
- Okay.
Why don't we talk about your father?
DELINDA: My father?
DANNY: Yeah.
Is there anything in his past
that might come back to hurt him?
DELINDA: You mean CIA past.
DANNY: Yeah.
Well, I could tell you, Danny,
but then I'd have to kill you.
It was a joke, Danny.
DELINDA: Danny, what's wrong?
It's Tyler O'Riley.
GUARD: Hey!
Danny!
LUIS: Danny, that's enough!
If we weren't friends,
you'd be spending time behind bars!
Knock it off! It's over, Danny. Go home!
MIKE: Next time you're in town,
make sure you come back to the Montecito...
and visit us, okay?
You have a safe trip home.
Let's get these cars out of here!
These people wanna go home.
Johnny!
A little help with the bags
over here for this beautiful young lady.
Thank you very much. That's right.
All right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
MIKE: Heard about Greg. Sorry, man.
DANNY: Thanks.
Word's all over you went to town
on O'Riley...
in the middle of the Strip last night.
It's about time
somebody took down that punkass.
DANNY: I'll see you.
If there's anything you need,
you let me know.
LUIS: You okay?
DANNY: Yeah.
Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry about last night, Luis.
I would have done the same thing.
I wanted to let you know,
we're searching O'Riley's house right now.
I don't think we're gonna find anything.
All right. Well, thank you.
- Thanks for letting me know.
- No problem.
DANNY: All right. See you.
All right, people.
Let's get these cars moving out.
MIKE: We got a busy day.
WOMAN: We've been up all night.
NESSA: Morning, Danny.
DANNY: Good morning. Hey.
DANNY: How long have you known Ed?
NESSA: Since I was a kid. Why?
What can you tell me about him?
NESSA: What do you wanna know?
- He got any secrets?
- Everybody has secrets, Danny.
Any secrets that might get him into trouble?
Probably.
- You're not gonna tell me anything, are you?
- No.
DANNY: I didn't think so.
I'm still waiting for you
to show me the sights of Vegas, Danny.
DANNY: Ed?
This isn't what you think. This is...
That screen was there when I walked in.
Why didn't you tell me
about your friend Greg's problem, Danny?
You know, I might have been able to help.
Problems like that aren't supposed to happen
to Vegas natives.
They're supposed to know better.
And I guess I thought I was protecting him.
Yeah.
ED: You know, in the early '90s...
I was in charge of this...
covert operation.
We were in somewhere
where we didn't belong.
Some bad stuff happened.
Some really bad stuff, Danny.
MAN: The reporter's back in the casino,
headed to the high-limit slots.
WALKER: Senator, smile pretty.
Senator, what do you think
about the budget cuts?
HENDERSON: What the hell?
WALKER: Senator!
DANNY: Get security to block all the exits.
ARDEN: Merlin!
Hey, find him, Danny!
In the middle of rehearsal, he just took off.
ARDEN: Release the dragon's breath!
MARY: Mr. Deline's a very busy man.
Let's just get back to rehearsal.
Arthur, he is not Merlin...
and you are not King Arthur.
MARY: You are Arden King.
You are an actor in a show.
- What evil is this?
- It's not evil. It is true.
- You must release the dragon's breath.
- Arden, listen to me.
ED:  I've your medical records.
I need you to get ahold of yourself.
Stop all these disturbances.
Keep it on the stage.
Would you do that?
Okay.
ARDEN: All hope is lost.
Ed!
You need to get that film,
and you need to get it now!
ED: Damn it.
DANNY: I lost him,
but he's still on the grounds...
and he's got no way out
without us seeing him.
DANNY: The guy's got digital equipment,
so all he needs is a computer...
to upload the video
and the photos of the senator.
He won't be able to log on.
We control all the computers.
He's at the VIP check-in counter.
All right.
Get somebody down there right now.
DANNY: Get somebody
to the VIP check-in counter now.
We lost him.
He's either in a bathroom or a guest room.
He can't be in a guest room. I'd have picked
him up in the elevator or in the hallway.
Well, he's gotta come out sometime.
We got him. He's headed towards the pool.
Ed, the finals of the surfing competition
are about to start.
We don't have access to their equipment.
He'll be able to upload everything.
ANNOUNCER: Here we go!
GIRL: Right there. Right over there.
ARDEN: Lady of the Lake,
I am not worthy of Excalibur.
HENDERSON:
Because the liberal left...
with their sexually explicit
and perverted TVshows and music...
are taking this country right down the toilet.
ANCHORPERSON: Come on,
Senator Henderson.
The TV and music industries
have always been an easy target.
And you've conveniently lumped in
the liberal left.
HENDERSON: Well, if the show fits, wear it.
ANCHORPERSON: I'm sorry, Senator,
but you do seem to...
ED: Danny.
Give him his camera and let him go.
And his film and his memory sticks, too.
DANNY: What?
ED: Give him everything.
- Ed, if this gets out...
- I know.
DANNY: If you release this video, Ed...
I just don't get it. Why did you let him go?
"I will fight no more forever."
- Chief Joseph, October 5, 1877.
- Right.
You know, there's just some secrets
that shouldn't be secrets.
MAN:  We have a problem
at the wave pool.
There are no waves,
and the finals are shut down.
MAN 1: What's going on?
WOMAN: Come on. What happened?
MAN 2: Man, come on!
MARY: Excuse me. Pardon me.
MARY: You have a mike? Thank you.
MARY: Excuse me.
Hello. Okay, if everyone could
please just calm down.
We're trying to fix the problem.
MARY: Please tell me you fixed the problem.
MAN 3: We don't know what the problem is.
Come here.
This is a multimillion-dollar
piece of machinery.
We have to fly in a crew
from L.A. Just to take a look at it.
Okay. How long is that gonna take?
Lt'll take a couple of hours
before they even get here.
That's great.
HENDERSON: I just got phone calls
from editors of two major newspapers...
asking me if I had any comment
on my slot machine play.
HENDERSON: They both claim to have
photos and video of me.
What the hell's going on, Ed?
HENDERSON: Do you know what
this will do to me? To my career?
I have a pretty good idea.
HENDERSON: I don't care
what you have to do! You stop this!
But I can't.
And more importantly, I won't.
What do you mean, you won't?
It's over.
You'll be lucky if they let you
pick up trash in the parking lot...
when I'm through with you.
HENDERSON: I will destroy you, Ed!
Well, I guess we'll just have to go down
together then, buddy?
My marker for my silence then.
Excuse me?
You tear up my $3.5 million marker...
and my losses from this weekend,
and I won't talk.
So, let's see.
- I tear up your marker...
- Deal?
Screw you.
Well, I'm taking you down with me, Ed.
All I did was a little gambling, but you...
You do what you gotta do, Bill.
Get me my car and my plane. I'm leaving.
You're leaving...
but see, this time,
you're gonna go out the front door.
That's an outrage. L...
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna call a valet...
and he's gonna put you in a real nice cab.
ED: I'm gonna take you to the airport and
put you on a real big commercial airline.
Look at this.
Damn it. You missed the last flight.
I guess you'll have to leave
first thing in the morning.
Check out is 11:00 a.m., sharp.
ANCHORPERSON: This just in.
Sen. Bill Henderson was spotted gambling...
in a Las Vegas casino.
MARY: Please, God, this can't be happening.
ARDEN: A damsel in distress.
MAN: Come on!
MARY: I can't believe this is happening.
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay.
I'll be lucky if they let me finish the day.
MAN: Check it out!
ARDEN: Excalibur, I call upon your power!
DANNY: He's not coming up.
MARY: You better get him, Danny.
Go out there.
Watch this.
ARDEN: Long live Camelot!
ANCHORPERSON 1: Sen. Bill Henderson,
the nation's self-appointed...
defender of virtues and morals,
was caught last night...
with his hand in the proverbial cookie jar.
Complaining for years
that the liberal left was taking this country...
down the toilet...
it would appear the senior senator
was actually leading the way.
ANCHORPERSON 2: There were also reports
that Wild Bill, when not at the tables...
was a regular at Girls, Girls, Girls,
a local Las Vegas strip club.
So I guess it's safe to say that he was
just getting a feel for his constituents.
Maybe we should send the senator
a copy of his...
Did you all enjoy your stay?
It was the best vacation ever.
We even pulled
an all-nighter last night. Honey?
We haven't done that since we were kids.
We even got a picture of us and King Arthur
in front of the big pyramid.
With his horse. His horse is right...
SUSIE: Isn't that Senator Henderson?
I told you everybody comes to Vegas.
So, what do you suppose the odds are
he won't talk?
ED: Who cares? I'm not the news, he is.
Thanks.
Danny, I'm so sorry about your friend.
Thank you.
If there's anything Ed and I can do,
just don't hesitate to ask.
My condolences, Danny.
Everybody, to Greg.
ALL: To Greg.
Viva Las Vegas!
ALL: Viva Las Vegas!
