Nice job, buddy.
I  couldn't have done it without you.
I know.
Man 7: Congrats. You're awesome.
Man 8: Nice job, mate!
Is this the "I feel sorry for Vincent"
phone call?
- Don't worry, Vince.
-
Well, look,
Try to think positive, okay?
- Chin up.
-
when you keep
cutting my funding.
I've got work to do
on the moose.
You know I've got work to do.
The threat detection is still in its...
- ... elemental phase.
-
-
- Send... Send them...
Enough already.
Cut.
Not add.
-
- Yeah. I'm on it.
Woman :
Okay, I need to go.
Yeah, okay. I'll talk to you in a bit, thank you.
Think it's my little boy in again, eh?
Looking surprise,
surprise.
Every time when he comes in.
- He's a bullet magnet.
- What's going on, guys?
Here's the report.
It's 22... again.
RPG,
direct to the chest.
See a lot of the internals
got damaged in the explosion.
Yeah,but the brain architecture's
still intact.
Regardless,
just write it off.
Okay um...,
let's salvage the cpu.
We could try to cut
the battery out.
It's still fully charged,
still stable.
No, not worth the effort.
Droid 22 written off.
Crush the shanty
and recycle the alloys. Yup.
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Easy, easy, easy.
Ninja: Come, come, come.
Into the lair.
- Amerika: Careful, man.
- Yo-Landi: We need to stitch his shit up.
Yo.
You think you got away!
No, I didn't think that,
Hippo.
But, you think you don't owe me
this money anymore huh?
We'll get your money.
Hippo.
Maybe I come to your secret
place in Soweto.
I take what I want.
It's cool.
One week.
Seven days!
-  Ninja: They didn't catch that
- Yo-Landi: What?
He knows
where we live.
He says we got a week
to come up with his money.
How are we gonna do that huh?
Come on, that's ridiculous.
We need one final job.
I'm talking about serious cash.
Okay?
We pay that animal.
We pocket the rest.
And we get out
while we still can. Boom.
Amerika: What are you getting on about,
a bank job?
No.
- Ninja: Cash in transit.
- Amerika: What?
- Yo-Landi: That's what?
- Ninja: A heist, Yo-Landi.
If we do a heist. The droids are gonna
come down on our asses, okay?
- They're going to hit us harder.
- It's true.
Guys, we need..
Like a remote.
- Like a switch.
- What? Excuse me?
Okay,
the robots are like machines, right?
Like a TV.
So if we had a remote
to switch it off...
- That's brilliant.
- Yo-Landi: We need to find the guy
who makes the robots
and steal his remotes.
Dexter?
Hello, Deon.
Welcome home.
Have you been a
good boy today?
Yeah? Did you clean my room?
Nice.
Are you working on your artificial
intelligence program tonight?
Yes.
Okay.
Um...
Hello again. Uh...
So it's... day 944.
I have several terabytes of compiling
and coding to do and then...
... we shall see.
All right. See you in a bit.
Look. That's the motherfucker.
Ninja: Him?
Dude, it's gonna be so easy.
We need those remotes,
my man.
We need those remotes.
Red bull!
Mm...
Ahh...
Okay.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
What if you change the...?
Oh!
- It's stable.
It's...
It's stable.
Of course, to really know,
I must test it
All right.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Whoa, whoa.
Hey.
Hey!
- Hey.
- How's it, sir?
- Where's the scout?
- What?
The scout, man,
Oh, the guys are prepping the compactor.
It goes in soon.
Oh, thank god.
Um...
- Don't destroy it yet, okay?
-
- Just wait for me, but don't destroy it, okay?
- Yup.
- Hello, ma'am.
- Mm-hm. Morning, Deon.
All right.
Let's have it.
What are you proposing now?
Ma'am, I think I've cracked it.
The world's first proper,
full artificial intelligence.
This is a computer system that
might be smarter than a human.
I could show it a piece of art,
and this thing, this being,
could judge that art.
It could decide if it liked it.
It could write music and poetry.
Okay. Stop.
Please, Deon.
Do you realize you just came
to the CEO of a publicly-traded
weapons corporation
and pitched a robot
that can write poems?
Well,
if you just let me explain--
Deon, Tetravaal is very
happy with you.
The scouts are a huge success.
Ma'am, look,
it won't cost you anything.
There's a droid downstairs that was written
off yesterday, smashed beyond repair.
All I'm asking for is that
you let me install this on it.
- Please just let me test it.
- No. No, I'm sorry, Deon.
You know how insurance works for those,
all the red tape
and the paperwork.
- Thank you for your time.
- Mm-hm.
Woman :  All new employees, please
report to human
Deon:
Shit.
Hey, bill.
Man :
Worker:
Hey. Can you give me
a hand over here?
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Thank you.
Ninja: Yep.
Showtime.
What's up, homes?
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey...!
Please!
Hey, what is it?
This is you getting hijacked,
my friend.
Welcome to Joburg.
And these are all part
of what makes the moose unique
And I think perfect for you
at the police department.
The strategic ability to be able to
neutralize the enemy's targets.
High-value targets:
Radar installations,
aircraft,
fuel storage locations.
Aircraft?
Yes, sir.
We're taking out
an enemy's aircraft?
We are talking
about urban crimes here?
You know, muggings,
carjackings, loitering.
I'm talking all kinds
of targets, sir. Low to high.
I do believe you need
a weapons platform
that can fire high explosive warheads
with precision and reliability.
And might I add, sir, all under
the control of a human operator.
Look, Miss Bradley,
The police force is very happy
with the scouts.
Very, very happy.
- We just ordered new droids.
- Thank you.
And we've been very successful
at bringing down the crime rate.
But this?
No, we don't want this.
I mean, look at it.
It's overkill.
It's expensive,
it's big, and it's ugly.
It'll have to get a hell
of a lot worse...
... for us to even consider this.
A hell of a lot worse.
No, I think we're done here.
Michelle: Well, thank you,
Commissioner Steenkamp.
We'll get you those scouts.
Ninja:
Wakey, wakey.
Please.
Please, I don't have much money.
Shut up.
I don't want your money.
- We know who you are, my friend.
- We know you make the robots.
No, there must be a mistake.
I mean...
Stop playing dumb
with us!
Yo. We know you clowns
have some kind of TV remote thing
to switch those robots off.
Excuse me?
It's a machine.
It's got an on-off switch.
- Maybe there's a remote in the Van.
-  check the Van. Amerika.
- Amerika: Cut his feet off.
- Ninja: That's a good idea.
No, no, no!
No, please! Help!
Yo, man, that's a good idea.
We'll cut your feet off.
And you can just get yourself
a nice, funky wheelchair.
No, please, please. Just listen.
You cannot switch them off.
Bullshit!
It's a machine.
They are designed with a firmware lock.
They're always on.
- Yo-Landi: Just shoot him, man.
- Deon: Please! Please, don't! No!
Amerika:
Yo!
Y'all gotta see this.
Ninja:
Jesus Christ.
He managed to turn this one off.
There's legs and shit
all over the place.
Was he gonna build it
or something?
You know what?
What if we get him to program
this bad boy to fight for us?
Like an indestructible robot gangsta.
Number one, son.
Hey.
Listen, my friend, we know
about your little buddy at...
... at the back of the van you're
trying to hide from us.
I wasn't hiding anything.
Either you reprogram that robot
in the Van to work for us,v
or we fucking
shoot you right now.
What do you mean exactly,
"reprogram him"?
- Yo-Landi: Don't play dumb!
- Dude. You know exactly what we mean.
You turn that robot into
the illest gangsta on the block.
We use him to make some moves
and make some real money.
The one in my van is a test.
It's never been tried,
but if it works, you can...
You can train him to do what you want.
I swear.
What do you mean,
"if it works"?
It's a new project
I'm working on.
It makes the robot have a mind
like a human.
But it's like a child
in the beginning.
Like a human baby,
but smarter.
It's AI is capable of learning much faster
than any organic intelligence.
- But it would have to be taught.
- Well, how long would that take?
I said I don't know!
It's untested.
Alright, enough of this.
Look! This is your only option!
I created them and I'm telling you:
You cannot switch them off
and you cannot hack the other ones.
Please,
I don't wanna die.
Okay.
It's just plug and play.
Quick release.
Snap on and snap off.
Why is all its legs off?
It was scheduled
for destruction.
- Ninja: Why?
- Because it's damaged.
The battery is fused with the shanty.
What?
It means you can't change
the battery.
Why they how long will it last?
- Shit.
- Ha-ha-ha. Oh, shit.
Approximately five days,
until the battery dies.
And you say this thing will only
run for five days?
Roughly, yes.
- Ninja: What is that?
- Deon: It's a guard key.
You need it to
install new software on the droids.
Ninja:
Come on, man.
Remember how I said it has to learn?
I have to come back
and help to teach it.
Otherwise, this is pointless.
Yo-Landi: Fine.
Just switch it on.
Switch the thing on now,
my friend.
Now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, shit.
Give it space.
Give it space.
It's okay.
Give it space.
- Please, please, please. Put the gun down.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Ninja:
Dude.
Deon:
Come on.
Amerika:
Hey.
Hey.
Come on out.
Hey, come here.
Come here, little buddy.
Come here. Come here.
Come out.
Come-- get the fuck out!
Please! It doesn't understand
English yet.
It doesn't understand you.
You gave me
a retarded robot?
You're scaring it.
Just go in the kitchen.
Ninja come, just go in the kitchen.
I've got this.
I'll get it. Just go get a beer
or something.
Deon:  Hey.
Come on.
Come...
on...
It worked...
It worked...
Yo,
computer boy.
Can he understand me
when I speak?
No.
No, not yet.
Soon.
Hey.
It's okay.
- Yo-Landi: Come.
- Deon: Come out.
-
-
-
-
See? That's it.
Come.
Come.
That's good.
That's good.
Come.
I know you don't understand,
but it's okay.
Come. Here we go.
Yo-Landi: It's okay.
It's some crazy shit, eh?
You like that?
He's so cute.
Like a baby, eh?
Robot:
^ Watch...
That's amazing.
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I'm just gonna get one more thing.
Yo-Landi: It's good.
- Hey.
- It's okay.
Deon:
Hey.
What's this?
Hey, look at this?
Look at this.
Listen.
That's a chicken.
Yo-LAN-Di.
good.
Deon.
Yo-Landi: You look so happy.
Like a little happy chappie.
That's it. That's your name.
"Chappie"...
No. No, no, no.
No, his name is not--
Yo-Landi: I like that.
Amerika: That's good.
I like that too.
Deon: Okay.
Chappie.
Chicken. Yeah.
Ninja:
What the fuck is this?
We're just orienting it.
Chappie:
Chicken.
- Come here!
- No, no, no.
- Wait! Wait! I need to get the guard key
out of his head.
- Wait, Ninja.
I'll orient you,
if I ever see you again.
He's mine!
He's special.
I don't want any confrontation, okay?
But I want to see him tomorrow. You agreed.
Come. You made an agreement.
Just let him, just let him come train the robot.
Please just let me come and see him
like we agreed. Please.
Okay, okay.
I'm coming back.
Chappie, I'll be back!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you?
Where'd you go?
What the hell are you up to,
Deon?
What the hell is this?
Open.
"Scout 22, guard key installed."
:
Adam:
Men:
Oh, so you watch cartoons?
Huh?
No, no, no,
my friend.
You stay under this roof,
you make money for me.
The first thing you do is you get your gun.
Take it out.
Then you cock your gun.
Now it's ready to shoot,
Okay, now you choose your target.
Now you see, I think I want to shoot that blue bottle,
there in the front.
Come have a look. Nice and easy.
So I aim at the blue bottle,
like, there it is.
I'm like, "okay, and--"
Now I'm going to shoot  the green bottle.
Okay, look, I aim and pow!
See?
Now I'm gonna shoot
the yellow one.
See, it's easy.
Just aim the gun, and--
Come here.
Come, come, come. Just...
Come here. Come here.
Stand here. Now, listen, take the gun.
Hold the gun properly...
just straighten your arm.
Just hold the fucking
gun properly, Chappie.
Oh. Jesus Christ.
Okay.
One, two, three.
Oh.
Jesus, my bag.
Don't drop my gun, Chappie!
And you fucked up my sight.
This shit's expensive.
- What are you doing?
- Teaching him to shoot.
You shouldn't be doing this shit
with him yet.
Deon said he has to be
orientated first.
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna
go and get the weed on my own.
Without the stupid
fucking robot.
And I'm gonna make
all the money
So we can buy the explosives
to do this heist.
Or else we're fucking dead.
He's not stupid.
He's just a kid.
Ninja: Go do your nails and play hide and seek
with your titanium baby!
You having a baby, man?
- Huh?
-  Uh...
Still a baby yourself,
aren't you?
Whoa, hey. Whoa.
What happened, man?
Jeez. You got a little bit rowdy
at the bar with your mates, did you?
Hey, listen. If you ever wanna come out
with me, you know...
go hit the heavy bag at the gym,
More than welcome. We could nut out
a few great moves.
- I'll show you how to scrap. Yeah.
- Uh.
Always gotta be ready.
You know what I'm saying?
- Want in?
- Thanks for the offer, but I'm good.
I'm good, yeah.
Just got to...
No worries.
Well, anytime.
It's real cool, man.
It's really cool.
Hey, listen, bit of a favor.
Little thing.
Um... Just wanted to borrow
the uh... guard key
So I can check scout security
levels with my design. You know.
I just wanna make sure I got the
moose as secure as the scouts.
- Borrow it?
- Yeah.
Now, Michelle asked me
to check on the security, so...
-Yeah, just an hour or something.
- Uh...
Vincent,
you know I can't do that, right?
There are clear rules about that.
You know how that works.
Blah-blah-blah.
Hey listen,
don't be such a wowser.
I'm just an engineer talking to another engineer,
asking for the guard key. That's it.
"Engineer"?
Weren't you a soldier?
- Look, I'm only joking. I'm... sorry.
- Vincent: That's funny. Yeah.
You'd have to tell
the board of directors--
I spent two years at DARPA,
you whacker.
And, yeah, I was SASR,
you little stickybeak.
You're making me as cross
as a frog in a sock, mate.
Your frogging little robots have drained
all my funding.
You're a big problem for me,
you get me?
So I'm gonna start asking
you slowly, you dipstick.
Give... me... the... guard... key...
No.
Just taking a piss, man.
Just taking a piss.
Come on, man, look.
Empty.
As if I'd carry
live rounds here in the office.
It's a prank. Everyone go back
to work, man. Come on.
Oh, by the way.
Church.
Any Sunday, mate, any Sunday
You're welcome. Come with me.
To all of you.
All welcome.
It's just a prank,
man.
This office
has gotta lighten up.
Where are you going, mate?
Where are you going?
Shoe.
Say "shoe."
Amerika:
It's for your foot, bro.
Wait, wait. Chappie, look.
Look. Look.
"Rat." It's okay.
Amerika:
No, he's stupid.
He don't know how to talk. We're screwed.
No, he can talk.
He's smart.
No, he can talk.
He's smart.
Oh, my god.
Look, he's copying me!
Oh, my god.
Look, he's copying me!
Chappie! Chappie,
say "shoe."
Say "rat."
Say "mommy."
Oh!
-
- Yo-Landi: Chappie.
-
- Yo-Landi: Shoe.
-
- Yo-Landi: Rat.
-
- Yo-Landi: Mommy.
- Amerika.
- Homes.
-
- Ha-ha-ha.
Amerika homes.
- Yo-Landi: This is good, Chappie.
- Amerika: Oh, shit.
That homes is a clever
little robot. Right there.
That homes is a clever
little robot. Right there.
Ho, ho, ho.
- Hey. This motherfucker talks ghetto huh.
-
All right, you the rudest
bad boy in Joburg.
streetwise professor in Joburg,
fuck mother!
-Amerika: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
It will work, man!
- Yo-Landi: He's so smart!
- Amerika: I can work with this. This is cool.
All right,
let's pound it out.
Like this.
Go bloop!
Boom, Chappie go .
Boom!
-
- Ooh... shit...
You hear that? Somebody's here.
-
- I don't know.
Hello?
It's the nerd.
What?
No.
Deon:
Hello.
You shouldn't be here.
You need to go.
I'm here to see my--
No. He's coming back soon.
You're lucky to be alive.
I'm just gonna say hello, if--
Yo-Landi: What is that stuff?
It's umm... I'm here to teach him.
Like we agreed. Yeah.
You're gonna catch a bullet
hanging around here, nerd.
Hello, my little one.
Hello.
Have we learned this word yet?
Where did you learn that?
- These guys?
- Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you watch your mouth.
Before you get yourself shanked bitch.
- Okay. I'm sorry.
No! Chappie, please, have respect for me.
I'm your maker.
Please. If I could just have
a moment with him.
Excuse me?
Deon: You know, surely you can go and
count your narcotics in another room.
- Amerika: You know what.
- Deon: Yup.
You don't come in here,don't tell me where to go
Hun, or where to do my work?
- Listen. I don't mean to impose.
- Shut your mouth.
Amerika: I'm going to cut your tongue out.
- Deon: Yeah. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry okay. I took it too far.
- Yo-Landi - Hey, Amerika, Amerika, Amerika.
Maybe you shouldn't count drugs
in front of the kid.
I gotta get this shit done.
By the time I finish counting this,
you'd better be gone.
Deon:
Okay. Absolutely.
Chappie.
Listen to me,
I'm your maker.
I brought you into this world,
okay?
This is serious.
You mustn't engage in these people's
lifestyle choices.
- Yo-Landi: What?
- Deon: No offense, okay?
No... counting narcotics,
no robberies. no crimes.
Okay.
And you've gotta promise me.
It's that you promise me, your maker.
That you'll never do any of those things, all right?
You can't break a promise,
Chappie.
-
- Good! Yes! Yes.
Hey! Hey, stop lecturing him.
I mean, come on.
You said you're going to teach him stuff.
Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay. Come.
Chappie, sit here. Come on.
I brought you some wonderful things
to help you nurture your mind.
and develop your special abilities.
It's important to use your mind,
okay.
Here we go.
- That's a book.
It has stories, you see?
Look.
Chappie wants it.
See.
That's about a black sheep.
-
- Yeah, it's yours.
-
- Oh, wow.
Come, Chappie.
I'll show you this.
See, this is a easel.
These are your paints.
Look at this.
See that?
- Yeah, like the sky.
Listen, Chappie, in life,
lots of people will try
to tell you what you can't do.
You know what.
You must never listen.
If you wanna paint, you can.
Anything you want to do in your life. You can do.
Chappie wants to paint.
Don't let people take away your potential.
Chappie.
I'm not stopping him painting.
Go.
Paint, Chappie.
Deon:
Paint your colors on here,
like this. See?
Deon: Let's have fun.
Deon: Yeah.
Chappie: Give.
Give it to Chappie. Give.
What's the word?
Please.
May I have the paintings, Deon?
What in the name of the lord?
Deon:
That's it. Put your paint
in there. Put it on the board.
Vincent:
There's the guard key.
-
- Deon: Yeah!
Yo-Landi: Chappie,
I'm so proud of you!
Deon:
Good boy!
You just made a big mistake,
my friend.
Looks nice,
doesn't it?
There you go.
Go on. Wow.
Okay. Go on.
don't be shy.
- You painted that car.
- Wow.
- Yo-Landi: Well done!
-  Deon: That's amazing.
-
Yo-Landi: That's good, Chappie!
Chappie:
Paint more?
Deon:
Chappie.
- Ninja: Are you serious?
- Yo-landi: We were just teaching him..
- Yo-landi: We were just teaching him..
ninja:
I need a killing machine!
- He's not here to paint!
- Ninja! Just leave him!
Stop it! Stop it!
- Deon: We were just teaching him.
- Ninja: No, I don't fucking care.
- Deon: You sure.
- Deon:You sure. Sorry... sorry.
- Yo-landi: No!
Ninja:
What are you doing?
He was just teaching him
to paint!
He was just teaching Chappie!
Yeah, to be a
He's mine!
I'll call the police on you, I swear.
For mistreating him!
And tell them what?
You stole a fucking police robot!
You're a filthy person.
You're a terrible,
shitty person. Oh!
What the fuck is wrong with you.
He needs to be taught.
He's just a kid.
He's already smarter than you'll ever be,
you philistine!
Chappie, don't let this
barbarian ruin your creativity!
Nurture your creativity,
Chappie.
Maybe he's more than just a
stupid robot who shoots people.
Just let him do his stuff.
He is a kid.
don't you understand?
Yo-landi, we said
we're doing this heist.
Because it's the only way
to get us out of shit
before hippo can fucking kills us!
Ninja: I mean.
What part of "dead"
don't you understand?
The only way we can pull off this heist
is when Chappie helps us.
-Amerika: What's up, man?
- Ninja: Am I right?
- Amerika: When? Hold on. Hold on.
- Ninja: Yo-landi, am I right?
- Yo-Landi: Yes.
- Amerika: Hey, yo-yo-yo. It's Raymond.
- Ninja: Oh, yeah.
- Amerika: He says there's a cash-move day after tomorrow.
How much?
Six hundred million.
Heading south on the N1, 7AM.
Okay, south, N1, 7AM.
Yeah.
Okay. Let's call the king.
We're gonna need
a shaped charge.
Tell him we can do the usual.
And get the Van.
- Amerika: The Van?
- Ninja: Now. Yeah.
Yo-landi.
I'm gonna get us out of this.
I promise.
Hey, what cha you doing there,
little guy?
Oh, that's nice.
- Chappie, you see the house?
-
Ninja:
Yeah. To help you understand
how nice it is
to live here with mommy and daddy.
You know I'm going to take you
to go see the real world
To show you how not nice it is.
Okay, you know what?
I got a fun idea.
Chappie, you like cars, eh?
- Ninja: So why don't we go for a drive
in a real car
to see the real world.
I want to come in real car.
Chappie wants to come with.
So, come, let's do it, Chappie.
Let's go for a ride.
Come on. Leave that.
Leave that.
Come.
Say bye to mommy.
- Ninja: There you go, Chappie. Jump into the seat.
- There you go. Sit there. You see, huh?
- It's cool and turn it on.
You're sitting nice. Chappie.
Who's a good boy, Chappie?
Amerika:
You like the real world, huh?
Chappie:
-
- Amerika: It's a thing in a computer. Chappie.
Lets you look up shit
you don't know.
Hey, yo.
How's he gonna find
his way back, huh?
He's a big smart robot.
Aren't you, Chappie?
Chappie is smart.
Chappie has GPS.
Amerika:
You sure about this?
When you get back in,
start paying rent, alright?
- Hey, Chappie, come on. Jump out.
-
Come, Chappie. Come.
Come, come, come...
It's a cop!
Hey, I'm going to go.
Huh?
Welcome to the real world. Huh.
Man 1: Guys, watch it, watch out.
Man 2: Hey man!
- Check him out, check him out.
Man 2:
It's all fucked up.
Amerika: We gotta toughen you up
so you can do the heist.
- Amerika: Sorry.
Please! Please can I go
in the car?
Amerika?
Please, no!
It's a hell of a first day
of school, eh?
Chappie:
Please come back!
Man 2:
"Please, no"?
What the hell?
Man 3:
Don't get too close.
Man 1: What is that?
Man 4: Watch it, man.
Don't trust these fuckers man.
- Man 1: He's a pig!
Please...
Please, may you not...
This is not a cop, man!
He's scared!
Check this out.
"Why you do this?"
It sounds funny.
Man 2:
Chappie!
Chappie:

Man 3:
Run, bitch, run!
I want to go home!
I want to go home!
Dexter:
Hello, Deon. Welcome home.
Deon: Hello?
Man:
I'm calling from
Yeah.
It's come to our attention that you
signed out the guard key
Yeah, yeah. No, no. Sorry, it was a mistake.
I took it home with me.
-
- Thanks.
All right, got him.
Target is on the move,
eastbound. Take the next exit.
Vincent: Okay.
Approach slowly.
Stop at a safe distance.
Yo boys. The target appears
to be a police droid.
but I can assure you it is not.
Now, don't be intimidated.
He's as smart as a dunny rat,
so full aggression, okay?
- MercsG: Copy that.
- MercsB: Copy that.
Oi!
Forget your paintbrush,
did you, mate?
Hey? Well, you're just
a little Joey, aren't you?
You look scared.
Where're you going, mate?
Where're you going.
Vincent:
Vincent: This way, this way, this way.
We need access to his brain.
-
- MersG: Hey! Damn you!
Please, may you not!
Please, may you not!
I'm not your friend!
You understand.
No! Chappie has fears!
Chappie has fears!
Please, may you stop!
Please!
Vincent:
You're gonna be a good boy now,
aren't you?
Roll him over.
That's it.
Give me the screwdriver.
See, your simple AI program
makes you think you're real.
But you know what's in here,
huh?
Nothing.
Just a bunch of wires, mate.
You're not the full quid,
are you?
There we go.
There we go.
All right.
Let's get rid of him.
Come on.
Hold him down.
Hold him down.
- Hold him down!
I said hold him down!
Chappie doesn't want fears!
Chappie doesn't want fears!
MercG: Aw!
Get up!
Get up!
Stop the fucking truck!
Stop the truck!
Vincent:
Cease fire. Cease fire!
Let the cripple go.
I've got what I need.
Man:
Run, Forrest!
- Amerika: Let's do this. It's gonna be so easy.
- Ninja: Oh, Jesus.
Chappie?
- Ninja: Chappie.
- Amerika: I told you it was a bad idea.
Chappie:
Mommy.
- Yo-Landi: Chappie! Chappie, what happened?
Oh, my god. Chappie?
Chappie, what happened?
Who did this?
Oh, my god, Chappie.
Sit here. Sit here.
I'm so sorry.
Oh.
What happened?
How could you do this?
How...?
He's just a child!
I didn't know
this would happen.
I don't even know
what happened.
I hate you!
- Yo-Landi: Amerika.
Don't we have those arms, those
legs, that shit in the back?
- Amerika: Yeah, hold on.
- Yo-Landi: Do you think you can fix?
Oh, Chappie.
Chappie, let me just...
let me get some of this dirt off you.
Okay.
Chappie, who did this?
A man.
In a van.
- Yo-Landi: A man in a van?
- Yo-Landi: Did he put you in the Van?
Do you know this man?
- Amerika: That's bad,
-
And they threw fire,
even though I said please.
- Yo-Landi: Children?
Oh, shame!
Let me just...
- Yo-Landi: This thing in his head.
- Amerika: That's pretty messed up.
We need to get this...
this thing back in here.
-
- Yo-Landi:
- Yo-Landi: I'm going to fix it.
Are you gonna fix me?
I'm gonna try, buddy.
- Amerika: So how does this go?
- Yo-Landi: Here we go.
- Amerika: Where does that go?
- Yo-Landi: That's better.
All right.
Here we go, buddy.
Plug and play,
just like he said.
How does that?
I think that's it.
Can you move it?
Try it.
Try.
Try and move your arm.
Oh. There we go.
It's working.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Amerika: All right, buddy.
- Yo-Landi: Oh, Jesus. Thank god.
You're indestructible, homes.
Titanium. Indestructible.
That's you.
Is that... That's my book?
That's black sheep?
- Yo-Landi: What?
It's call
- Yo-Landi: Ja.
, I can read it for you...
- Yo-Landi: ... Chappie.
- Amerika: That's it, buddy.
"All the sheep in Magooville
were white.
But Abel was a black sheep."
Do you know
what's a black sheep?
It's, like, when you're
different to everyone else.
Like me. I look different,
from you and Amerika.
- Yo-Landi: Yeah.
Yeah, but it's not so much
how you look.
It's special like...
like what's inside.
That's what makes you different.
See,
it's who you really are.
Inside.
Your soul.
- Yo-Landi: Yeah.
You see,
the outside.
This...
This is just temporary.
When you die, the soul inside
goes to the next place.
The thing inside,
see, that's what mommy loves.
Come.
Mommy loves you.
Okay.
Come.
Let's read your book.
"Abel would help his mommy
do the housework on weekends.
"He would do all the dishes
and the laundry.
Abel was a happy sheep,
but one day..."
Hello, Chappie.
Hello, mommy.
You're a black sheep, Chappie.
You're special.
Hi, Chappie.
Chappie.
Sometimes,
people make mistakes.
I'm really, really,
really sorry, Chappie.
Do you forgive me?
Come here.
Come, Chappie.
Let's you and me reset.
- Ninja: Yeah.
- Ninja: Yeah.
And we're gonna make you nice
and tough and strong like a...,
... like a fucking robot gangsta,
number one,
- Boom. Ha, ha.
And Chappie. From now on, I'm gonna be
your daddy. For real.
You gonna be
Chappie's daddy?
- What's? What's that?
What's that, Chappie?
Show me.
Chappie. If you wanna be in the gang,
you have to be cool like daddy!
Put the thing down!
Now!
If you wanna be cool,
you have to act cool.
Look how daddy walks.
Look how cool he is.
- Ninja: You need to keep it gangsta.
-  be cool.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Amerika: Oh, its cool.
Even when you pull a gun,
you have to be cool like this. Boom!
Now, you try.
Die, fuck mother!
Boom!
Yes, Chappie! That's what you do
when you shoot motherfuckers.
No,
I can't shoot peoples.
What?
I can't shoot them.
They didn't do anything to me.
but what happens
if he pulls a gun on you?
Titanium. I'm invincible.
Amerika says.
Yeah, even if you are invincible , but you can't let
a motherfucker
disrespect you, homes.
How you gonna do the heist with us,
if you don't shoot people?
I can't do a heist. A heist is
a crimes. I promised my maker--
Chappie you were doing so fucking well.
Why do you have to fuck it up back to that little pest?
No, no, no...
It's okay, it's okay. it's okay.
- Amerika: Yeah, yeah.
It's okay. Hey. Let's worry
about that later, okay?
I got this,
all right?
You.
You're doing well.
If somebody
really disrespects you,
you can deal with them
without using a gun.
Just stick the knife in.
And they can relax and go to sleep.
you can just make them
go sleepy-weepy.
It's like a nice thing.
It feels nice, Chappie.
- Amerika: Take the knife.
- Whoa...!
- Amerika: No, no, no...
- Ninja:  No, no, no... Chappie.
Daddy's not tired.
He's already slept.
- Ninja: Real gangsters...
... use this.
- Whoa! Nice!
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Wow-wow-wow!
Whoa.
- Do it again! Yeah!
- Whoa.
Oh, shit!
Boom! Nice!
Nice, Chappie.
Nice.
You look nice now, Chappie.
Let's see you.
I've got blings?
I've got blings?
Whoa. Gangsta.
Okay. We're gonna do some stuff
to get ready for the heist.
No, no, no.
Not crimes.
- Ninja: Like, special gang stuff.
- Ninja: Yeah. You want to come with?
- Ninja: Okay, Chappie.
Your job now is to get one
of daddy's cars back
So we can get the money.
I told you, from the naughty man
who took daddy's car from me.
So now what you're gonna do is,
take the gun and you point it at him.
But dont' worry,
you don't have to shoot him.
You just have to give him a big fright
so he never takes daddy's car again!
- Give him a nice big fright so
he never takes daddy's car again!
That's good, Chappie.
Okay.
I'm gonna show you now.
He's a fucking cock. Asshole.
Hey. Hey,
There's the dick right there.
- Ninja: Go get him Chappie!
- Amerika: You go get him! Bring it home, man!
Chappie:
Hey! Cock!
What seems to be the problem,
officer?
No, don't!
What did I do?
Don't hurt me!
- Amerika: Oh! Jesus!
- Ninja: What are you doing?
Whose car?
Aww..!
- Ninja: Jesus Christ!
- Amerika: Fuck!
- Ninja: Come here, Chappie! Come here!
Amerika: Leave the car.
Amerika: Come on!
- Get in, you fool.
What's the matter with you man?
Shut the door.
Jesus Christ, Chappie.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Daddy needs the cars nice and fresh
so he can sell them.
Why smash the car,
man?
Okay, I see. I see!
Please, may I go again?
Ninja: Chappie.
Yeah. That's her.
That's the slut that took
daddy's car.
Woman: Hi, officer.
Slut! Get out.
Out!
Why you steal daddy's cars?
You naughty!
Woman: It's my car!
Ha-ha-ha.
- Man: I haven't been drinking!
Are you stealing daddy's cars
to support your alcohol?
Man:
That's my car!
- Woah, oh. Whoa... !
Ninja: That's my boy!
Yo, check this shit out!
Yeah, you're a pimp!
Yeah. I'm a pimp!
I'm a pimp!
Now we're gonna take the cars
to the king.
- Ninja: And the king's gonna give us special tools,
so we can do the heist!
And then we gonna get even bigger
monies, Chappie.
Daddy, look.
There's dogs here.
Ninja: Chappie.
They're here to fight.
Man:
Bring me the ear!
There's the police!
Run! It's a cop!
Ninja:
Hey, he's good!
He's not a cop!
Is this where the king lives,
daddy?
Yeah, you wanna come see
the king of the castle with us?
Well, you can't, Chappie.
Because you're not doing
the heist with us.
You stay here.
Maybe next time, Chappie.
Okay. I'll just chill here,
guys.
Hey, king!
- King: My brother.
- My man.
What up?
What up, man?
We got all the stuff.
- Uh-huh.
- Parked out back.
King :
We have the cars? From ninja?
Man :
Here's your explosives.
Come. Hook us up with some more shit.
Uh yeah... ... Th...
We'll take those,
Take them down to my car, .
It's dead, Chappie.
it's gone to
the next place, daddy.
Out here in the wild,
life is hard.
You see that dog there.
You're either that dog,
or you're this dog.
If you wanna survive,
Chappie,
then Chappie you must fight.
I'm titanium.
I'm gonna live forever, daddy.
What does that say there?
Battery, power,
energy supply.
Chappie, that battery's stuck.
It's melded together.
That battery can't come out.
What you gonna do
when that battery runs out huh?
I die?
Chappie die?
Deon, he puts you
in a broken body.
Deon's my maker.
It doesn't make any sense.
He wouldn't make me just so
I could die. Deon loves me, daddy.
Come here.
Come here.
I can get you a new body Chappie,
but it takes lots of monies.
The type of monies that you get
from doing the heist.
- Ninja: You have to do the heist.
Now, which dog do you wanna be,
Chappie? Huh?
That dog...
Or that dog?
Ah. That's my good boy,
Chappie.
That's a good boy.
Aye.
Oh, my god.
Again?
I'm here to collect
my creation,please.
He's too important
to leave here.
He's not here.
What? Where is he?
I don't know.
He went out with ninja.
They've been gone all day.
Doing what?
Probably committing an assortment
of felonies I would imagine.
He's probably a wanted criminal
by this stage.
Hey, Chappie!
I brought you a friend
for your chicken. Look at this.
Hey, chaps,
what are you doing?
Hey?
Chappie,
why won't you talk to me?
I'm your maker.
Come on.
What do you want,
Deon?
I don't want
that bloody chicken.
Oh, really?
What are you interested
in then, Chappie?
Hm?
Selling narcotics?
Being a deadbeat?
Deon.
Why are you trying
to control him like this?
Just let him be.
Daddy told me about you,
Deon,
about how you made me
in a body that will die.
What do you mean,
Chappie?
Is it true that I will die
in a few days, Deon?
Yeah.
Why'd you just make me
so I could die?
I didn't--
I didn't make you
so you could die, Chappie.
I wanna stay here
with mommy.
You've become so much more
than I could ever have imagined.
How was I supposed to know
that you would become...
... You?
Come on, come on.
There we go.
Alternate file: Genesis.
Yes!
Say goodbye to your daggy,
little monsters, Deon.
- Chappie? Chappie!
- Yo-Landi: Aah!
- Yo-Landi: No...!
- Chappie...!
Oh, my god!
What... What's happening?
Christ.
It's his cpu.
Oh...!
- Ninja: Chappie?
- Deon: Don't touch him, you monster!
Fuck you, dude!
- Deon: Stand back!
- Ninja: Okay, okay, okay!
Yo, yo, chill. Okay.
Hey, boss.
Take it easy, man.
Step back.
I'm taking him
away from this place!
What do you want?
Hey, man.
You're not gonna believe this.
Serious?
No, I got it.
I got it.
Hey,
The robot cops are..
they're off the line!
This city belongs to me!
I want every-fucking-thing!
Let's go!
There it is. There it is.
Man:
Please disperse!
Please disperse--
Come on.
Yes!
Men :
Burn the dog!
Get Michelle Bradley
on the line right now!
And activate every single human
officer and reservist!
Now! Do it!
TV reporter:
"Are you sure you want to erase Genesis?"
Yes, I would.
Come on,
come on.
Chappie.
Chappie.
Chappie?
Come on,
Chappie.
Chappie.
Chappie.
man.
Deon, it's me.
Ha. Oh, my god.
You're alive.
I'm not sure.
But I have some suspicions.
Come on, Chappie. We need
to get out of here. Come on.
Now, Chappie.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where is this place?
What is this place?
It's... it's a failed version of you.
A different kind of police robot.
Come on,
let's go!
Those helmets are worn by a human
who controls that horrid thing.
It reads their mind.
Doesn't have its own brain,
that robot. Not like you.
- Deon: Yeah, it's a neurotransmitter.
Come on!
But I want to...
just...
Come on.
Chappie.
No.
It can't save you,
Chappie.
The problem is much greater
than your battery.
Because you are conscious.
You cannot be copied
because you're not data.
We don't know
what consciousness is,
so we cannot move it.
Chap..
Chappie can figure it.
I can know what it is,
and then I can move me.
You can't move it. I'm sorry.
Now we need to get out of here right now.
It's dangerous. Come on!
Deon. You said to me
I mustn't let anybody
Daddy has a man that can get me
the bodies for the monies.
What?
Excuse me?
Daddy loves me,
Deon!
Theses to get my consciousness...
out.
and then I just have to get
my consciousness
Chappie, no.
What are you doing?
Chappie, put that back.
Leave it alone.
- Put that down.     It's illegal!
Chappie.
Chappie, wait!
- Deon: No!
Chappie, wait!
Please!
Chappie!
Chappie!
Vincent:
Damn it.
Policeman: Okay, Move on in.
Check the area.
Go all the way down.
Make sure we look in every room.
All the way down.
Sweep all the way back.
Chappie!
Oh, thank god!
Chappie, are you okay?
What's that thing?
It's just a neuro helmet,
mommy.
What?
Yo-Landi:
Chappie.
What are you doing?
I'm doing experiment,
mommy.
Whats.
What's all this stuff?
What's this thing?
Hm?
I'll show you.
Sit down.
Okay.
- Yo-Landi: Okay.
Okay, mommy.
- Yo-Landi Is it gonna hurt?
- Yo-Landi:  Okay.
Okay.
Wow. Okay.
Now, what?
This helmet reads the energy
from you and me.
I just need to figure out
how to get it out.
All the information I need
to help me is on the Internet.
There's books,
all the information that human
beings have ever had, it's all here.
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Deon!
Hello.
Get to your goddamn desk
and figure out what the hell
is going on.
Deon:
Yes, ma'am.
Listen. There'll be 300
homicides in the city tonight
unless your faulty droids
get back online.
Get me? This whole company
could go under.
Good work,
people.
Little... snafu.
We're taking care of this, right?
Hey, clearly the scout model has failed.
Let me send the moose in.
- Vincent: Let me show people what it can do.
- Not now, Vincent!
- This is not the time.
- Vincent: I just think the city's tearing itself apart.
The whole thing's going tits up, alright.
We have to take control.
I said... no.
And that's the end of it.
Hello, gentlemen.
- I know, it's been a tough night.
-
Daddy's gonna get new bodies,
and I just have to get this out.
I have to get
my consciousness out.
It's time
to pump up the jam.
I know
what consciousness is.
Uh-- that's nice.
All I need is... is monies from
the heist for my new body.
That's right, motherfucker.
Come.
- Ninja: Let's go.
Ninja: Go!
These are the guys that need to sleep,
Chappie.
Guard1- Aw.
Here comes the boom!
- Amerika: Hit it, hit it, hit it!
- Ninja: Go, Chappie. Go!
- Amerika: Get the money! Get the money!
Amerika: Make him sleep,
Chappie! Make him sleep!
Guard2- Aw..!
Chappie: Good night!
Sleep!
Guard3- Aww..
- Amerika: Get in there, Chappie.
Come on, Chappie!
Do you realize what you've done?
TV reporter:
Chappie.
- Amerika: Good. There's one more. Get it, get it.
- Amerika: Good, Chappie, good.
- Ninja:  Come on, Chappie. Go, go, go...
Oh, no.
You will not get away with this.
Everyone will know!
Amerika: Let's go! Let's go!
That's three. Chappie, let's go!
Guard2: Please.
- Ninja: Chappie, what are you doing? Chappie!
- Amerika: What's the matter with you man?
Ninja, grab the bag. Let's go!
Chappie, come on!
Guard2: Please don't

Ninja: Chappie,

- Ninja: Chappie!
- Amerika: Close the door. Let's go.
Please let me live.
Ninja: Chappie... ... !
Come on! Come on, boy!
Just get in.
I thought you were gonna sleep!
Can I talk to you in private?
Could you give us a moment,
please?
Thank you.
Oh, god.
This is certainly a fuck-up.
Ma'am, listen.
This is the work of Deon.
It's the work of some filthy rogue program
that he's been writing,
and last night
he brought a droid in here,
and it was sentient.
And have you seen this?
Do you know about this?
Look. It's committing crimes,
the godless monster. Look at that.
TV reporter:
I told him no!
Okay. That's a lot worse
than just failing to work.
So let's use this situation
to make a certain
other robot shine.
This thing has gotta be
destroyed,
its got to be crushed before it does
any more damage, and Deon--
Deon's gotta be removed.
Deon, he has cost this company dearly.
And your reputation.
You do not want this
to be your legacy.
Do it.
- Vincent: Destroy that robot.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Burn it to ash.
- Vincent: Thank you.
Man:
Move it out! Clear the deck!
Move it out! Let's move!
Move, move! Now!
Woman :
Come on, get out of the way,
masapiel.
You motherfucker.
I want that robot.
Go!
Everyone out! Go!
Move! Move! Move!
Go! Go! Go!
Let's go!
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfuckers!
- Amerika: I'm going home!
I'm going home!
Daddy, can we go now
and get my new body
from your friend that
bought the fresh one?
I'm sorry, man, but,
there is no new bodies.
I'm sorry, Chappie.
I swear.
What. What do you mean,
there's no new bodies?
I needed your help
with the heist. Chappie.
Just relax, Chappie.
Just at that time you were different and, like...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
You lied to me,
daddy!
- Ninja: Chappie. Whoa, whoa.
-
- Amerika: No, Chappie! Stop, Chappie!
I'm coming to get you,
Deon.
Deon: Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on!
- Amerika: No, Chappie! Chappie, stop it!
Leave me, Amerika!
You lied to me!
- Yo-Landi: Chappie!
- Deon: Chappie, no!
- Yo-Landi: No, Chappie! No!
You were gonna let me die,
daddy!
We can find a way, Chappie.
I'm sorry, my boy.
I swear, I'm sorry.
Chappie, listen to me.
I know how you feel but there's something
of great danger headed our way now,
and it's coming to hurt you.
What?
I don't have time to explain. But
when this thing gets here,
it'll stop at nothing until
you're gone, Chappie.
What are you talking about,
dude?
I'm going anyways.
My battery's gonna finish.
No, Chappie! No!
We'll find a way, Chappie.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Get back! Back up, back up!
Yeah... !
man!
I'm here...
For my fucking money, ninja!
I don't just want
my 20 million...
He's here to kill us.
Hippo:
I want your robot.
I want everything!
Fuck this shit!
Chappie, do something!
Chappie, help us!
Oh. That just tickles, boys.
That just tickles.
Ninja:
Amerika... !
Come on, little gangster.
That's it.
That's my money!
Fire, fire, fire!
Yep.
Fly up, fly up, fly up.
Yo-Landi: No!
Stop!
- Yo-Landi: Come on!
- Ninja: My bag! My bag!
I'm gonna finish you off.
Every single
pathetic scum lot of you.
Oh!
Ninja!
Fuck!
Jesus, dude!
Get out of way!
End up in a cluster bomb.
Move out of the way!
Oh...!
This is too good.
Here we go.
Oh!
No...!
Whoa!
Bugger!
Trite!
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!
Chappie!
Yo-Landi: Let's go!
Let's go!
- Yo-Landi: Ahh!
Whoa. What's going on?
I can't see.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey,
I want that truck!
- Hey, hey! Get out! Out!
- Unh!
Run, Deon, go!
Ninja:
Chappie!
No!
Maker! Maker!
Ninja: Go, go, go...
Come on!
Backup visuals.
Infrared.
I've solved it! We'll get your
consciousness out.
- Yo-Landi!
- Ah.
Chappie:
Stop here, daddy! Stop!
Ninja: Chappie.
What are you doing?
I'm coming for you now,
mate.
Ahh... !
My helmet.
My helmet.
Ninja.
Ninja.
Ninja, get back!
Get back!
Daddy, I have to get my maker to that
other neuro helmet at the factory!
I'm gonna draw this thing away from us.
Okay. Take her, Chappie!
- Yo-Landi: No! No!
- Ninja: Go, Chappie!
- Yo-Landi: No, Ninja.
- Ninja: Go!
Ninja, don't leave me!
Ninja!
Hey...!
Hey,
Who's that huh?
Oh, my gosh.
Look at you.
You think you're a hero.
Yo-Landi: Ninja!
No, mommy! What you doing?
What you doing?
Come on! Come!
Come on, do it!
Come on...!
Do it...!
Do it...!
Do it... ...!
This is your day of reckoning,
boy.
What the hell's going on?
Come back.
Come back.
No, no, no.
Impossible.
Wake up, mommy!
Mommy, please!
Come here.
Maker,
who did this to mommy?
I know who.
Why?
Why do they do the hurtings?
Daddy, stay there!
Chappie is gonna crush the man!
Unh.
Chappie.
- Uh!
I'm gonna get the bad man
from the van!
Aw!
You godless freak!
Godless!
No.
You don't use guns.
I'm gonna crush you,
bad man!
I'm gonna crush you
for hurting my mommy!
You...
are a very bad man.
Now...
I forgive you, bad man.
-
- Unh!
Deon:
Chappie.
what?
There's a problem.
Look.
There's only one droid.
For Christ sake, Chappie.
Just save yourself.
It's gonna be okay.
Stay with me, Deon.
Whoa.
The police are here now.
Okay,
you ready?
Man: Get it open.
Come on.
Maker,
please take it slow.
This will be very disorientating
for a human.
Officer:
This isn't working.
Listen.
Do you have an angle grinder
or something? Come on.
Maker?
Do you have pain?
No, Chappie.
I'm... I'm alive.
Chappie.
We have to help you now.
Think, damn it.
Think.
It's okay, maker.
You got saved.
No, Chappie. Wait.
I know!
Vincent uploaded his program
from this terminal.
There are hundreds of bodies
all over the city. Here it is!
Deon:
Hurry! Plug that in.
Vincent set up a protocol
to remotely deactivate the droids.
I think we can use it
to move you to a new body.
Okay! Okay!
I'm going quickly!
Okay.
Okay.
Come on, Chappie.
Come on.
I'm scared.
What if it doesn't work?
And you can never break
a promise.
Come on.
Let's do this.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's go, boys! Let's go.
Tetravaal, stay back!
Now, boys, go, go, go!
it's me.
I'm sorry you had
to leave your other body, Maker.
But it was the only way
to save you.
Come, Maker.
Come quickly.
- Yo-Landi:
Yo-Landi:  Okay,
thinking.
Yo-Landi: Yeah...
Chappie:
It's working, mommy.
It's just a temporary body,
mommy.
You don't have to go
to the next place.
Now we are both black sheeps,
mommy.
no fucking around
trying to fuck with
my game
I'm hard to miss
