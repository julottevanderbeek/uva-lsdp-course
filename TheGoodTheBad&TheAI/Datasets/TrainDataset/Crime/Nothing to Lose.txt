Hello...
What are you up to?
Back off, ass!
You... you may not jump.
If you jump,
I’ll be in big trouble.
Please don’t.
What has that to do with you?
Well, if you jump but I don’t,
then they will think I..
I've pushed you.
I would become your murderer.
That's your problem.
That's no concern of mine.
Don’t do it. Don’t do it.
Wait. Listen to me.
I don’t want to keep you from
jumping. Don’t get me wrong.
It’s just that I want to commit suicide too.
If you’re desperate to do it,
then,
then we should do it together.
Give me some time, OK?
Why should we do it together?
You can tell me that?
I don’t even know you.
I don’t want them thinking
we were a couple.
A couple that went mad.
What’s this staring?
Ah, now I understand you.
You’re not here to commit suicide, right?
You're not even wearing a shirt.
Are you here to sunbathe or what?
Or do you have a date with a girl
and want to sleep with her?
You’ve got a bad mouth,
you sassy goat.
You're off your rocker.
You’re sick.
Then, why don’t you jump,
I won’t hold you back.
I want you to jump first,
you sick ass-hole.
Jump! I want to watch.
You jump first.
- No, you jump first.
No, you first!
- You first!
No, you first!
- No, after you!
I decided not to jump today.
If I wouldn’t have lacked the courage
I would have done it.
I nearly did it.
- Why do you want to die anyway?
I have a lot of gambling debts.
There’s no point in living on.
And you? Why do you want to die?
Are you in the need of it?
Well, why not? It’s the same for me.
Everybody hates me. All are against me.
And of course I hate them too.
I ignore them.
They are unconcerned about me.
I’m tired of this game.
I don’t want to play it anymore.
Well, that really sounds terrible.
What now?
You still want to jump?
What about you?
- I’m too weak.
Then let’s go eat.
I’m really hungry.
Then you won’t jump?
Well, you just said it.
If you want to commit suicide
you need more strength.
And I’m too tired to jump.
I'm trembling with hunger.
You understand?
We'll make a decision after
we have had enough.
What’s your name?
- Somchai.
What?
- Somchai.
Hey, and you?
- Gogo.
Why from that building?
You don’t even live there.
I don't know.
I just remember...
Well, after I have lost all my money,
I wanted to commit suicide.
And as I closed to the building,
somebody,
it was a man,
he waved at me.
I entered the building.
Then he led me to the roof.
Now that I think about it,
he probably was a ghost.
Yes, I suppose that’s how it was.
That sounds mysterious.
You mean, he has known
about your death wish
and just wanted to help you die?
Maybe he wanted to screw you.
Yes, maybe. Never mind.
He disappeared and I’m still living.
And what about you?
It’s all about money.
I owe someone 30,000 Dollar.
What, 30,000?! 30,000 Dollar?
What are you going to do now?
How do you want to pay it back?
- You’re an idiot, my sweetie.
I don't even think about paying back.
I’m not that dumb.
If I had the money
I would have some nice days
and then jump down some place.
Stop it. I’m getting...
What was wrong with you?
- Nothing. Had to make a call.
I see.
- Have you paid?
You dumbass. Since when do the
dead have to pay for their meals?
He, he, he, he, he!
Was that you?
I was on the way to the toilet.
Haven’t managed to get there in time.
Hey! Nothing wrong about that.
Shit happens.
You didn’t eat for a long time,
the whole excitement,
the stomach doesn’t like that,
so he sends it all back.
It doesn’t concern you
that we have not paid.
But it seems to amuse you when I puke.
Seems like it bothers you the fact
that I’m in a good mood
and you’re not, you stinky sour puss.
I cannot listen to someone
Who’s going through life with such a kisser?
Look who’s talking.
Didn’t you want to chuck away
your life just now?
Hey, argue elsewhere ass-holes.
That’s my parking lot.
You said we aren’t afraid of death, right?
Maybe death is afraid of us?
C’mon, let’s drive.
- I don’t know
how to run this gear shift.
- I don’t know either.
What do we do now?
- We give the car back.
Where to?
What do we want to do? Where are
we driving to? You got an idea?
We’re going to a sunny place.
We will find something.
Hey, my money!
No, no, not so.
That makes 75 Baht.
Now you have seen them.
You owe me 25.
What? What do you mean?
- One look at my boobs costs 100.
I owe you 75 for the drive,
you then owe me 25. Right?
Say, do you want to pay
everything like that?
Then you’ll need other clothes, I guess.
Up yours, ass-hole!
Piss off!
Where are you going?
Into that bank?
You have money?
- Of course no.
I’ll get some. They have a lot.
Don’t worry, you can stay here.
I do it alone.
I want to take out my money
and close my account.
Understood. As you wish.
Hey, everything OK?
Don’t make such a face.
That’s my money, and I withdrew it.
You’re always in a bad mood.
It’s no fun with you.
I didn't know what you’re up to.
Yeah, right. You could have taken
the gun from the guard easily.
But you’re a coward.
What do you mean?
What should I do with the gun?
It was not my intention to steal,
but if, then we would be
in deep trouble.
- Where are we going now?
I’m slowly beginning to like
your stupid questions.
A room for two?
- Yes. You got one?
Please fill out this form
and read the rules of the house
on that wall over there.
Firstly: The rooms are only being rented
to persons aged at least 18.
Secondly: The guests have to specify
their profession and the reason of their stop.
Thirdly: The guests are not allowed
to carry a weapon or explosives.
Fourthly: Having sex is
only allowed on the beds.
Is this a monastery or a hotel?
Who cares?
The sex thing is only a joke, right?
Why only on the bed?
Never mind. Do it wherever you want to.
Agreed. That’s a nice cottage.
What’s your job?
- Job’s out.
And what’s your relationship?
Till now we’re just friends.
That could change soon.
Yes, she’s right.
We’ll soon be more than friends.
Hey, but you’re not here
to kill yourselves, right?
Are you deaf?
Think before speaking.
We’re here to make sex,
we told you.
For that I wouldn’t choose
such a miserable gin palace.
No, I have taste.
- And how long do you want to rent it?
For the time being 3 days.
- 500 Baht prepayment for 3 days.
C’mon. Show him what you’ve got.
I won’t look.
Listen, he doesn’t go for that.
Looking good? So, here are the 500 Baht.
Feels good, aunt it?
What are you doing?
Did you rent the room just for the TV?
Yes. What are you thinking?
What we’re doing here, my friend?
Did you really think
I rented this miserable hole
just for fucking you?
Poor you. Keep your trousers zipped.
Get lost, you pig! Don’t bother me!
I just don’t want to be alone
that’s all. No sex, understood?
Don’t get any stupid ideas, boy.
Are you masturbating?
Feeling better now?
Then we can finally sleep.
Hey, I’m a normal man.
With normal needs. Understand?
And you are very sexy.
You should feel flattered.
I’m sorry,
I’m not keen on that.
Besides, I don’t trust you.
There’s something weird about you.
Where of are living?
You have gambling debts, you say?
Your damn passion for gambling has ruined you.
Can’t you quit it?
You won’t survive it.
I really tried to quit.
It won’t work. I start again and again.
You cannot understand anyway.
Do you get high through gambling?
Explain it to me.
Is it as lustful as sex?
Much better.
And if you manage to win
then it’s even better
then having sex with two hot women
at the same time.
Maybe that would be something for me.
Yes. Tell you what.
A lot of people gamble.
Particularly rich people.
And there are no distinctions there.
I’m a regular. Everyone knows me.
Good service, nice atmosphere.
I win everytime.
Everyone watches me closely.
You’re feeling like a hero.
A hero which gets celebrated by everyone.
If you weren’t at a casino like that
till now, you should go there.
Spades win again.
Then you will experience it yourself.
And you can’t get away thereof.
Tomorrow we will go there together.
- Seriously?
Oh no, you?
You’re still alive?
What’s up?
How much are we gonna place?
C’mon, let’s go.
But I don’t want to go.
Go alone if you want to.
You have lost everything. C’mon.
- Hey, I can’t go yet.
Is it possible to borrow money?
I’d like 5,000 Baht.
Are you nuts?
- Shut up.
Give me chips worth of 5,000 Baht.
Hey, you deaf or what?
Or do you think I can’t pay back?
Why should I mistrust a beautiful girl like you?
She’s sweet. Besides, if I did,
he would vouch for you.
I’m sorry, but I’ve nothing to do with him.
We don’t belong together.
Ok, borrow as much as you want.
It’s free of interest.
Sweet. It’s free of interest. Awesome.
- But only for you, sweetie.
Don’t stare at my tits.
Give me the money!
Well, was it fun?
You’ve lost everything.
It was great. I really had an amazing feeling.
Nearly as exciting as smoking weed
and sucking a dick simultaneously.
You understand what I mean?
You know you are in deep shit now?
You borrowed 5,000 Baht
which you have to pay back.
Is this clear in your mind? And forget
the free of interest thing.
He will present you a nice bill.
So what?
That’s no concern of yours, is it?
If you’re scared, piss off.
I can cope with it myself.
You have nothing to do with it.
Are you thinking about suicide again?
Why did we come here?
Well, maybe. But I want to change clothes first.
Wait outside. And don’t run away.
You’re living here, eh?
Why do you behave in your own house
like a thief?
I’ve a shitload of fear of my boyfriend.
And now shut up and wait here.
Is Jackie here?
What are you doing here?
- Nothing. Zilch.
Are you done with, eh,
stealing from yourself?
Idiot! Mind your own business. Understood?
Where are you right now?
Who was it? Loan-shark?
- Nothing important. Let’s go.
Wait here. I have to go in there.
It shouldn’t take long.
Hello. Nice car.
- You think so?
If you have the time,
I can take you for a ride.
Oh, why don’t you keep your hands off the women.
How now? Why do you have so many wigs?
I like to look good.
That’s no concern of yours.
Go, change your clothes.
You stink, my sweetheart.
Is this your friends?
That even fits me.
Tell me, that crap really makes you high, huh?
You never did it?
It’s like an orgasm.
I feel light.
I’m weightless, without burdens.
Time seems to stop.
Sex is best if you’ve smoked weed beforehand.
Orgasms seems to last for hours.
When listening to the music,
you can hear tones
you've never heard before.
And you’re doing things you hadn’t
the guts to do before.
Things you were afraid of.
By the way, I also smoked weed
the day I wanted to jump down.
Wouldn’t have had the courage otherwise.
You get that high?
Stop getting on my nerves with
your questions. Smoke!
What’s got into you?
Well, how was it?
Who’s that?
Oh, all of you are ass-holes.
You finished?
What’s up?
- Nothing.
I’m making a routine check.
Also the rent is due.
Why are you crying, madam?
- What’s that to you?
These women.
Do you have to watch TV so early?
Go and have a shower.
Get your clothes on, we’re going out.
- Where to? Early morning exercise?
Funny. We’ll search for a cash machine.
- You still got money?
Well, then let’s go.
Good afternoon.
Go to her. Calm and friendly.
Pretend you wanna pay.
As she’s taking your money,
the drawer will open up.
Then take all the money and run.
Understood?
I will pretend chasing you.
Take the basket.
But you said we are here to take
money from the cash machine.
Money is money. Either it’s out
of the checkout or out of the cash machine.
What’s the difference?
We’re broke, sweetie.
What do we need the money for?
Aren’t you paying by showing your tits?
Shut up. Haven't you heard?
The landlord wants the rent?
And if we don’t pay,
we’ll have to sleep on the street.
You still,
you still can go home.
I’m sorry, I can’t.
Just do what I tell you.
Or quit being attached to me like a limpet.
You have the better reflexes.
Let’s exchange appearances, ok?
You're a man or what?
- I'm.. Yes, I’m a man.
Do you have an idea how difficult it is
to keep my fingers away from you every night?
I don't care a pap for it.
Take the 100 Baht and go over.
I’m watching you. Go.
I’ll be back.
Stop! Stand still!
You’re good for nothing, you bugger.
But you can run as fast as Ben Johnson.
That was my first time.
Next time will be better.
Hey, here, that’s for you.
But last time
you didn’t pay the rent.
Thus you get nothing now.
It’s ok. I’m fine, as long as I’m alive
and got something to eat.
You mean it?
And you think you’re a man?
Of course.
And I’m willing to demonstr...
Shut up! I can’t bear you anymore.
Somchai.
Where have you been?
Not again. Slow down.
Was that your girlfriend?
You’ve got queer taste.
She looks like an old cow.
But old cows also have something
interesting, I can understand you.
They surely have wonderful udders.
Hey, if it amuses you that much
you can insult me,
but leave her out of the game, ok?
There you are. 80,000 Baht.
That’s all I have. I’m sorry.
This is the last time
I’m paying your debts, Somchai.
What do you want?
You haven’t changed in the last ten years.
You made more and more debts.
How should this go on?
Er, you want to order something?
- You have to...
Some water please.
Sister, I understand you’re hating me
- I don’t hate you.
We belong together.
I’d always help you.
Even if you’re problems get worse.
Whatever mistakes you make.
I never hate you.
I’m plainly disappointed.
Next week’s your birthday.
Here’s a shirt from my shop.
A gift. I hope,
when wearing this shirt,
you’ll be starting a new life.
Happy birthday, your sister.
Okay. Stop the tape right here.
And play back slowly.
Okay, stop here.
Did you notice?
That guy is totally calm.
Everything was planned thorough.
Looks like he isn’t involved at all,
but that’s not true.
It was all planned.
Even the thing with the sanitary napkin.
He began
by distracting the till girl.
He distracted her with the sanitary napkin,
yes, I’m sure,
whilst the drawer was open.
And then came the woman.
She came out of the blue.
She caught the till girl off guard.
And now the most awesome part.
What did he tell her?
- You young people don’t have a clue.
During my internship at the FBI
I learnt lip-reading.
Therefore I can see,
what he said before leaving.
It’s clearly to see:
I’ll... be... back.
That’s what a character
out of a Maverick comic would say.
He knows, that the police will look at this,
and that there are people like me.
He wants to take on the police of Bangkok.
Get to work! Keep everyone busy with this case.
Understood? The compound
is being monitored constantly.
Bring their stories to me.
Open up a file with the name,
Moment, Bonnie and Clyde.
- Understood.
I well get you two.
You’ll be surprised.
So, that was your sister.
She’s worried about you.
Anyway, she didn’t forget your birthday.
But don’t tell me the date.
I have no gift for you.
Nothing in the news about us.
It’s too early.
Don’t bother me.
I just want to know
who has died today.
Do you get it?
Hey, why do you have to be so bitchy?
Bitchy is much better than heartless.
Listen to me. A good man wouldn’t abandon you.
But most men do it
because they are not good.
Why, why don’t you search elsewhere?
Can men really understand what women want?
Is that possible?
Who do you think I am?
- You don’t know yourself.
You can find something with me,
that no man can give you.
I’m hungry. I have to eat.
Pay day, guys. Your time limit is over.
Pay or else you will regret it.
With interest that makes up 20,000 Baht.
What? Why so much?
I told ya.
Do you understand now?
I don’t have the money now.
Give me two days.
Yeah, right. Only two days.
Tell your boss that's what I said.
I’m one of his regulars.
Tell him yourself.
I’m curious if he believes you.
We will find a way.
You have sex with me,
and that’s for the interest.
I’ll be nice to you.
That’s, that’s not right.
That’s not as per agreement.
I was there. All without interest.
Do you have the money? Than pay.
- Yes,
Yes, first 300 Baht.
Boot him out.
- Wait, wait, I raise it.
Where do you bring him to? Where?
- Where to? What do you think?
You impotent old man want to shag me?
You pig!
Beware. I’ll bite your dick off.
What’s up? Doesn’t your old noodle
want to get up?
Hey, give me back my girlfriend.
That’s enough money
to buy her free.
Fuck it. Nobody goes,
not until I’m done with this bitch.
Somchai! Help me!
That’s not enough. That’s not even
enough for Somchais interest.
Are you a man?
I helped you last time,
even though I had no money myself.
How dare touch my girl, you pig!
Thank you, for rescuing me.
- That wasn’t the first time.
I don’t know. Maybe I saved you last time.
I wanted to kill him for a long time.
Why?
- Nothing. Not important.
You know what? I changed my opinion of you.
Why? What’s different?
- You were brave.
I have no fear. No fear of death.
What of should I be afraid of?
Sometimes it’s possible to do everything.
Everything. As long as you take
responsibility for your doings.
That sounds sophisticated.
Go down one step.
Oh, I’m just talking nonsense.
That’s the shock from before.
Listen, we don’t rob shops anymore, ok?
I have a lot of money and chips.
Really? How much?
Have you counted?
Not bad.
Maybe we should bring it to the bank
and live from the interest.
Clean everything up.
Chief. Upstairs are 3 more dead bodies.
Are there any witnesses?
Yes. They say it were a man
and a woman, Chief.
But only the man has shot.
One witness can describe him.
We’ll catch him.
- A man and a woman.
That guy has murdered 8 people
Each of them with one bullet.
Very professional.
One man and one woman?
Excuse me, did you see the shooting?
Step back. Our witness.
There he is.
Did you see the murderers,
the man and the woman?
Yes, I did.
- And could you describe them?
They were, well...
Excuse, which broadcast station
is this? Is it live?
I’ll answer immediately.
Yes, this is ITV Live.
That’s a live broadcast.
Okay. They were out of the ordinary.
A great couple. Really cool.
The man looked a bit mean
but the woman had style.
They came in and went directly
into the room over there.
Later on, they shot their way back out.
The man wore sunglasses.
And he shot with one gun in each hand.
Yes, he looked even cooler then
the guys in Hollywood movies.
Before he left he said something to me.
What did he say?
- He said...
You shall gamble no longer.
Oh, and then he threw me a chip worth 10,000 Baht.
They think about themselves as modern Robin Hoods.
You know what to do.
- Yes, Sir.
Where were you during the shooting?
Luckily I had to go to the toilet before it started.
When I came back they already had left.
I simply had luck. Really.
Or else they surely would have killed me.
Or I could have handled them.
Hey, wake up. C’mon, wake up.
We’re on the first page.
Shit! What are we going to do now?
We have to go to the motel. C’mon.
- To the motel? Why there?
I have got to get my shirt.
Your shirt? Now that’s important.
Fair enough. I have to go there too.
My papers are still there.
What’s now? Is this your brother?
It’s too dark, I can’t see anything.
Turn on the light.
If I say no, can I go then?
I verified it. You're his only relative.
And he’s also your only relative.
Your brother has no criminal record.
He had a lot of small jobs,
nothing that last long.
Your father was an officer at the army.
Did he show your brother how to shoot?
I’m sorry. When Somchai was born,
my father was already dead.
Did he like to play with weapons as a child?
No, he loved to play with marbles.
Madam, I hope you will help us.
I’m sorry, I have nothing to say. Nothing.
You know more about him as I do.
Better use your time finding him
instead of talking to me.
I have no more to say.
If you capture him I don’t have to it. Thanks.
And now to some news that shocked the public.
For already a longer period
the neighbours have determined a curious smell.
Now a female dead body has been found
wrapped in plastic.
Isn’t that your apartment?
That’s impossible.
Look at that.
Come here. Look!
The police has also found a picture
of another woman that lived here.
That woman is aged about 20.
The neighbours describe her
as being inconspicuous, friendly
and living a very secluded life.
As it appears to be,
none of the tenants remember talking
to her, not even once.
Also about friends and relatives...
Who’s that? She looks like you.
Now I know why you always change your appearance.
I, I didn’t want to kill her.
She used me and then threw me away.
She taught me to mistrust men.
I didn’t want to kill her.
She destroyed my life.
You don’t need to explain.
I understand.
We can’t stay here any longer.
You killed one human, I killed eight.
That doesn’t make a difference anymore.
Shit! This shirt brings bad luck.
Hi. Do I speak with the police?
Yes, I’m calling because of Bonnie and Clyde.
Oh, do you give a reward for the information?
You pig!
Gogo, here!
I'll get it going this time.
Help, help! The two over there,
in the car, they are Bonnie and Clyde.
Shut the motor off and
get out of the car.
Gogo, it’s over.
Our goose is cooked. C’mon.
Get out of the car. Immediately!
Don’t fool around. Hands up!
Get in, quick!
Please be cautious with my car.
I hope he won’t die.
- He’s a cop.
Injuring him or killing him is the same.
Even so he shouldn’t die.
I don't want him to die.
But we’ve arrived at the point of no return.
One last time
we can put all one’s eggs in the basket.
If we succeed we can resume.
If not...
...we will resume too, but elsewhere.
Understood?
I first have to meet someone.
A police officer was injured at 36. Street.
The suspects are Bonnie and Clyde.
All units search for
a red cabrio, license number: CU 70-14.
Why don’t you look at me?
They’re searching after you.
And you have the heart to come here?
I... I have to tell you something.
I, I didn’t listen to you earlier.
That wasn’t right.
I thought, gambling would enrich my life.
That you don’t have to work hard.
That there’s always another way.
I didn’t know that gambling
would make everything worse.
Somchai, I never felt that my life is
hard or unbearable.
I like working.
I also think,
you should not run after money.
How much can you spend in life?
Tell me. Why are you gambling?
And at the end -
just look at yourself.
You don’t even have enough money
to buy some new shoes.
It’s some kind of disease.
Don’t allow it, it would be a shame
if you sneer at yourself some day.
Don’t worry. Everything is going to be alright.
I won’t disappoint you anymore.
I’ll pay back all debts.
You can count on that.
Yes, I know,
you have to hate me.
And that’s terrible for me....
Forgive me.
Hello!
Have your brother been here recently?
How old are you?
- 45.
I didn’t know someone aged 45
could ask such stupid questions.
Which one are we going to?
- Let us go to your bank.
Well, then I’ll need a bigger bag.
Hey, you haven’t paid yet.
Rest’s for you. Have a nice day.
You know you’re cocky?
- You shouldn’t hide good things.
Besides I want the men to remember me.
Interesting. When did you stop liking men?
You wait here. I do it.
Next please.
I want to open an account.
- What kind of account do you mean?
I want you to transfer
all the money to my account.
Listen carefully.
All exits are being monitored.
Surrender immediately.
You, down there, I have to tell you something.
We've only got the bank manager.
All other hostages are free.
I don’t want bloodshed.
Send someone upstairs
who’s got the authority to negotiate
so we can find a solution.
I repeat. All can be solved peacefully.
Whom are we going to send now?
The negotiator hasn’t arrived yet.
I wanted to meet the two anyway.
How are you doing?
Are you seriously injured?
Don’t worry. I surely won’t die this way.
Mister, please don’t kill me.
I have a wife and two children,
they need me.
Please don’t do me any harm.
Relax. I only kill people who deserve it.
Behave and nothing will happen to you.
Stop it and let the man go.
Keeping him as a hostage is useless.
You won’t get away with that.
Listen to me.
How old are you, commissar?
- Forty...
I don’t have to answer questions.
From now on I do the asking.
Understood? I question and you answer.
I wouldn’t be sure about that.
Listen.
You don’t seem to realize
how bad your position is.
Namely we have nothing to lose.
I could pick you off easily, ass-hole.
Somchai, listen to me.
You can still start over.
It’s too late for that.
I promised to pay all my debts.
And I will keep my promise.
Hopefully it’s enough,
'cause I won’t be able to get more.
I’m sorry, I ruined your shirt.
Somchai,
I want to tell you,
that I never ever sneered at you.
You know,
I just happened to like men again because of you.
Thanks.
So what’s your decision?
We are going to fly.
