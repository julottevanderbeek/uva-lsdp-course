THERE'S NOTHIN'
PERSONAL GOIN' ON HERE.
I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.
I LOVE KNOWING THAT ONE LEAK,

NIGHTMARE INTO A MEDIA FRENZY.
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
WE'RE GONNA GET THE DOPE BACK
BEFORE THAT EVER HAPPENS.
WHY DON'T YOU START BY
LOOKIN' RIGHT HERE?
BECAUSE THIS HAD TO HAVE BEEN
AN INSIDE JOB, AND I'M GONNA
FIND OUT ABOUT IT.
SANCHEZ, RUIZ,
YOU GUYS ARE LATE.
SOMEBODY PUT THIS IN
FOR TOXIC DRUG FUMES.
YEAH, THIS WAS A BRILLIANT
DESIGN. THIS WAS REALLY
INTELLIGENT. I LIKE THIS.
I DIDN'T ASK HOW HE FEELS.
I SAID, "WHAT DID HE SEE?"
WHAT DOES HE KNOW?
UH-HUH.
WHERE WERE Y'ALL
LAST NIGHT, MAN?
WHY DON'T Y'ALL HAVE YOUR
COUSINS BRING THE SHIT BACK

THIS WAS YOUR CASE.
YOU'RE BACK ON IT.
SANCHEZ, RUIZ, YOU BACK THEM UP
WITH WHATEVER THEY NEED.
- SHUT YOUR MOUTHS.

BUT IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIM;
HE WAS KILLED IN PRISON.
WHAT ABOUT HIS CREW?
THE REST OF THOSE IDIOTS DON'T
HAVE THE PRECISION TO DO THIS,
BUT...
IN CASE I'M WRONG,
CHECK THEM OUT.
THEY'D HAVE BEEN UP HERE

OH, PLEASE, LIKE

I WANNA MEET THE MAN
WHO WHUPPED YOUR ASS.
I WANNA MEET
WHO WHUPPED SHAFT'S ASS,
THAT'S WHAT I WANNA DO.

I TOLD YOU

NOT TO SHOOT UP A NEIGHBORHOOD!
NOT TO DO ANOTHER DEAD BODY!
JUST GET THE DOPE BACK

LOOK, CAP'N.
THIS WHOLE SITUATION

YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT
IT'S GETTIN' OUT OF CONTROL!
LOOK, MAN,

YET TODAY, CAPTAIN.
HEY, DO YOU WANT ME

CAPTAIN, THESE FOOLS
COULD HAVE GOTTEN A LOOK
AT MY LICENSE PLATE LAST NIGHT.
SO WHERE'S THE GIRL NOW?
- HIS PLACE.
- WHAT?
YOU LEFT HER BY HERSELF?
OUR ONLY FUCKIN' WITNESS?
YOU LEFT A STRANGE HOOKER
ALONE IN MY APARTMENT?
THE GIRL IS NOT A HOOKER,
AS FAR AS I KNOW.
I HAD TO STASH HER SOMEWHERE--
HER AND HER DOGS,
LUKE AND DUKIE.
SO YOU LEFT DOGS IN MY HOUSE?
SO THERE'S DOGS AND A HOOKER
IN MY HOUSE.
-HOW ABOUT YOU ADD SOME CHIMPS?
WE CAN HAVE A CARNIVAL.
-SHE WASN'T NO HOOKER.
HEY! SHUT UP!
FOR YEARS, SINCLAIR
HAS BEEN UP MY ASS, TRYIN'
TO PIN SOMETHIN' ON ME.
I'M ALWAYS TAKIN' IT
FOR YOU, RIGHT?
DO IT FOR ME.
NOW IF WE GET THIS WITNESS
TO I.D. THE SHOOTERS,
MAYBE WE CATCH OUR BAD GUYS.
BUT UNTIL THEN--
UNTIL THEN, YOU ARE MIKE LOWREY.

HEY, DOES IT LOOK LIKE I CARE?
WHATEVER IT TAKES, ALL RIGHT?
WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU?
THE SHOOTERS ARE GONNA MAKE
THEIR DROP IN FOUR DAYS?

I CAN'T BE SHACKED UP
WITH THAT WOMAN!
I HAVE A FAMILY TO LOOK AFTER.
MY WIFE WILL KILL MY ASS!
YOU DON'T LIKE
YOUR JOB?

-I KNOW YOU CAN HANDLE IT,
BUT I'M WORRYIN' ABOUT ME.
MIKE'S GONNA STAY HERE WITH
YOU AND THE KIDS, TAKE CARE OF
Y'ALL, JUST 'TIL I COME BACK.
WHO'S GONNA PICK
THE KIDS UP FROM DAY CARE?
MIKE CAN'T DO IT.
ARE YOU LISTENIN'
TO ME, BABY? I SAID MI--
I READ A BOOK...
THAT COULD PROBABLY
HELP Y'ALL.
