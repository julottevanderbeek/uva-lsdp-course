LINCOLN:
I didn't kill that man,
Michael.
If you didn't kill
Terrence Steadman,
how the hell did someone
make it look like you did?
I'm getting you
out of here.
That's impossible.
Not if you designed
the place, it isn't.
Better be open, bro.
You're asking me
to break the law.
I'm asking you
to make a mistake;
forget to lock up.
We're in.
Who killed Terrence Steadman?
Nobody.
Terrence Steadman's
still alive.
Hello, Terrence.
Sound the alarm!
What's going on?
Hey!
No! No!
What do we do now?
We run.
The escapees, who were they?
Got a list right here.
Read it to me, if you could.
Michael Scofield,
structural engineer,
Benjamin Miles Franklin,
eight years for possession
of stolen goods.
John Abruzzi,
don of the crime family
of the same name.
Life without parole for
conspiracy to commit murder.
60 years
for second-degree murder.
Fernando Sucre,
five years
for aggravated robbery.
David "Tweener" Apolskis,
Theodore "T-Bag"
Bagwell,
life for six counts
of kidnapping, rape
And Lincoln Burrows,
for the murder
of President Reynold's brother.
How long has it been since
they got over the wall?
Scofield-- he and Burrows
were brothers.
That's right.
And he's the mastermind
of this whole thing.
That's what
they're saying.
I want everything
they've got on him.
* *
Where are they?
What the hell is that?
Let's go.
All we got to do is make
it to the other side.
What?
Make it to the other side.
Come on, guys!
Pick it up!
The thing is
gaining speed, man!
It's going
too fast!
Go through!
What?
Go through!
Go!
BELLICK:
Freeze!
I will gun you down, Scofield!
Where's the aerial
and the others?
They're back on
the ground refueling.
Son of a bitch.
WOMAN:
Sir,
Media's ready.
I'd like to, uh, talk about
John Wilkes Booth for a moment
if I could,
Abraham Lincoln's killer.
it took to find him.
In his journal during
this period, he wrote
that the shadow was his friend,
the night his domain.
He acknowledged that whatever
neuroses drove the criminal
to commit the original crime
is compounded,
by the sounds of dogs
at his heels.
Fear becomes paranoia,
I bring this up,
because, in 140 years,
the fundamental mind of the
escaped man has not changed.
The escaped man is still human.
He is still afraid,
and he will stop at nothing
in his attempt at flight.
while our quarry has shadow
and night as his ally,
we have something far greater:
television.
I would encourage everyone
who is watching,
everyone in this country
to take a good look
at these faces.
These men right here
are now the eight-most-wanted
men in America.
I thought I thought this out.
You saw all those guys
back there?
The key is they're back there,
and we're up here.
Yeah, and how long
is that going to last?
Yeah, especially since
we don't have a pot to piss in
thanks to Abruzzi's
magically disappearing jet.
Hey, you were never going
to be on that plane, brother.
And don't think
I don't know
where you were going
either, Scofield.
Where am I going?
Oh, I don't know.
Utah?
When were you planning
on telling us about
the money, man?
What money?
$5 million that
Westmoreland planted
in the desert in Utah.
You don't know
what you're talking about.
Wait, wait.
What money?
Warden?
It's a little early
for the FBI to be showing up,
don't you think?
Look, I get it.
It's still your investigation,
but once those criminals
cross state lines,
it'll become a federal matter.
Yeah, well, that is not going
to happen.
I hope you're right.
That's why I was going
to suggest that we cut
through any interagency
politics from the outset.
Full transparency.
Absolutely.
Good.
Then maybe you can tell
me about Dr. Tancredi.
There's nothing to tell.
From what I'm hearing,
she may have abetted
the escapees;
opened the door that
allowed them to get out.
Like I said,
there's nothing to tell.
You're not being very
transparent, Warden.
Look, I don't
discuss my staff.
Maybe you should,
because she may
be the key to this thing.
We need to speak
with her.
Right now, Mr. Mahone,
she's not going to be
speaking with anyone.
How are we doing?
Well, the IVs
are hydrating her.
We got her on a
naloxone infusion,
half milligram per hour.
What do you think
the chances are?
Well, we've done
everything on our end.
It's really
up to her.
Either she fights
and lives, or she
quits and dies.
Hey! What do you think...
Do whatever thing
you got to do, man.
Oh, and...
boy... you call the cops,
I will put this thing
right here...
...in your eye.
Thank you.
MAHONE:
Structural engineer, huh?
IVES:
Not the kind
you'd expect to get
that much ink.
Not the kind at all.
How long do you think it'd take
to get something like that?
Hundred hours... 200.
Tattoo artist
who gave it to him
must have spent
a lot of time on him then.
I'll find out who it was.
Mr. Bellick.
Don't talk to me.
Fine, but it's going to make
collaboration kind of hard.
Collaboration?
I got men out here
in harm's way,
and you're giving
press conferences.
The press is a tool.
It'll bring those men back
quicker than bloodhounds will.
We don't need you.
We're hot on
these guys' trail,
and it's just a matter of
time till we nail them.
The problem I find
with being on a trail
is that by definition you'll
always be behind your prey.
We'll see about that.
STEADMAN:
I'm not armed.
VERONICA:
You'll have to excuse me
if I'm a little short on trust
at the moment.
I assure you,
young woman,
I'm the furthest
thing from a threat.
I think the Percocet
pretty much ensures that.
Good, then you won't mind
if I capture this moment
for posterity.
Won't do you any good.
You don't care that someone's
going to be executed
for your murder
while you're just sitting here.
I'm not the one
choose Lincoln Burrows
as the fall guy.
Who did?
Your sister, the president?
You don't understand.
I'm a prisoner to all of this.
Oh, come on.
You could have come forward.
You could have stopped
this thing before it even
got started.
No, I really am a prisoner.
And now, you are, too.
The moment
you let that door shut
behind you.
Didn't it strike you as curious
that there wasn't any security
out there?
The doors only open
from the outside.
The glass is two inches thick,
bulletproof.
There's no getting out of here,
young woman.
LINCOLN:
We got to dump them now.
Can't.
They know about Utah.
All the more reason
to dump them.
If they get caught,
they feds will know
exactly where we're going.
We'll tell them.
We just got to make
sure they stay afloat
until we're off in Utah,
doing what we got to do.
You really think
the money's going to be there?
Charles might have had
a flexible relationship
with the truth,
but at the end...
at the end, there'd
be no reason for him
to lie about it.
I figure once we bag it,
we cross over into Mexico,
take a whole bunch of bumpy
second-class bus rides
till we hit Panama.
LINCOLN:
You really got a fix on this
dive shop thing, huh?
Yeah.
Right now, I wouldn't
mind swinging in a hammock
for the next
ten or 20 years.
We got half the country
after us.
We ain't making it
to Panama or Utah.
Not without help.
Veronica can't help us.
How can you say that?
We don't have money, clothes...
I already got all that.
I thought the plan
was Abruzzi's jet.
Abruzzi's jet
was Plan A.
Then we got...
Everything we need.
Where?
Storage.
MAHONE:
Scofield designed the tattoo,
not you?
WOMAN:
He brought the entire thing in,
every element.
I mean, look at it; it's
the freakin' Sistine Chapel.
I knew the guy was an engineer
or whatever,
but man, his skill as an
artist was unbelievable.
What else?
What can you tell me
about him as a person?
Uh, he was cool,
you know.
But talk about
a detail nazi.
Everything had
to be perfect,
exactly as he drew it.
I always sort of had the feeling
that the whole thing
was some sort of inside joke
that only he
was in on.
We have your number,
right?
Yeah.
I may be calling you.
Thank you.
Foley!
What was the name
of that long road
we took to get
to the prison?
English Boulevard.
And out in front of the prison,
the two streets
that intersect with it?
Fitz and Percy. Why?
Thank you.
Saddle up.
ABRUZZI:
Where we going?
Somewhere
where we can stop being cons
and start being civilians.
You know, why don't
you cut out all the
riddles, Snowflake,
and just give it
to us straight.
Hey, hey, hey.
What?
Hi.
Hi.
C-NOTE:
Hey...
little one.
What are you doing?
Well, uh...
We're just fishing.
With no poles?
Well, we like to fish
with our hands.
SUCRE:
Yes, eh...
hand-fishing.
I think the question is,
What are you doing
out here?
Hunting.
MAN:
Gracie?
Gracie, get away.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're those guys
from Fox River.
Don't-don't any
of you move a freakin' muscle.
Get away from her!
Okay, okay, just..
relax, relax.
ABRUZZI:
Sir...
You stay where you are.
Let her go.
Right now.
You let her go!
Let go of the girl.
Shut up!
MICHAEL:
John, put the girl down.
Drop the gun!
MICHAEL:
Put down the gun, John.
ABRUZZI:
Drop it now.
Put the gun down.
One.
MICHAEL:
Abruzzi, let her go.
I'll pull the trigger.
Two!
Good boy.
Get the gun.
Pick it up!
Don't you hurt her, don't you...
Hey!
:
You're going to be all right.
Okay?
Run to Daddy.
I ain't going to say
anything, to anybody, man.
MICHAEL:???
-Where's your car?
-Up on the road.
Keys.
FOLEY:
You're being considered
an accessory to this;
you know that, don't you?
I know very little right now.
You opened the door
to the infirmary
that allowed Scofield
to escape,
didn't you?
No.
Did you have a sexual
relationship with Scofield?
No.
But you had feelings
for him.
Seven other men got out,
you know.
Who?
Oh, I am sorry, sir.
It's Saturday;
we're not open.
Well, that's sort of
the point.
Sorry, sir?
See, I'm going to need
some work done,
and I'm going to need
it done privately.
I'm sorry, you said you
needed the work done?
This is a medical clinic,
isn't it?
Well, of course it is, sir,
but for animals.
Oh, man, what
happened to you?
You need medical
attention.
Sir, listen...
Hold up.
I'm going to
get an ambulance.
Nobody's going to be doing
any calling here, Doctor.
Fine.
That's right.
Wh-What do you want?
C-NOTE:
You know what?
That's it. I want Eye-Tie out
of the car right now, man.
That was a little girl!
Don't you have a heart?
God!
I have a
daughter.
I have a
little girl!
I got one, too.
But if I hadn't done
what I had to do,
we wouldn't be on
our way to see 'em
right now, would we?
Turn right up there.
C-NOTE:
Whoa, whoa.
Hold on. Where we going?
MICHAEL:
Oswego.
That's west, man.
We need to go east.
My family's back
in Chicago.
And you think
the cops don't know about it?
You think
they're not just
sitting there, waiting for you
to come running back home?
What's the matter
with you?
SUCRE:
Well, what about
New York?
What about it?
My girl's
pregnant, bro.
Understand your love
is your weakness right now,
and they know about it.
MICHAEL:
Doesn't mean it
has to stop you.
You just got
to be smart about it.
Get to Oswego.
Oswego was not
on the way, Snowflake.
MICHAEL:
It's not
where Oswego is.
It's what's in Oswego.
Captain, Scofield's credit
card transaction history.
Spent a lot of money here
in Will County
before he was incarcerated?
Exactly.
He was from Chicago.
Why does a guy from Chicago
come all the way out here
and spend north of eight grand
in all these places
in little over a month?
Car wash, voice mail,
storage, car rental...
We got guys
looking into it.
Good.
Hey, Captain, what about the
Feds? Should we tell them?
What do you think?
Captain Bellick?
Captain Bellick?
We got something.
Hunter up by Tamarack just
ran into five of the cons.
MAHONE:
So this is
where Scofield lived?
IVES:
Yeah, up until about two months
ago when he was incarcerated.
Mother's dead,
father's a deadbeat.
You got nothing in the
whole world but your brother.
So you plan.
And you scheme for months...
...till you get it right.
And then you destroy
all the evidence.
I want divers down in the river.
You won't get
cell coverage.
We're in the middle
of nowhere.
:
Digital carriers don't have
cell towers way out here
in Western Montana.
How about shutting up, Terrence?
Just trying to save
you some effort.
They're like a
web, these people.
The harder you struggle,
the worse it gets.
Sounds to me like a coward
trying to justify himself.
If I stay out of the way
and stay quiet, I stay alive.
That's what they
said; that's what
they told me.
And you're willing
to live like this,
in a hermetically-sealed box
while everything out there
goes to hell?
Self-preservation is
a strong motivator.
So is the truth.
Don't.
Young woman?
Don't.
How you doing, buddy?
I'm pretty freaked out,
that's how I'm doing.
They took your car, didn't they?
Cherokee.
Yeah.
Which way did they go?
Up that way north
toward Oswego.
Oswego. Pardon me.
Scofield's paperwork--
get it, Jimmy.
The credit card stuff.
Right here, Captain.
Of course.
Where is he going to put all
the crap you need to disappear?
We're going
to Oswego, boys.
You have a visitor.
Thank you.
Thanks.
You look disappointed.
No. I thought you were going
to be my father.
You heard from him?
His office.
Well, brought you a change
of clothes.
Figured, you know...
Thanks.
And your purse.
You left it in the infirmary.
I'm in a lot of trouble,
I think.
I, um...
I need
to apologize to you.
They threatened my job
if I didn't talk, and...
No, no, no, no. No.
One thing you learn
when you're walking the steps
is that you never
outsource a blame
that belongs
in your own backyard.
Well,
you're not the first
correctional worker
that fell for a con,
trust me.
He never cared.
Not one bit.
What are you thinking about?
Mistakes.
You had to do it.
Not like I did.
I ruined her life.
Well, there's nothing
you can do about it now.
That's not true.
You fell for her, huh?
Where's Oswego?
Half mile maybe.
Good.
What are you going to do,
Terrence, shoot me?
Blow my guts
all over this house? Then what?
You can't leave, remember?
You kill me,
you're stuck with me.
I'm safe here.
You're a prisoner here.
But I'm still
breathing.
If I go outside... one step,
I won't be.
You look at me...
like I'm the devil.
I gave up my family.
My teeth.
I eat Percocet
all day
just to dull the pain
of my miserable existence.
You have no idea
what I've been through.
Don't.
MAN :
Blackfoot Sheriff's Department.
Hello. My name's
Veronica Donovan.
I need you to send a unit
to the house at the end
of Light Road
as soon as possible.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but are you
calling to report a crime?
Yeah.
By the President
of the United States.
Send the car.
I'm sorry, sir, I-I don't think
I can do this.
There are nerves...
Look, you need a
specialist, okay?
I don't...
You-You need somebody
who knows what
they're doing.
I don't have the luxury
of choice here, Doctor.
My hand has been in that box
for hours now.
It is dying.
Sir, I am not capable
of doing this.
I only have one hand,
but I could
stick this in your neck before
you get to that door.
Now, if that's not incentive
enough for you,
I see that
you have a Mrs. Gudat out there.
With a name like that
in a county like this,
old Mrs. Gudat would not be
too hard to find now, would she?
Fine.
I can promise you nothing.
Story of my life.
I'll have to put you under.
Do I really look
that stupid?
Sir, I cannot do
a procedure like this
without an anesthetic.
I have to cut
away dead flesh.
Nobody can undergo
a procedure like this
without an
anesthetic!
I ain't nobody.
IVES:
Schweitzer was
the plumbing company
that made the toilet
Scofield took off
to get out of his cell.
Allen bolt was the fitting.
It's all here,
isn't it?
It's amazing.
MAHONE:
Ripe Chance Woods.
There a place in the vicinity
with that name?
Got someone looking into it.
MAN:
DOC's moving on a
storage facility
in Oswego.
Captain, manager says
that Scofield's got
a lease on unit 164.
It's still active.
We got guys on 8th Street,
If they're in there,
Captain, we got 'em boxed.
We push right up
the gut, then.
Any one of them
makes a threatening move,
put a hole in 'em.
You got it.
Officer...
This is my collar,
smart guy.
Back the hell off.
MICHAEL:
Close the door.
Still nothing on this place?
Nope. They're coming back
with nothing.
No place by that name
anywhere in this country.
Or any other country,
for that matter.
Let's go.
Son of a bitch set us up.
Not one word.
Officer...
Nothing.
Oh.
Oh, that kid's clever.
It's not a place,
it's a name.
Your PDA, you got it?
Yeah.
Bring up the census
of this county.
Far back as it goes.
Somebody's going to see us.
Keep digging.
We're gonna go to hell, guys.
Swear to God,
we're gonna go to hell.
MICHAEL:
Help me out.
C-NOTE:
You are one sick cat,
you know that?
IVES:
What are you looking for?
We got to go to the cemetery.
Originally, this was
supposed to be
a week's worth of clothes
for me and Linc.
But, uh, figured you all need
just as much help
as we do, so...
You're just doing this
out of the goodness
of your heart, Fish?
That's right,
John, the heart.
You remember what
that is, don't you?
Damn, Snowflake,
this is tight, man.
It's like I said,
we got to stop being cons,
start being civilians.
Nice.
Trousers are a little bit
too short,
don't you think?
Chop your feet off.
You're good at that.
This jacket ain't exactly
the best thing,
you know what I'm saying?
You want variety,
hit Target.
Linc.
What do we got?
Money, passports...
pre-paid phone cards.
Archie Ryan?
Did you see mine?
Phineas McClintock.
Whoa. These?
Keys to a car
that's waiting for us
a couple hundred yards
from here.
That a two-of-us or five-of-us?
That's a two-of-us.
They know?
Not yet.
Guy-Guy-Guys, we got company.
* *
Guys, we got to roll.
How did he know?
We're civilians;
remember that.
Civilians.
Hey.
I'm sorry, uh.
Do you know what time it is?
No, sorry.
STEADMAN:
I can't go outside.
They'll kill me
as soon as I show my face.
You're wrong about that.
As soon as you show your face,
this whole thing
is gonna be over.
You can have
your life back, Terrence.
Promise?
I promise.
Hello.
V, it's me.
We're out.
Thank God you're okay.
I saw the news.
You got to stop.
I need you to turn yourself in.
What?
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc.
He's alive.
You're going to be exonerated.
Come in.
Steadman...
What are you talking about,
you found Steadman?
Terrence, come on, let's go.
Afternoon.
Veronica.
The police are here.
Look, I need you to stay
where you are.
Ma'am.
I don't want to lose you.
Ma'am, put the phone down.
What?
Mr. Steadman,
take a few steps back.
Ver... Veronica.
Veronica.
Oh, my God.
Veronica!
I thought you knew that
all calls to the local station
are routed through us.
This is federal land, remember?
Mm.
And, uh, as for
your little toy here,
it's contraband.
You gonna tell us
how you got it in there?
I brought it
when I got here.
Whatever for?
To protect myself.
Mm.
That's what we're here for,
remember?
* *
WOMAN :
In less than a day,
the trail has gone cold
in the pursuit of what are
now being called...
IVES:
Yeah, that's fine.
Stay on top of
it, all right?
DOC's still doing
a sweep of Oswego,
but the guys have
basically vanished.
I wouldn't be so sure
about that, Mr. Ives.
I don't know how you
can be so confident.
It's not like these guys left
a map where they're going.
Actually, that's
exactly what they did.
Scofield had the entire
thing on his body--
how to get out of that prison,
how to disappear afterward.
I promise you that it's
only a matter of time
before we know
everything
that is in
Scofield's head--
where he plans to run to,
how he plans to get there.
So when the time comes
that he does get there,
we'll be waiting for him.
