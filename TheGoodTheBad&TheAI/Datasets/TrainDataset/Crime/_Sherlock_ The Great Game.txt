MAN OUTSIDE SHOUTS COMMANDS
Just tell me what happened
from the beginning.
We had been to a bar,
nice place, and, er, I got chatting
with one of the waitresses,
and Karen weren't happy with that,
so...when we get back to the hotel,
we end up having
a bit of a ding-dong.
HE SIGHS
She's always getting at me,
saying I weren't a real man.
Wasn't a real man.
What?
It's not "weren't", it's "wasn't".
Oh.
Go on.
Well...then I don't know
how it happened,
but suddenly
there's a knife in my hands...
..and me old man was a butcher,
so I know how to handle knives.
He learned us how to cut up a beast.
Taught.
What?
Taught you how to cut up a beast.
Yeah, well, then I done it.
Did it.
Did it! Stabbed her,
over and over and over, and I looked
down, and she weren't...
..wasn't...
..moving no more.
Any more.
God help me, I dunno how it happened,
but it was an accident, I swear.
You've got to help me, Mr Holmes!
Everyone says you're the best.
Without you...
I'll get hung for this.
No, no, Mr Bewick, not at all.
Hanged, yes.

Bored.
What?!
Bored!
No...
GUNSHOT Bored!
GUNSHOT Bored!
Don't know what's got into
the criminal classes.
Good job I'm not one of them.
So you take it out on the wall?
The wall had it coming.
What about that Russian case? Belarus?
Open and shut domestic murder. Not worth my time.
Oh, shame
Anything in? I'm starving.
Oh, f...
There's a head.
A severed head!
Just tea for me, thanks.
No, there's a head in the fridge.
Yes? A bloody head! Well, where else
could I put it?
You don't mind, do you?
Well...
Got it from Barts morgue.
I'm measuring the coagulation
of saliva after death.
I see you've written up
the taxi driver case.
Er...yes.
A Study In Pink.
Nice.
Well, you know. Pink lady, pink case,
pink phone. There was a lot of pink.
Did you like it?
Um...no. Why not?
I thought you'd be flattered.
Flattered?! "Sherlock sees through
everything and everyone in seconds.
"What's incredible, though,
is how spectacularly ignorant he is
"about some things." Hang on,
I didn't mean that...
Oh, you meant "spectacularly
ignorant" in a nice way
Look, it doesn't matter to me who's Prime Minister or...
I know. ..who's sleeping with who...
Whether the Earth goes round the sun.
That again! It's not important!
Not impor...?!
It's primary school stuff. How can you not know that?
Well, if I ever did, I've deleted it.
Deleted it?
Listen. This is my hard drive,
and it only makes sense
to put things in there
that are useful. REALLY useful.
Ordinary people fill their heads
with all kinds of rubbish.
That makes it hard to get at
the stuff that matters. Do you see?
But it's the solar system!
Oh, hell! What does that matter?!
So we go round the sun. If we went round the moon,
or round and round the garden like a teddy
bear, it wouldn't make any difference!
All that matters to me is the work!
Without that, my brain rots!
Put that in your blog! Or, better still,
stop inflicting your opinions on the world!

He should have wrapped himself up
a bit more.
Look at that, Mrs Hudson.
Quiet.
Calm. Peaceful.
Isn't it hateful?
Oh, I'm sure something
will turn up, Sherlock.
A nice murder. That'll cheer you up.

Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine.
Gas leak, apparently.
PIZZICATO NOTE
I can't.
Can't?
Stuff I've got on is just too big.
I can't spare the time.
Never mind your usual trivia.
This is of national importance.
PIZZICATO NOTE How's the diet?
Fine.
Perhaps you can get
through to him, John.
What? I'm afraid my brother
can be very intransigent.
If you're so keen,
why don't you investigate it?
No. I can't possibly be away from the office for any
length of time. Not with the Korean elections so...
Well, you don't need to know
about that, do you?
Besides, a case like this,
it requires...legwork.
FALSE NOTE
How's Sarah, John?
How was the Lilo?
Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.
Oh, yes, of course.
How...? Oh, never mind.
Sherlock's business seems to be
booming since you and he became...
pals. What's he like to live with?
Hellish, I imagine.
I'm never bored.
Good. That's good, isn't it?
Andrew West, known as Westie
to his friends. Civil servant.
Found dead on the tracks
at Battersea station this morning
with his head smashed in.
Jumped in front of a train?
Seems the logical assumption.
But?
But?
Well, you wouldn't be here
if it was just an accident.
Hah!
The MoD is working on a new missile defence
system, the Bruce-Partington Program it's called.
The plans for it
were on a memory stick.
That wasn't very clever.
It's not the only copy. Oh.
But it is secret.
And missing.
Top secret?
Very. We think West
must have taken the memory stick.
We can't risk it falling
into the wrong hands.
You've got to find those plans,
Sherlock.
Don't make me order you.
I'd like to see you try.
Think it over.
Goodbye, John.
Mm.
See you very soon.

The surprising ones.
Obviously.
You'll love this. That explosion.
Gas leak, yes? No.
No? No. Made to look like one.

Hardly anything left of the place,

A VERY strong box,

The pink phone.
What, from The Study In Pink? Obviously, it's not
the same phone, but it's supposed to look like...
"Study In Pink"? You read his blog?
Of course. We all do.
Do you REALLY not know that
the Earth goes round the sun?
SHE SNIGGERS
It isn't the same phone.
This one's brand-new.
Someone's taken trouble to make it look the same,
which means your blog has a far wider readership.

A warning?
Some secret societies
used to send dried melon seeds,
orange pips, things like that -
five pips.
They're warning us
it's going to happen again.
I've seen this place before.
Hang on.
What's going to happen again?
Boom!
Mrs Hudson!
You had a look, didn't you, when you
first came to see about your flat?
The door's been opened, recently.
No, can't be. That's the only key.
I can't get anyone interested
in this flat.
It's the damp, I expect -
that's the curse of basements.
I'd a place once when I was first

So, who do you suppose it was?
Hmm?
Woman on the phone -

Oh, she doesn't matter,
she's just a hostage. No lead there.
I wasn't thinking about leads. You're
not going to be much use to her.

trace the call?
Bomber's too smart for that.
MOBILE BEEPS Pass my phone.

Text from your brother.
Delete it. Delete it? Plans are out

Well, Mycroft thinks there is.
He's texted you eight times.
Must be important. Then why didn't
he cancel his dental appointment?
His what?
Mycroft never texts if he can talk.
Andrew West stole the missile plans, tried
to sell them, got his head smashed in,
end of story.
The only mystery is why my brother is so determined
to bore me when somebody is being so interesting.

We're together.
Domestic bliss must suit you, Molly.
You've put on 3lb since I last saw you.
Two-and-a-half. No, three.
Sherlock.
He's not gay!
Why do you have to spoil...? He's
not! With that level of grooming?
Because he puts product in his
hair? I put product in my hair.
You wash your hair,
there's a difference.
Tinted eyelashes, signs of taurine
cream around the frown lines,
those tired, clubber's eyes.
Then there's his underwear.
His underwear?
Visible above the waistline.
Very particular brand.
Plus the suggestive fact that he
left his number under this dish.
I'd say you'd better break it off
now and save yourself the pain.
DOOR OPENS
Charming, well done
Just saving her time.
Isn't that kinder?
Kinder? No, no, Sherlock,
that wasn't kind.
Go on, then.
Hm?
You know what I do. Off you go.
Oh... No.
Go on.
I'm not going to let you humiliate me
while I... An outside eye,
a second opinion - it's very useful
to me. Yeah, right Really!
Fine.
CLEARS THROAT
Oh, they're just a pair of sh...
trainers. Good.
Um...
They're in good nick.
I'd say they were pretty new,
except the sole has been well worn, so the
owner must have had them for a while.
Er, very '80s.
Probably one of those retro designs.
You're on sparkling form.
What else?
They're quite big. A man's.
But...
But there's traces of a name
inside in felt-tip.
Adults don't write their names inside
their shoes, so these belong to a kid.
Excellent. What else?
Er...
That's it.
That's it.
How did I do?
Well, John.
Really well.
I mean, you missed almost everything
of importance, but, you know...
The owner loved these.
Scrubbed them clean.
Whitened them. Changed the laces
three...no, four times.
There are traces of flaky skin where his fingers
have come into contact with them, so he had eczema.
The shoes are more worn on the
inner side, so he had weak arches.
British-made, 20 years old.
they're original.
Limited edition -
two blue stripes, 1989.
There's still mud on them.
They look new.
Someone's kept them that way.
Quite a bit of mud caked
on the soles.
Analysis shows it's from Sussex
with London mud overlaying it.
How do you know? Pollen. Clear as a
map reference. South of the river.
This kid came to London from Sussex 20 years ago and
left the trainers behind. What happened to him?
Something bad.
He loved those shoes, remember.
He'd never leave them filthy.
Wouldn't let them go
unless he had to.
So, a child with big feet gets...
Oh!
What?
Carl Powers.
Sorry, who?
Carl Powers, John.
What is it?
It's where I began.
a school sports tournament, drowned in the pool.
Tragic accident. You wouldn't
remember it. But you remember.
Yes. Something fishy about it?
Nobody thought so.
Nobody except me. I was only a kid myself.
I read about it in the papers.
You started young, didn't you?
The boy, Carl Powers,
had some kind of fit in the water,
but by the time they got him out,
it was too late.
There was something wrong somewhere.
I couldn't get it out of my head.
What? His shoes. What about them?
They weren't there. I made a fuss.
I tried to get the police interested, but
nobody seemed to think it was important.
He'd left all the rest of his clothes in his
locker, but there was no sign of his shoes.
Until now.

about the stolen plans -
the missile plans.
Did he?
Yes. He's investigating now.
He's, er...investigating away.
I just wondered what else
you could tell me about the dead man.
Er, 27. Clerk at Vauxhall Cross.
MI6.
He was involved in the Bruce-Partington
Program in a minor capacity.
Security checks A-OK.
No known terrorist affiliations or sympathies.
Last seen by his fiancee
Lucy, love, I've got to go out.
I've got to see someone.
Westie!
He was found at Battersea, yes.
So he got on the train?
No.
What?
He had an Oyster card...
..but it hadn't been used.
He must have bought a ticket.
Hm. There was no ticket on the body.
Then... How did he end up with a bashed-in
brain on the tracks at Battersea?
That is the question -
the one I was rather hoping Sherlock
would provide an answer to.
How's he getting on?
He's fine.
And it is going...very well.
He's, um...
He's completely focused on it.
CLOCK TICKS
Poison!
What are you going on about?
Clostridium botulinum.
It's one of the deadliest poisons
on the planet.
Carl Powers.
Are you saying he was murdered?
Remember the shoelaces?
Mmm.
He suffered from eczema. It would be easy to
introduce the poison into his medication.
Two hours later he comes to London, the
poison paralyses the muscles and he drowns.
How come the autopsy didn't pick that up?
It's virtually undetectable. Nobody was looking for it.
There are still tiny traces of it
in the trainers
from where he put the cream
on his feet.
That's why they had to go. So how do we let the bomber know?
Get his attention, stop the clock.
The killer kept the shoes
all these years. Yes.
Meaning...
He's our bomber.

You're still hanging round him.
Yeah, well...

Very old friend of your husband's.
We, um...
we grew up together.
I'm sorry. Who? I don't think
he ever mentioned you.
Oh, he must have done. This is...
This is horrible.
I mean, I just can't believe it.
I only saw him the other day.
Same old Ian.
Not a care in the world.
Sorry... My husband has been
depressed for months. Who are you?
Really strange that he hired a car. Why would he do that?
It's a bit suspicious, isn't it?
No, it isn't. He forgot to renew
the tax on the car, that's all.
Ah, well! That was Ian.
That was Ian all over.
No, it wasn't.
NORMAL VOICE: Wasn't it? Interesting.
Who was that?
Why did you lie to her?
People don't like telling you things but they love
to contradict you. Past tense, did you notice?
What? I referred to her husband
in the past tense.
She joined in. Bit premature. They've only just found the car.
You think she murdered her husband?
That's not a mistake
a murderer would make. I see...
No, I don't. What am I seeing?
SALLY: Fishing.
Try fishing.

Yeah, lovely motor.
Mazda RX8.
Wouldn't mind one of them myself.
Is that one?

I can see you're not a car man, eh?
But surely you can afford one -
a Mazda, I mean. Yeah, fair point.
It's like working in a sweet shop. Once you start

Nice holiday, Mr Ewart? Eh? You've

No, it's sun beds, I'm afraid.
Too busy to get away. My wife

Um... Oh!
No, sorry.
Oh, well! Thank you very much

You've been very helpful.
Come on, John!
I've got change, if you still want to...

How much blood was on that seat,

How much? About a pint.
Not about. Exactly a pint.
That was their first mistake.
The blood's Ian Monkford's,
but it's been frozen.
Frozen?
There are clear signs.
I think Ian Monkford gave
a pint of his blood some time ago
and that's what they spread on the seat.
Who did? Janus Cars. The clue's in the name.
The god with two faces?
Exactly.
They provide a very special service.
If you've got any kind of a problem - money troubles,
bad marriage, whatever -
Janus Cars will help you disappear.
Ian Monkford was in trouble - financial at a
guess, he's a banker - couldn't see a way out.
But if he were to vanish,
if the car he hired was found with
his blood on the driver's seat...
So where is he?
Colombia. Colombia?!
Mr Ewart, of Janus Cars,
had a 20,000 Colombian peso note
in his wallet.
Quite a bit of change, too.
He told us he hadn't been abroad
recently,
but when I asked him about the cars,
I could see his tan line clearly.
No-one wears a shirt on a sun bed.
That, plus his arm. His arm?
He kept scratching it. Obviously
irritating him, and bleeding.
He'd recently had a booster jab. Hep-B, probably.
Hard to tell at that distance.
He's just back from settling Ian
Monkford into his new life in Colombia.
Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance,
and she splits it with Janus Cars.

Oh, yes. She's in on it too.
Go and arrest them, Inspector,

Would have bled a lot, right?
Yeah.
But the wound's clean.
Very clean, and fresh.
How long would the bacteria
have been incubating inside her?
Oh, eight, ten days.
The cut was made later.
After she was dead?
Must have been.
The only question is, how did the
tetanus enter the dead woman's system?
You want to help, right?
Of course.
Connie Prince's background - family
history, everything, get me data. Right.
There's something else that
we haven't thought of. Is there?
Yes. Why is he doing this -
the bomber?
If this woman's death was
suspicious, why point it up?
Good Samaritan.
Who press-gangs suicide bombers?
Bad Samaritan.
I'm...I'm serious, Sherlock.
Listen, I'm cutting you slack here,
I'm trusting you,
but out there somewhere, some
poor bastard's covered in Semtex
and he's just waiting for you to solve the puzzle,
so just tell me, what are we dealing with?
Something new.

I've seen her take girls who looked

Still, it's a relief, in a way, to know
that she's beyond this vale of tears.

Great.
Thank you. Thanks again.
It's a real shame. I liked her.
She taught you

Not until now.

Excuse us. What? Sherlock. What?
We've got deadlines.
But you've not taken anything!
WATSON LAUGHS
Yes! Ooh, yes!
You think it was the cat.
It wasn't the cat.
What? Yes. Yeah, it is. It must be.
It's how he got the tetanus into her system.
Its paws stink of disinfectant.
Lovely idea.
No, he coated it
onto the claws of her cat.
It's a new pet,
bound to be a bit jumpy around her.
A scratch is almost inevitable.
I thought of it when I saw the scratches on her arm,
but it's too random and clever for the brother.
He murdered his sister for her
money. Did he? Didn't he?
Nope. It was revenge.
Rev...? Who wanted revenge?
Raoul, the houseboy.
Kenny Prince was the butt
of his sister's jokes.
Virtual bullying campaign. Finally, he had enough,
fell out with her badly. It's all on the website.
She threatened to disinherit Kenny, Raoul had grown
accustomed to a certain lifestyle... Wait. Wait!
Wait a second. What about the
disinfectant on the cat's claws?
Raoul keeps a very clean house.
You came through the kitchen door,
saw the state of that floor -
scrubbed within an inch of its life.
You smell of disinfectant.
No, the cat doesn't come into it.
Raoul's internet records do, though.
I hope we can get a cab from here.
CLOCK TICKS
Raoul de Santos is your killer.
Kenny Prince's houseboy.
Second autopsy shows it wasn't
tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince,
it was botulinum toxin.
We've been here before.
Carl Powers. Tut-tut.
Our bomber's repeated himself.
So how'd he do it?
Botox injection. Botox?
Botox is a diluted form
of botulinum. Among other things,
Raoul de Santos was employed to give
Connie her regular facial injections.
My contact at the Home Office gave me the
complete records of Raoul's internet purchases.
He's been bulk-ordering Botox
for months.
Bided his time, then upped
the strength to a fatal dose.
Are you sure about this? I'm sure.
All right, my office.
Hey, Sherlock, how long? What?
How long have you known?
Well, this one was quite simple.
And the bomber repeated himself.
That was a mistake.
No, but Sherlock, the hostage, the old
woman, she's been there all this time!
I knew I could save her.
I also knew that the bomber had given us 12 hours.
I solved the case quickly, that gave
me time to get on with other things.
Don't you see? We're one up on him.

Although technically,
I did solve the case.
He killed the old lady

he put himself in the firing line.

Well, usually, he...
must stay above it all.
He organises these things,

Playing this game with you.
Do you think he wants to be caught?
I think he wants to be distracted.
Oh...
I hope you'll be
very happy together.
Sorry, what?
There are lives at stake, Sherlock.
Actual human lives! Just so I know,
do you care about that at all?
Will caring about them

Then I'll continue not to make that mistake.
And you find that easy, do you? Yes, very.

Do you reckon this is connected,

Must be. Odd, though,
he hasn't been in touch.
Then we must assume that some poor
bugger's primed to explode, yeah?
Yes.
Any ideas? Seven, so far.
Seven?
He's dead about 24 hours.
Maybe a bit longer. Did he drown?
Apparently not. Not enough of the
Thames in his lungs. Asphyxiated.
Yes, I'd agree.
There's quite a bit of bruising
around the nose and mouth.
More bruises...
here and here.
Fingertips.
He's late 30s, I'd say,
not in the best condition.
He's been in the river a long while, the
water's destroyed most of the data.
But I'll tell you one thing,
that lost Vermeer painting's a fake.
What?
We need to identify the corpse,
find out about his friends and...
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What
painting? What are you on about?
It's all over the place,
haven't you seen the posters?
Dutch old master, supposed to
have been destroyed centuries ago.
Now it's turned up,
worth Â£30 million.
OK, so what has that
got to do with the stiff?
Everything.
Have you ever heard of the Golem?
Golem?
It's a horror story, isn't it?
What are you saying?
Jewish folk story, a gigantic man made of
clay - it's also the name of an assassin.
Real name - Oskar Dzundza.
One of the deadliest assassins in the world.
That is his trademark style.
So this is a hit? Definitely.
The Golem squeezes the life out of
his victims with his bare hands.
But what has this got to do
with that painting? I don't see...
You do see, you just don't observe!
Yes, all right, all right, girls!
Calm down.
Sherlock, do you want to
take us through it?
What do we know about this corpse?
The killer's not left us with much,
just the shirt and the trousers.
They're pretty formal, maybe
he was going out for the night.
The trousers are heavy duty.
Polyester, nasty, same as the shirt, cheap.
They're both too big for him. So
some kind of standard-issue uniform.
Dressed for work, then.
What kind of work?
There's a hook on his belt...
for a walkie-talkie.
Tube driver?
Security guard? More likely.
That'll be borne out
by his backside. Backside?!
Flabby, you'd think he'd led
a sedentary life.
Yet the soles of his feet and the nascent
varicose veins in his legs show otherwise.
So, a lot of walking
and a lot of sitting around.
Security guard's looking good.
The watch helps too.
The alarm shows
he did regular night shifts.
Maybe he just set his alarm
like that the night before he died.
No, no, no. The buttons are stiff,
hardly touched.
He set his alarm like that a long
time ago, his routine never varied.
But there's something else. The
killer must have been interrupted,
otherwise he would have
stripped the corpse completely.
There was some kind of badge
or insignia on the shirt front
that he tore off, suggesting the dead
man works somewhere recognisable,
some kind of institution.
I found this
inside his trouser pockets.
Sodden by the river,
but still recognisably...
Tickets? Ticket stubs. He worked in a
museum or gallery. Did a quick check.
The Hickman Gallery has reported one of its
attendants as missing - Alex Woodbridge.
Tonight, they unveil
the rediscovered masterpiece.
Now, why would anyone
want to pay the Golem
to suffocate a perfectly ordinary
gallery attendant?
Inference, the dead man
knew something about it,
something that would stop the owner
getting paid Â£30 million.
The pictures are fake. Fantastic.
Meretricious. And a Happy New Year.
Poor sod.
I'd better get my feelers out
for this Golem character.
Pointless, you'll never find him,
but I know a man who can.
Who? Me.
Why hasn't he phoned?
He's broken his pattern. Why?
Waterloo Bridge.
Where now, the gallery?
In a bit.
The Hickman's contemporary art,
isn't it?
Why have they got hold
of an old master? Don't know.
Dangerous to jump to conclusions.
Need data...
Stop!
Can you wait here?
I won't be a moment.

Change? Any change?
What for? Cup of tea, of course.
Here you go, 50.
Thanks.
What are you doing? Investing.
Now we go to the gallery.
Have you got any cash?
No, I need you to find out all
you can about the gallery attendant.
Lestrade will give you the address.

never much of a one for hoovering.
What about art?
Did he know anything about that?
It was just a job, you know?
Mmm.

No.

Come on,

Missile defence plans
haven't left the country,
otherwise Mycroft's people
would have heard about it.
Despite what people think,
we do still have a secret service.
Yeah, I know, I've met them.
Which means whoever stole
the memory stick can't sell it
or doesn't know what to do with it.
My money's on the latter.
We're here.
Where?
Sherlock! What if there's
someone in?
There isn't.
WATSON: Jesus...
Where are we? Oh, sorry, didn't
I say? Joe Harrison's flat.
Joe...?
Brother of West's fiancee.
He stole the memory stick,
killed his prospective
brother-in-law.
Then why did he do it?
KEYS RATTLING
Let's ask him.
Don't! Don't.
He wasn't meant to...
What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.
Why did you kill him?
It was an accident. I swear it was.
But stealing the plans for the missile
defence program wasn't an accident, was it?
I started dealing drugs.
I mean, the bike thing's
a great cover, right?
I don't know how it started.
I just got out of my depth.
I owed people thousands.
Serious people.
Then at Westie's engagement do,
he starts talking about his job.
I mean, usually, he's so careful.
'But that night, after a few pints,
he really opened up.
'He told me about these
missile plans.
'Beyond top secret.
'He showed me the memory stick,
he waved it in front of me.'
You hear about these things
getting lost,
ending up on rubbish tips
and whatnot.
But there it was. And I thought...
'Well, I thought
it could be worth a fortune.
'It was pretty easy to get the thing
off him, he was so plastered.'
Next time I saw him,
'I could tell by the look on his
face that he knew.'
What are you doing here?
What have you done with the plans?
What happened?
'I was going to call an ambulance,
but it was too late.
'I just didn't have a clue what
to do. So I dragged him in 'ere.'
I just sat in the dark, thinking.
When a neat little idea
popped into your head.
Carrying Andrew West way away from here.
His body would have gone on for ages
if the train hadn't hit
a stretch of track that curved.
And points. Exactly.
Do you still have it, then -
the memory stick?
Fetch it for me,
if you wouldn't mind.

No, but I'm not the world's
only consulting detective.
True. I won't be in for tea.
I'm going to Sarah's. There's still some
of that risotto left in the fridge.
Milk, we need milk. I'll get some.
Really? Really.
And some beans, then? Mm.
DOOR CLOSES
FOOTSTEPS
Bought you a little
getting-to-know-you present.
That's what it's all been for,
isn't it?
All your little puzzles,
making me dance.
All to distract me from this.
Evening.
This is a turn-up, isn't it,
Sherlock?
John! What the hell...?
Bet you never saw this coming.
What...would you like me
to make him say...next?
Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear,
gottle o' gear. Stop it.
Nice touch, this. The pool,
where little Carl died.
I stopped him.
I can stop John Watson, too.
Stop his heart. Who are you?
DOOR OPENS
I gave you my number.
I thought you might call.
Is that a British Army Browning
L9A1 in your pocket,
or are you just pleased to see me?
Both.
Jim Moriarty. Hi.
Jim?
Jim from the hospital?
Oh, did I really make
such a fleeting impression?
But then, I suppose,
that was rather the point.
Don't be silly.
Someone else is holding the rifle.
I don't like getting my hands dirty.
I've given you a glimpse,
Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse
of what I've got going on
out there in the big bad world.
I'm a specialist, you see.
Like you.
Dear Jim...
..please will you fix it for me
to get rid of my lover's
nasty sister?
Dear Jim, please will you fix it for
me to disappear to South America?
Just so.
Consulting criminal.
Brilliant. Isn't it?
No-one ever gets to me.
And no-one ever will.
I did.
COCKS GUN
You've come the closest.
Now you're in my way.
Thank you.
Didn't mean it as a compliment.
Yes, you did. Yeah, OK, I did.
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.
SINGSONG
Daddy's had enough now.
I've shown you what I can do.
I cut loose all those people,
all those little problems,
even 30 million quid, just
to get you to come out and play.
So take this as a friendly
warning... my dear.
Back off.
Although I have loved this,
this little game of ours.
Playing Jim from IT. Playing gay.
Did you like the little touch with the underwear?
People have died.
That's what people do!
I will stop you. No, you won't.
Are you all right?
You can talk, Johnny boy.
Go ahead.
Take it. Mm? Oh...
..that? The missile plans.
Boring!
I could have got them anywhere.
Sherlock, run!
HE LAUGHS Good!
Very good.
If your sniper pulls that trigger,
Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.
Isn't he sweet? I can see
why you like having him around.
But then, people do get
so sentimental about their pets.
They're so touchingly loyal.
But oops!
You've rather shown
your hand there, Dr Watson.
Gotcha.
Westwood. Do you know what happens if you
don't leave me alone, Sherlock? To you?
Oh, let me guess. I get killed.
Kill you?
No, don't be obvious.
I mean, I'm going to kill you anyway, some day.
I don't want to rush it, though.
I'm saving it up for
something special.
No, no, no, no, no.
If you don't stop prying, I'll burn you.
I'll burn the heart out of you.
I have been reliably informed
that I don't have one.
But we both know that's not
quite true.
Well, I'd better be off.
Well, so nice to have had a
proper chat.
What if I was to shoot you now?
Right now?
Then you could cherish
the look of surprise on my face.
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.
Really, I would.
And just a teensy
bit...disappointed.
And of course, you wouldn't be able
to cherish it for very long.
Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.
Catch you...later.
No, you won't!
DOOR CLOSES
All right? Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Sherlock...
Sherlock!
HE GASPS
Oh, Christ.
Are you OK?
Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine.
That, er...thing that you...
that you did,
that, um...you offered to do...
that was, um...good.
I'm glad no-one saw that. Mm?
You ripping my clothes off
in a darkened swimming pool.
People might talk.
They do little else.
Oh...
Sorry, boys. I'm so changeable!
It is a weakness with me,
but to be fair to myself,
it is my only weakness.
You can't be allowed to continue.
You just can't.
I would try to convince you,
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.
Probably my answer has
crossed yours.
