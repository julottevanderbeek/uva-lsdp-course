This's how that works
Somebody from my side count the money
Then we call it the dope
And somebody from your side
Go looking the product
And what's rite here?
So, send somebody over
Can't find the shooter
Who's yours?
Rite here
And i brought your friend
She's mine now
...gave her to me
To ask questions and find
out interesting things
We've couple men
After where she and me go
You guys wanna see that?
Anyway, she's here now
To make sure everything is alrite
Still no shooter
Michael, show them the money
I don't want him
Why?
What difference does it make, Sonny?
Listen to me, asshole!
I don't want that motherfucker near me!
You send Isabella
Stay here
Let her go
Check the bill
Then come back
Come on
The container
Target number 2
Fire
Go!
Go!
No!
Who are you...?
Who are you?
Is he alrite?
Yeah, he's ok
What is this?
This's a house for you
A man named Frank is coming in a boat
And no one'll follow you
Including me
Remember
I said
Time is luck
Yeah
Stupid killers
Nurse?
The End
