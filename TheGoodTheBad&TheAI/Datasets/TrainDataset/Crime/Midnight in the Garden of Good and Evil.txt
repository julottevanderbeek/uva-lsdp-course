Quit eyeballing me, Flavius.
I knew you when you was
a two-bit hustler on Bull Street.
Excuse me!
Where can a fella get a cab?
He just left.
You can call the company, but I's you,
I'd wait on him to come back.
'Less you want to take a ride.
- You going to Jones Street?
- I'll get you there.
Put your stuff in there.
To your right. Pirate's House...
...built in 1794.
All the ne'er-do-wells and scalawags
divided up their booty there.
Sherman stayed
in the Green-Meldrim House...
...to rest up
after his fiery march through Atlanta.
He was going to burn Savannah...
...but the locals drowned him
in Chatham Artillery punch...
...and fancy parties
till he decided...
...to spare our fair city.
Forsyth Park. Ladies and gentlemen.
You looking for something?
No.
Mr. Kelso?
Are you Mr. Kelso?
I'm Lorene Baxter.
Welcome to Savannah.
Town & Country
is my favorite magazine.
Oh, my land, where are my manners?
What can I get you to drink?
Anything cold would be great.
Mr. Williams restored this home.
One of the many he saved
from the wrecking ball.
The carriage house is reserved
for Jim's clients...
...and guests, such as yourself.
He's here.
Welcome, Mr. Kelsy.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kelso?
- John Kelso.
Yes. I'm Betty Harty.
Sonny's been expecting you.
I'm here to see Jim Williams.
Sonny's Jim's attorney.
Well, hell...
...come on in, coach.
John Kelso.
Welcome to the old curiosity shop.
Take a seat.
You let me know.
- How was your trip?
- Fine. Mr. Williams said...
He will be right along. We have
a little business to attend to first.
Confidentiality agreement.
Just boilerplate stuff.
Plus a paragraph...
...outlining Jim's editorial privileges.
Town & Country flew me down to write
a 500-word story on a Christmas party.
It's a literary postcard.
Are you serious about this?
It's not just any party.
Have you asked the magazine?
I'd rather have your word
than some New York lawyer.
Be that as it may...
...I'm not going to sign that.
Damn! How come?
It's just a little old party write-up.
All the more reason
not to compromise my ethics.
As a professional,
I'm sure you understand.
Promise to be fair?
Yes, of course.
Jim...
...this is John Kelso.
Hello.
Let's take a walk,
shall we, sport?
We'll go around Forsyth Park.
Would y'all mind...?
Not at all, Betty.
Come on.
Did you sign Sonny's papers?
Actually, no.
Good for you. Sonny's
overly protective of my interests.
- Still walking the dog, Mr. Glover?
- Yes, sir.
Patrick do love his morning walk.
Would you mind? Could I please have
my picture made with Uga?
Great.
Thanks.
All right. Smile.
Thanks. Dang good dog.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for asking.
No matter what you and I ever do
in our lives, Mr. Kelso...
...neither of us
will be as famous as Uga.
He's the university mascot.
- "The Georgia Bulldog."
- Is that right?
I know I'm going to regret asking,
but that man said he was walking a dog.
What dog?
Mr. Glover was the law firm porter.
Mr. Bouhan said in his will that
Mr. Glover should continue to be paid...
...$ 15 every week for walking Patrick,
his Labrador.
So...
...where's Patrick?
Patrick went on to his great rewards
- The dog's dead.
- Quite.
Why doesn't Mr. Glover walk Uga?
Well, then, who'd walk Patrick?
I see.
- There it is.
- This is your house?
Built by General Hugh Mercer in 1860,
but he never lived in this house.
His great-grandson was Johnny Mercer.
The songwriter?
Savannah's own.
What's your favorite of his tunes?
My mother was always partial
to "Fools Rush In."
Your mother.
Indeed.
I'd love to give you the grand tour, but
they're still setting up for the party.
I thought the party was tomorrow night.
There are two parties.
Tonight is for bachelors.
Gentlemen only.
Would you like to come?
I'd like to cover it.
I'm sorry. It's private.
Reporters aren't allowed.
Would you like to see my shop?
It's back here in the carriage house.
This house is one of the largest
in Savannah. It covers an entire block.
It's right in here.
This is where we do all of our...
...restorations.
This landscape, is it a Stubbs?
Very good.
My father was a dealer.
It's called Newmarket Heath
with a Rubbing-Down House.
It's a recent purchase I will unveil
at tomorrow night's event.
It's an odd piece.
The impasto is interesting.
Where's your black light?
It's an overpaint.
Very good, sport.
- You had it x-rayed yet?
- No.
How will you know
what it's obscuring?
I rather enjoy not knowing.
Just a minute.
- Who is it?
- Mandy.
Who?
I don't know a Mandy.
Of course not.
You won't open the damn door.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
You all got some ice?
Sure, help yourself.
Joe Odom's fridge is on the blink.
And plus, at present...
...we don't have electricity.
Thirsty?
Me? No.
No, not really.
If you're thirsty, a drink'll cure it.
If you're not, a drink'll prevent it.
Prevention is better than a cure.
Put on some pants, John Kelso.
Sure, just let me get a pair.
This is our newest addition
to the Odom House.
As you see, Joe's been creative
with our electrical dilemma.
I done this before
and I ain't never been killed yet.
But there's a first time for everything.
There we go!
We got it!
No problem.
Joe Odom?
The one, the only.
Where's my libation?
Hold these.
To Savannah Electric and Power!
And let's not forget our friends...
...the...
...whoever!
Here's to you!
All right, inside.
Honey, that's a tough job,
but you're talking to the lady. Hello!
Have you met Mr. Kelso,
our newest addition to Savannah?
Jerry Spence.
- How are you?
- I'm charmed now.
- How are you?
- I'm pretty good.
- I wonder if he goes to my church?
- I wonder.
Episcopalian.
We'll find out.
Sanitation
I see all night long
Hauling in great big cans
I'm hoping one day soon
She'll let me be a Hefty man
In the Dumpster
We'll be making love
In the Dumpster
Beneath the stars above
In the Dumpster
I smell paradise
Don 't have to ask me twice
It's all I'm thinking of
Just me and that trash girl
Making that Dumpster love
Do you like that?
Strong.
Strong and good.
Chatham Artillery punch.
What's in it?
Whatever's available on both counts.
Great party. Great house.
The fella that owns it is in Europe
for a year. Asked me to look in on it.
Water the plants.
Squatting?
That's a vicious word.
You're not a lawyer, are you?
Good. They're the scum of the earth.
And I should know...
...being an ex-barrister myself.
Ex?
Ceremoniously disbarred
not two years ago.
Had a little accounting snafu.
What do you do now?
Me and Mandy,
we're going to open a piano bar.
You already have one.
Looks that way, doesn't it?
Wait a minute. Hold the music.
Look.
Look at this.
Jerry Spence.
You have outdone yourself again.
That is a coif definitely befitting
your stature as the future ex...
...Mrs. Joe Odom.
Keep dreaming, darling.
You're in love.
She is one beautiful woman.
You two engaged?
Not yet.
It's getting late. I'm going to
hit the road. Nice meeting you.
No, wait a minute.
Joe's rule #2:
If you have to leave a party,
you always take a traveler.
I can live with that one.
Nice to meet you.
Hey, there.
Better to be on the edge of a party,
don't you think?
Thanks for inviting me.
Anytime.
Every time.
Earlier...
...how'd you know my name?
Welcome to Savannah.
Mr. John Kelso?
This is for you.
I'm not in. Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.
- Mr. Kelso?
- Yes.
I'm Lucille Wright.
I cater Mr. Williams' parties.
- Nice to meet you.
- He'll be down shortly.
Would you like to see what we'll serve?
Of course.
Come in.
Lots of fresh vegetables...
...hot bread...
...jumbo shrimp.
Let's see.
This is smoked ham and turkey.
Both.
A big fruit platter.
And this is a wonderful crab dish.
A bisque?
Jeff Braswell.
- I shoot Jim's parties.
- Let's get a shot of the whole spread.
Town & Country
loves its pretty pictures.
And pumpkin cornbread.
Mr. Williams insists on
low-country cooking for his parties.
Oh, you're going to have fun tonight.
Indeed he is, Lucille.
Good fit. 44 long.
I have an eye for framing things.
Welcome to Mercer House, Mr. Kelso.
You have outdone yourself again
this year.
Well, thank you.
I'm glad to see you.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
There you are. The man with the cigar.
So happy you're back.
Emma.
Did you watch my drink for me?
Merry Christmas.
I thought you'd tried
to steal it from me.
- Senator, how are you?
- Great.
Merry Christmas to you.
So happy to have you here.
Look at you.
Welcome to Mercer House.
I think we have
quite a party going tonight.
Look at that niece of mine.
Come over here.
- How are you?
- John Kelso.
Oh, darling!
You look so pretty tonight.
I have one just like that at home.
I see our emerald bird has arrived.
Good to see you.
Handsome as ever.
- How are you, dear?
- I'm just fine.
Now who is that magnificent creature?
That is Serena Dawes.
Serena, you are
as gorgeous as ever.
I try.
Celebrated beauty in her day.
When her tycoon husband died, she
moved back to Savannah and created...
...sort of a museum to herself
in her boudoir.
I'll introduce you.
- You look very nice.
- Who are these people?
How lovely to see you out of bed.
Why, Jim,
I'd get out of bed for you anytime.
Harry was just about to show us
the latest addition to his arsenal.
You know what that is?
That is a.25.
My late husband blew his brains out
with one of those.
- So did mine.
- What?
I was fixing myself a drink and Gunsmoke
was on TV and I heard a shot.
I thought it was part of the show till
I walked in and Lyman was bleeding...
...sprawled in his favorite chair.
Everyone knew
our marriage was a disaster.
If I'd so much as touched that gun,
they'd have charged me with murder.
Yes, well, one day...
...I will shoot a man.
I may start with you. Or you.
- Is that loaded?
- Oh, yeah.
Which conversation shall we join?
The one least likely to involve gunfire.
Excuse me for a moment.
That's from Napoleon's
coronation carriage.
You have an impressive collection.
No, Mr. Kelso. Look around.
It's not a collection, it's my home.
- Fabergé?
- I'm a minor enthusiast.
Minor? Three eggs...
...a jewelry box and, I believe,
a gold-leaf album.
Nicholas himself would be lucky
to have so much Fabergé.
Wouldn't he?
I admit to that.
Would you care
to see something a little more...
...unusual?
That'd be very nice.
Hello, Mother, darling.
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- I'm having a wonderful time.
John Kelso.
He's a writer, Mother.
This is what we call the ballroom.
Is this the prized relic?
It's a very rare relic.
This is the dagger
that Prince Yussopov used...
...to murder Rasputin.
He sliced off
his cock and balls with it.
True story...
...and deliciously evil,
don't you think?
Delicious.
German Luger?
Be careful, it's loaded.
We've had burglaries.
Everybody's got loaded guns around here.
So tell me.
Has your family always collected?
That's a very genteel way of asking
if I come from old money.
- Do you?
- No.
I was born in Gordon, Georgia,
a little town outside of Macon.
My father was a barber,
sometime house builder.
My mother was a secretary.
What money I have is about 11 years old.
So, yes, I am...
...nouveau riche.
But then it's the riche that counts.
There's only 2 things
that interest me...
...work...
...and those trappings of aristocracy
that I find worthwhile.
The very things they're forced to sell
when the money runs out.
And it always runs out.
And then all they're left with...
...is their lovely manners.
Fuck you, goddamn bitch!
Wouldn't even let me in the house.
Had to come in the servants' entrance.
Excuse me for a minute?
We agreed you'd stay away tonight.
Don't give me that drag-ass shit.
I got stood up tonight, I'm pissed off.
Give me $20.
You get paid on Friday
like everyone else.
Give me $20.
- I need it to get fucked up, is what.
- You've accomplished that, sport.
Give me the money.
I ain't even close to getting fucked up
the way I want to get.
I'm not going to give you money
for liquor or marijuana...
...or whatever else you've invited...
Fuck you, Jim!
You don't give me warnings! I give them
to you! I can back mine up.
And you, you piece of shit!
You better watch yourself.
Fuck you.
That's Billy Hanson.
He works part-time in the shop...
...and can, on occasion,
be a very colorful character.
I don't know who hates me more,
the Atwells or their dogs.
Lon Atwell's been upset with me since I
had him removed from the museum board.
There's only one way to remedy this.
Thank you, Senator.
It was a hell of a bash, Jim.
- You've outdone yourself.
- Delightful.
We thoroughly enjoyed it.
Thanks for having us.
This...
You have my book.
You seem surprised.
It didn't exactly
fly off the bookshelves.
What a coincidence,
that I'd be assigned...
...to this story
and you'd have read my only book.
There are no coincidences.
Have you ever written
for Town & Country before?
No.
You requested me?
They've wanted to cover
my Christmas party for years.
My acceptance of their offer this year
was contingent on one thing:
Your participation.
Thank you for that.
No, thank you.
Now sit back, relax, enjoy your brandy
and tell me your life story, John Kelso.
It's getting late
and I have an early flight...
...so maybe I can take
a rain check on that. Next Christmas.
If you make the cut.
We'll hope for the best.
I can't wait to see the article,
and I hope you have enough...
...for your 500-word essay.
Believe me, I could use 10,000.
Thanks for everything.
I'll show myself out.
Oh, and sport...
...I really did like your book.
Thank you.
That's a beautiful jacket.
I believe it's an endangered species.
Look at that 14-karat gold dress
and Tony Manero.
Who's hungry?
Want some punch, baby?
Oh, that's such a good pony.
What are you doing,
getting that horse drunk?
What happened?
That Jim Williams
went and shot somebody.
Canapé?
What?
He sure did. Those lights
ain't part of the Christmas display.
For real?
Yes, sir. He shot somebody.
Look at that man go.
I'm starting to like that Yankee.
What's that saying?
Curiosity killed the Yankee? That's it.
He was drunker when he got back,
and I'll tell you...
...when he's been drinking,
he's got another personality altogether.
He'd already smashed things upstairs
earlier.
And he must've gone
to some drive-in B movie...
...with throats being slashed.
No doubt it had an effect,
because I've never seen him that angry.
He and I got into an argument.
He destroyed this beautiful,
priceless antique clock in the hallway.
If you'd like to...
...spike that up...
...the bar's in the living room.
No, thank you.
I'm still on duty.
I know that.
I'm sorry.
This is very upsetting.
How much longer
is this going to take?
What are you doing here?
I work for the city, too.
I got the film from that party.
I'll get it to you.
Great, great.
He came into the office
and he stood there and he yelled...
..."I might be leaving tomorrow, but
goddamn it, you're leaving tonight."
Then he fired at me twice and I pulled
the Luger from my desk and fired back.
If it had happened to you,
you would've done exactly what I did.
I have never been so scared in my life.
If I had not shot at Billy...
...I have no doubt it'd be my obituary
you'd be reading tomorrow.
- What're you doing here?
- The thing was open.
Jesus Christ, Frank!
My client has nothing to say.
I can't believe you would do this
without calling me!
How long have we known each other?!
Is this entrapment, Frank?
What the hell is going on?
Sorry, I'm not going to have time
to process this.
Film from the party.
Jim told me
you heard Hanson threaten him.
No-good street hustler.
I told Jim he was dangerous.
Forget about Town & Country.
I know I've been here only 3 days and
it's just a shooting, but give it time.
This place is fantastic. It's like
Gone With the Wind on mescaline.
I know you're my agent.
Listen to me.
They walk imaginary pets here
on a fucking leash, okay?
They're all heavily armed and drunk.
New York is boring.
I'll call you later.
Finley Largent's up for reelection,
so he'll try to get this to trial.
He won't take my damn phone calls...
...so we'll have to use the back door.
I'll be back.
Thanks for coming over, coach.
Jim's in the office.
We talked about something
we'd like to run by you.
You want me to kill the story.
Done.
Great, great.
Why?
Actually, I was...
...considering...
...writing a book.
Sweet Jesus. A book about what?
Self-defense happens all the time.
Then why are you worried about the D.A.?
I overheard in the lobby.
We're a small town.
We defend ourselves, our reputations...
...against the outside world.
Word gets around a New Yorker's
trying to make us look bad...
...you'll find Savannahians
can get tight-lipped.
If there's a trial, will I be a witness?
You threatening me?
Absolutely not.
You perjure yourself,
you'll find yourself in jail.
I wouldn't do it. When it comes
to this, I'm at ground zero.
If there's nothing worth writing...
...then you got no worries.
That's what I get paid for.
I will not permit this.
I don't need anyone's permission.
Not really.
Then why are you soliciting it?
You need my permission...
...my help...
...my acquiescence...
...or you don't have a story.
Not really.
We both know that.
So would the river flow both ways?
Meaning?
Would you share whatever information
you garner with me and Sonny?
Yes, but it won't change what I write.
And you don't get to see a word of it
until it's published.
So...
...who'd be the main character
in this book?
Have you written up cases
like this before?
A few of them for Esquire. Yeah.
What do you think?
What do I think?
If you're worried about the D.A.,
grand juries read papers.
Proper spin control
could make a big difference.
What the hell are you talking about?
You said Hanson was a street hustler.
Did he have a record?
Take drugs?
Deal drugs? Pimp?
That kind of spin
can influence a grand jury.
Get investigators to hit the streets.
Every P.I. In town's an off-duty cop.
Besides, why would we need a P. I...
...when we got ourselves
a hotshot New York writer...
...filling all the gaps?
Take care, bubba.
- Are you the flower man?
- No, I'm John Kelso.
Good morning, I'm a writer
and wanted to ask you...
If you're not the flower man,
leave me be.
The Lady's in mourning, and
I haven't received a flower or a rose...
...or anything to show for it.
Please leave me be.
I know Billy Hanson used to live here.
I wanted to ask a few questions.
And if it's an inappropriate time,
I'll come back later.
I can't believe you're running around
ringing my doorbell. Where you from?
Where are your manners?
Just leave me be.
My condolences.
I'll call...
I'll come back another time, or...
I apologize for the delay.
Why, thank you. They're lovely.
They're absolutely lovely.
I'd love to ask you a few questions,
if you have a minute.
Is this your car?
How about a ride home?
Thank you.
What I want to know is,
what is a white boy like you...
...doing driving a big old brother's
jive-ass heap like this shit here?
I just bought this.
I kind of like it. It's not a bad car.
No, it's not bad.
Did I hurt your feelings?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
I can't help it.
I just call things out as I see it.
I just can't help it.
I just do that.
- One thing you needn't worry about.
- What's that?
Ain't nobody going to try
to steal this piece of shit.
I'm just practicing up till I can save
enough money to get my Rolls.
Chablis is a pretty name.
It's unusual.
Thank you. I got it off a wine bottle.
It's a show name.
- You're an actress?
- I'm not an actress. I'm a showgirl.
I work at the Pick-Up on Congress.
I lip-synch, I emcee, I dance.
You know, shit like that.
The person you see now
is just little old simple Chablis.
But in the evenings...
...when I put on my gowns
and my makeup...
...and my jewelry and my perfume...
...I become "The Lady Chablis."
You are just so cute.
A cool white wine for a cool black girl.
And you're full of flattery too.
It's getting hot up in here, honey.
My shots are kicking in.
Excuse me?
Yes, honey, my shots.
Never mind that.
What'd you want to talk to me about?
Billy Hanson.
No. Billy's dead.
Case closed.
Was he your boyfriend?
Billy, my boyfriend?
Were you two lovers?
No. Hell, no.
Billy was way too trashy for me, honey.
I'm a lady.
However, he did date
my roommate Corinne for a while.
The two of those
had some wild times together.
- Those are beautiful.
- So, tell me more about Corinne.
Corinne's like a lot of girls.
She found herself attracted
to the wrong type of man.
Billy was not the right type of man.
She thought she could change him.
But there was no way of changing
that evil son of a bitch.
- I'd love to speak to Corinne.
- I'd like to too.
But she skipped town
owing me two months' rent.
And Billy said he would pay for it,
but now he's...
But you know...
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
But you know,
it's like my mama always said...
..."Two tears in a bucket...
...motherfuck it."
I have to remember that one.
Don't remember that one.
That's off-the-record.
Let me get your door for you.
Thank you, hon.
In the phone book,
you were listed as F. De Veau.
What's the "F" stand for?
The "F" stands for Frank, hon.
That's me.
- She's a he.
- Correct.
You're shitting me.
If this thing heats up,
I think you'll want to talk to her.
Proper folks don't discuss such things.
She paints a rotten picture of Billy.
Let me tell you a story.
There was a judge here years ago.
His oldest boy was messing around
with a gangster's girlfriend.
One morning they found him...
...lying under the porch
with his privates tucked into his lapel.
Dead men tell no tales.
Next day, headline read...
..."Fall From Porch Proves Fatal."
Some fall.
What's your point?
Saving face in the light of unpleasant
circumstances is the Savannah way.
I'll try to track down that real girl.
Corinne, you said?
Well, I got to skedaddle.
Doing Christmas at Tybee Island.
We got all sorts of folks coming.
Have a great Christmas.
- You too, John.
- See you later, Uga.
Merry Christmas!
He's got it on a string!
Luther's not eating!
Check, please.
You didn't like it?
No, they were very good.
Excellent.
What was in the vial?
He says it's enough poison
to kill everybody in the county.
If he eats and it's a good day...
...fine.
If he doesn't eat...
...let's put it this way: If I were
you, I wouldn't drink the water today.
Where does he put the poison?
In the water supply system.
Is that true?
Do you believe that?
I've lived here a long time, honey.
I believe most anything about anybody.
Where are we going?
Patience, dear boy.
It's time you meet the most important
member of my defense team.
We're going to the cemetery?
Not Bonaventure.
The colored cemetery's down the road.
Looks like we got the garden
all to ourselves tonight.
Meet Minerva.
How do you do?
You trying to work me, boy?
Put that hand back in your pocket.
I feel sorry for you.
Do tell, Minerva.
He think nobody love him.
That's silly.
We've never met.
You got a hole in you.
Too many questions.
Don't know whether to be this way
or that without the answers.
There ain't no answers.
You come a long way to find that out,
didn't you?
Now we got to get to work.
You bring the money?
Put it on the grave.
Kiss it first,
so it come back to you.
You bring the shiny dimes?
Bury them.
He's working hard against you, James.
Who? Dr. Buzzard?
The boy. The dead boy.
Oh, Billy.
That doesn't surprise us.
Dr. Buzzard?
Ain't got much dead time left.
Dead time?
Lasts an hour.
Half-hour before midnight
till half past.
Half-hour before midnight
for working good.
Half-hour after for evil.
We'll need a little of both tonight.
You got the bottle of water?
Ain't been through no pipe?
Give it to me.
We got to make him...
...Ioosen up on James.
I need Shango...
...and a little hungan.
Come.
Come!
Tell me something about him.
He tried to kill me?
No, before then.
Something good.
Your kind words...
...take root, flower,
come back to bless you.
Something that made him happy?
His Camaro.
He loved his Camaro.
He wouldn't let anyone near it.
That car was his pride and joy.
Keep talking. It's working.
It's working!
He spray painted it flat black.
You should've seen him.
He spent hours on that car, fixing it...
...cleaning it.
He painted racing stripes on it...
...and all kinds of other things.
He was very creative.
That's something
most people didn't know.
He was an artist.
Just now,
when you were saying them things...
...I felt him ease off.
He heard you say you love him.
That's preposterous.
He tried to kill me.
He was working against you,
and now I know why.
He wants you to tell the whole world
you hated him.
Maybe they think you hated him
enough to kill him.
If you do that, you go to jail...
...and he know that.
Most important thing:
You got to beg that boy's forgiveness
each and every day.
Time for evil.
Quick, quick.
Tell me his name.
Finley Largent.
When you get home, write his name
Connect all the names into one.
Dot no I's, cross no T's.
Fold it twice and put it in your pocket.
Get a picture.
Sew up the mouth with dove's blood.
Blacken the eyes.
Now go!
I got works to do.
Boy!
Take these words to heart.
To understand the living...
...you got to commune with the dead.
Now go!
And don't you dare look back!
On the grave...
Who is Dr. Buzzard?
Minerva was married to Dr. Buzzard...
...the foremost voodoo practitioner
in Beaufort County.
You may not know it,
but you are deep in voodoo country.
I don't believe
in the hocus-pocus of it...
...but the spiritual force behind it.
The shiny dimes were easy...
...but the virgin water
was a trick or two.
How do you know she wouldn't know
the difference if it was tap water?
Not by looking or taste...
...but she would've known
in an instant by looking at my face.
I think...
...the photo-doctoring
is going to be good therapy.
What about the pleas
for daily forgiveness?
No, I don't think that's
going to be happening. Definitely not.
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.
- Hey, you.
- How are you?
- How you doing?
- Good.
You work here?
What you see is what you get.
Nothing wrong with that.
Gee, thanks.
These are nice.
You want to send some flowers?
I think so.
I don't know, though.
It's kind of complicated.
For whom?
What's she like?
I don't know her that well.
Roses are a favorite.
A bit presumptuous.
How about...
...poinsettias?
Perennials might
give the wrong impression.
- Too long-term?
- Yeah, it's hard to say.
This is complicated.
How about petunias?
They're pretty without
being presumptuous, smell nice...
...and in 3 days you throw them out.
Sound like what you're looking for?
Sorry, we're all out of petunias.
Come on, get up, Lewis.
Get up.
Get on up.
Good afternoon, Yankee John.
That sounds like a dead battery.
Woman that owns the tour company
rear-ended me...
...so to speak.
Where we headed?
How about live entertainment?
Get on up, Lewis.
That's a good horse.
Hey. Bitch!
Hey, bitch!
Let the house say it like you mean it.
Let the house say, "Hey, bitch!"
Hey, bitch!
Yes, I am a bitch,
and proud of it, honey.
Your mama is just sweating. I'm putting
a sweating in front of you white folks.
But then again, I want you all to know
how hard a girl is working for you.
Excuse me, darling.
Excuse me.
Oh, my God!
"Oh, my God," nothing, honey.
"Oh, my empress" is what you should say.
Y'all been necking
since I walked out on stage.
Look, our lvory Soap-using girl.
Love them kind of bitches, baby.
Either he got some good old stuff,
girl, or you horny as hell.
Is this your boyfriend?
Your husband?
My husband.
What does Mr. Man do for a living?
He's a doctor.
A doctor?
You better grow you some nails, because
if he's a gynecologist, he's mine.
I am serious, honey.
He is mine. A doctor. Grow your nails,
I'm going to take him away from you.
Look at him just blushing.
You're so cute.
You want to give me a physical?
I have nothing to hide.
You better have American Express, baby.
But you know what?
That's okay about him.
Because the Doll has already got
some white boy...
...running after her good old stuff.
Spotlight, shine a spotlight over there.
Right over there.
You see that fine white man right there?
That one, there.
He has been running the Doll
all around Savannah trying to get some.
First day I met him,
he brought the girl roses.
Then again, as you well know...
...ain't nothing too good for the Doll.
Ain't nothing too good for the Lady.
I am serious about that.
If I catch any of you bitches
near him, honey...
...I want you to know you'll have
to deal with the Lady Chablis...
...the Doll, the Grand Empress,
and my motherfucking ice pick.
So keep your hands off of that one.
Hey, honey love.
How are you, Doll?
I'm fine.
Who is that handsome man?
Joe Odom.
Pleased to meet you.
My pleasure. We met before.
We slept together one night.
Narrow it down for the Doll. There are
certain nights I cannot remember.
That's another tale for another time.
My ice cubes are getting a bit dry.
I'll leave you two alone. Ma'am.
Thank you. I'll talk to you later,
you sentimental gentleman.
Hurry back.
Don't let him hurry back.
I need to spend time with you.
How are you?
I'm fine, honey. Still hiding my candy.
Want me to unwrap it for you?
- You don't have to.
- You sure?
Not yet.
I mean, not ever.
- It's a small little wrapper.
- Please.
Like a Tootsie Roll.
Some people don't need to see candy.
Okay, that's fine.
But I got something to tell you.
I got something to tell you.
I have boyfriend number four.
Really?
A tall, blond hunk of a hunk of man.
He's a mechanic on Abercorn Street.
Know where that is?
- I know where that is.
- Treats me like a queen.
No pun intended.
None whatsoever.
You must promise if you
ever meet him, which I doubt you will...
...if you should meet him,
you must never tell him my "T."
- He has no idea.
- Your "T"?
You know, my "T," my truth.
The hide-my-candy thing.
He doesn't know,
so you mustn't say anything.
- Promise me you won't.
- Don't you think he'll find out?
When I'm ready for him to find out,
he'll find out.
Like when I was ready for you
to find out.
But I wasn't looking for your candy.
But you was smelling for it.
- I did not smell your candy.
- Why are you here?
I want to interview you.
Your show was terrific.
Thank you.
You want to interview me?
Yes, very much so.
What happened?
They're trying to put our friend away
for life.
Your Honor...
...the community that put us both
in the positions we now hold...
...would be less than pleased with
an order allowing a wealthy defendant...
...in a first-degree murder case bail.
And they'd be right.
All right, gentlemen.
I have listened carefully
to these arguments.
Mr. Williams is charged
with a very violent crime...
...and Mr. Seiler, I can't grant bail
under these circumstances.
But I will put this case
on a fast track...
...for a speedy trial.
That's all.
Well, sport, looks like there might be
a book in this after all.
Does he have any idea
how serious this is?
You know it and I know it...
...and after tonight,
damn hell, so will he.
What is it?
You told Sonny I heard Billy
threaten you the night you shot him.
I heard you threaten him too.
If I testify...
I didn't threaten him.
I warned him.
He had a history of violence.
He was drunk and high.
While trespassing,
he profanely demanded money...
...and brandished
a broken bottle in my face.
Is that not your recollection as well?
- More or less.
- Then your testimony can only help me.
What was it between the two of you?
We'll turn this off.
I don't mind that.
Was it just sex?
Tell me about the relationship.
Billy and I had a bond.
That's not something
they're going to understand.
They'll just see the sex...
...and the age difference.
But Billy was going to make something
of himself.
Great things, great people...
...can come from humble beginnings.
He needed what I gave him...
...and I needed what he gave me.
Now, do you wish
to pass judgement on that?
No.
I'm innocent, John.
It's important that you believe that.
Do you believe that?
Yes, I do.
I'm having trouble
getting anyone to talk to me.
I'll make some arrangements.
Tomorrow, can you bring the Sotheby's
and Christie's catalogues?
They serve dinner here at 7,
so that's when we'll make our calls.
Our calls?
Yes, accept the charges, operator.
Jim. How are you?
All right, sport,
let's give this a try, shall we?
Let's see if we can work this.
All right, it's ringing.
Hello, Jim Williams calling
for Geza von Habsburg.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Geza.
James! How nice of you to call.
Would you be interested
in my Maximilian desk?
Someone, ask him to be quiet.
It sounds like your dog
doesn't want to sell. What's his breed?
That's a Russian wolfhound.
Sounds more like a Shar-Pei.
No, no, that's my Yorkie.
Would someone please
put the dogs in the garden?
I'll take care of the dog for you.
Now, Geza,
you know I'll want top dollar.
As always.
Shut up!
Is this the Married Women's Card Club?
Yes.
Is anyone going to ring the doorbell?
Oh, heavens, no!
We have very strict rules.
The door opens precisely at 4.
You all look lovely.
Actually, Jim...
...suggested
that I introduce you around.
But if we could just keep that
between us...
- Why?
- Just a minute.
Everything all right, ladies?
Good.
Jim was a true friend to me
over the years.
But most of these ladies
are still deciding...
...how they'll respond
to this current predicament.
You know...
...the incident.
I have work to do in the kitchen.
Would you like to take a seat?
- I don't play bridge.
- Oh, I don't mean play.
Men aren't allowed.
Especially single men.
But you could sit down and wait.
I'll be right back.
It was a crime passionnel.
A lover's quarrel.
That may be, but I gather
it's going to be rather sticky for Jim.
Really?
There's no gunpowder on that boy's hand.
He didn't fire the gun...
...as Jim claims.
And the location
of the bullet wounds...
Seems to be at odds with
Mr. Williams' scenario of self-defense.
How so?
One entered the chest. The second
bullet hit the boy in the back.
And the third, well,
the third bullet...
What do you think'll happen to Jim?
It's difficult to say.
Those who are happy Billy is no longer
burning rubber through the squares...
...are the exact people who think...
...that Jim picked a very unseemly way
to exit the closet...
...if you will.
With a bang.
Literally.
And then...
...there are the others.
Tell me about the others.
There's bound to be a certain
resentment about Jim killing that boy.
That boy in particular, I mean.
Why?
Billy was a very accomplished hustler.
By all accounts,
very good at his trade...
...and very much appreciated
by both men and women.
The trouble is...
...he hadn't finished
making the rounds, no.
Billy Hanson was known to be...
...a good time...
...but...
...a good time not yet had by all.
They're saying Jim Williams killed
the best piece of ass in Savannah.
- Is that true?
- I don't know.
You know about ass in Savannah.
What do you think?
Great God!
Good gossip's hard currency in this
town. Folks just paying their bills.
When the chips are down,
they'll be there for Jim. Trust me.
- Rather hear your legal strategies.
- Our game plan's still percolating.
We had a deal.
I've shared every bit of information...
Come along in.
Now, don't mind us.
Trial date.
Big game 3 weeks from now.
It's a shootout.
Both teams got one silver bullet.
Gunshot residue test, that's theirs.
No gunshot residue on Billy's hands
means he didn't fire.
