What do you think of all this,
Miss Lake?
Well, for civic reasons,

For personal reasons,
I hope Lee wins

I hope you both look good
with your shirts off
Papa?

Wheres your sketchpad?
I was never any good
Ended up with a Masters

Educations
an expensive habit
Lee paid for it
He shouldnt have

I asked him to
Besides, police work

Do you have a girlfriend,
Dwight?

BUCkY: So he quits

puts you through school
Quite a guy

All right, easy
Guys, guys
Dont trample over everything,
please
Secure the area
All right, listen up
No reporters view the body
You photo men, finish
taking your pictures now
Coroners men,
put a sheet on the body
as soon as they are done
We set up a perimeter
six feet back
Any reporter crosses it,
arrest him
Now, gentlemen, before
this gets out of hand,
lets put the kibosh
on something
With publicity,
you get confessions
With confessions,
you get crazies,
liars and false leads
So, we keep some things quiet
The ear-to-ear
facial lacerations,
disembowelment,
you keep this information
to yourselves
Not your wives,
not your girlfriends,
no other officers,
and I mean no
Bleichert, what the hell
are you doing here?
Where the hells Blanchard?
He
Nash might be renting a room
in that building over there
I heard something
on the radio about
a shooting
Was that Nash?
No
We had some trouble
Stand back!
Get back of the line!
Move back
Get them back!
Hey, Eaymond Nash, remember?
We need to go

I know hes an old beef

But he doesnt
want to talk about it
and he gets out in a week
You know who he is?
I
I
You don
Were supposed to be
looking for Nash
Priority
Yeah, priority
for Homicide Division, not us
Nice white girl gets snuffed
Got to show the voters
they did the right thing
passing the bond issue
It
We don
Maybe she wasnt
such a nice girl
Maybe that old lady
that Nash snuffed was
somebody
Maybe we let
the Bureau handle this
and we get back to our job
before Nash snuffs
somebody else
Got any other maybes?
Yeah, maybe weve had
enough headlines
With or without you, Buck
With or without you
Therefore, we have created
a special unit
which will include a number
of highly trained officers
including
Detective Eussell Millard,
our very own Mr Fire
and his partner, Mr
FEMALE EEPOETEE:
Mr Loew, can you assure
the public that you will find
the murderer
before he strikes again?
I can guarantee you
this killer will be caught
You got us detached?
Slow and easy, Buck
I gave Loew a memo saying
Nash blew our jurisdiction
You did what?
Are you fucking nuts?

The APB still stands
He
This is the main event
Nash is pure undercard
Just give me another week

Through and through

of both mouth corners
No visible bruising
on the neck
Eectangular abrasions
on the wing tips
of the sphenoid bones
And, oh!
A puncture wound, here,
in the palm
On the palm of the right hand

no free-flowing blood
Intestines, stomach,
spleen, liver, all removed
Is it all right to smoke,
Doctor?
She won
Lower half of cadaver
reveals removal
of all reproductive organs
Both legs broken at the knee
Questions
Whats your best guess?
Well, heret,
she wasnt raped
and she wasn
In terms of the nitty-gritty,
the cause of death
is either the mouth wound here
or she was beaten to death
with something like
a baseball bat
What about her insides?
They came out posthumously
I say then he drained
the blood from the body
and washed it clean,
probably in a bathtub
Have you got a name yet?
Date of birth,
July 29, 1924,
Cops popped her in

Detective Bleichert,
Mr
This is Detective Blanchard
We would like to
express our condolences

Neither of youd have lasted

Mr Short?
Betty came west in 43,
stars in her eyes
I promised her three squares
and a five-spot,
she kept the house tidy
She live with you then?
I gave her the boot in July
Moved to Santa Barbara
Sent me a postcard
a couple weeks later
Some soldier
beat her up pretty bad
Thats the last
I heard from her
WAITEESS: I need three pigs
in a blanket
Keep your fucking panties on
Was that soldier
her boyfriend, Mr Short?
Boyfriend?
They were all her boyfriends
As long as they wore
a uniform
See, Betty believed in
quantity before quality
LEE: You calling your
own daughter a tramp?
I got five daughters
One rotten apple ain
Well, maybe this time
she had a boyfriend
Maybe
Any names, Mr Short?
Look, Tom, Dick, Harry,

But Im holding this suitcase

Miss Short moved around

All right
How about the world
of high finance?
How about the movies?
You girls are all trying
to break in, right?

Congratulations
How about Betty?
Maybe once
Maybe not at all
She came around
last Christmas,
bragging about
getting her big break
Guess after all
those screen tests,
she finally got a part
But,
she had a tendency to
Stretch the truth?
No
She fucking lied
Do you know the names
of any of her boyfriends?
What is it?
You can tell me
Well,
I do remember,
before she split,
her and Lorna
Mertz?
Yeah
I mean I dont want to
tell any tales out of school
but I do remember them being
up on Hollywood Boulevard

And she,
she was wearing a mans suit
and had a man
But it was just that once
Miss Saddon,
are you saying they
were talking to a lesbian?
Your driver

On a conversational level,
they were right up there

Cute

Sure
My family and I were in Laguna

DeWitt gets out tomorrow,
Lee
I was thinking maybe
I should talk to him

Lee
MILLAED: All right, people,

Yeah, it
I heard it
Look, I didnt know
you were a boxer
Daddys heard of you
and he insists

I told him
we met at that art exhibit
at Stanley Eose
So, if you have
to pump everybody
for my alibi, be subtle
BUCkY: Whos this?
Balto
The paper is the
for August 1, 1926
Balto was bringing in
the paper
when Daddy found out
he made his first million
He wanted to consecrate
the moment,
so he shot him
Here we go
Mother, Father,

Bucky, this is my mother,
Eamona Cathcan't Linscott
BUCkY: Nice to meet you
MADELEINE: My father,
Emmett Linscott
BUCkY: Pleasure to meet you,

And my sister,
Martha McConville Linscott

Too bad
He shamed his family
And speaking of families,
Eamona, Martha
Thats our best Glenlivet,
laddie
Madeleine says nice things
about you
Daddy,
can we eat?
Bucky and I want
to catch a 9:30 show
Of course, darling
Dig in, lad
Hearty fare breeds
hearty people
Haute cuisine breeds
degenerates
I want to draw
Mr
Youre in for
a cruel caricaturing, Bucky
Maddys my pretty one,
but Marthas
my certified genius
What kind of a name
is Bleichert? Dutch?
German
A great people, the Germans
Hitler was a bit excessive
But mark my words
that someday well regret
not joining forces with him
to fight the Eeds
You know,
I killed a lot of your
countrymen during the war
Mr Bleichert, have you
met Balto in the hallway?
Yes
EMMETT: An old friend
stuffed him
We were in the Scots Eegiment
together
He wanted to work
in the flickers
When did you move here?
Hollywood was a cow pasture
but the silent flickers
were booming
Georgie got work
as a lighting man,
me building houses
Georgie introduced me
to Mack Sennett
I helped him build
that housing project
he was putting up
underneath
that god-awful sign
Hollywoodland
I used to love
the
Me, too
Old Mack knew how
to squeeze a dollar dry
He had extras moonlighting
as laborers and vice versa
Georgie and I used to drive
them over to Hollywoodland
after 12 hours
on a silent flicker
Then put in another six hours
by torchlight
He even gave us movie credits
a couple of times
EMMETT: Mother
Are you feeling well?
Would you like to contribute
to the conversation?
Did you know, Mr Bleichert,
that Eamona Boulevard
is named after me?
I didn
When Emmett married me,
for my fathers money,
he promised my family
that he would use
his influence
with the City Zoning Board
to have a street named
after me
But all he could manage
was a dead-end block
in a red-light district
in Lincoln Heights
Are you familiar with
the neighborhood,
Mr Bleichert?
I grew up there
Yes, well,
then youll know
that Mexican prostitutes
expose themselves
in windows
I hear many of them
know Mr
Thats enough!
I will sing for my supper
when Mayor Bowron comes
to dinner,
but not
for Madeleine
He
My God, Emmett!
How little you think of me
I
I
Mr
BUCkY: You kept your name
out of the papers
Until the wedding
Your mother would love that
She
The kind who takes pills
the doctor gives her
so she doesnt have to admit
to being a hophead
Do you want to know a secret?
Sure
Daddy bought
rotten lumber
and old movie sets
from Mack Sennett
and built houses
out of them
Thats how he really made
his money
Hes got firetraps
all over L
His good friend Georgie,
maimed in a car crash,
while running Daddy
some errands
And now he throws him scraps,
odd jobs, tending
Daddy
You dont have
to tell me this
I like you, Bucky
I didnt tell you
all about Betty
You didnt?
Don
Last summer, I heard about
a girl who looked like me
I got curious
I left notes
at a couple of places,
Your look-alike
wants to meet you,
things like that
I left my number
She called
Thats how I met her
at LaVerne
And thats all of it?
Yes
Tell me something
Whyd you want to meet
Betty Short anyway?
Ive worked hard to be loose
but the way people
described Betty
it was like she was a natural
Miss!
MAN: Get your hands off her!
Im an emancipated minor
and if you touch me
without a matron present
Ill sue you!
MAN: Leave her alone
No!
I
You and Betty made
the casting rounds
together, right?
Did you ever get
any movie work?
No
Well, then,
what about the film can?
It
What kind of movie?
Something tells me
it
Now, you have to tell us
the whole thing, sweetheart,
so think it through
I was cadging
at a bar in Gardena
This man started
talking to me
I thought I was pregnant
and I was desperate
wicked bad for money
He said hed give me $200
to act in a nudie film
He said he needed another
girl, so I called Betty
We made
the movie at this big house
a couple of hours
outside town
Then he drove us
back to L
Where was this house,
exactly?
I was pretty out of it,
if you know what I mean
What do you think, Euss?
This got anything to do
with the girls murder?
Long shot, Chief
Whats that about, gentlemen?
Your boy cant hold his water?
I got you Warrants
Youre my men
and you made me
look like a fool
in front of
the most powerful
man in the department
And you
Yeah, you
Blanchard? Look at me!
If you weren Fire,
you would be suspended
from duty already
Youre a punch-drunk,
washed-up fighter
Stay out of this, Bleichert!
Youre back on Warrants
as of tomorrow
I want you to report to me
at 0800
with a letter of apology
for Chief Green
You are a political animal,
and for the sake
of your pension,
I suggest that you grovel
It is now 8:15
in the morning
Wheres your partner?
I don
I was hoping he
Well, it is 8:15
and he is not here
and neither
are his letters of apology
Bleichert,
get out of my sight
Blanchard!
He
No
For messing up Nash
Not good enough
I
Not good enough
I
Oh, fuck, Lee! Fuck!
Smile at me
Look soft and sweet
I picked up
Lorna Mertz yesterday
She had a copy
of a stag film,
her and Betty Short
playing les
Pretty spooky stuff
Did she mention me?
No
And I checked
the case file
No mention of that
number-leaving note
thing that you did
Listen,
Im withholding evidence
for you
Its a fair trade
but it shakes me
Are you sure
there isnt anything
you havent told me
about you and Betty?
Betty and I made love once,
that one time last summer
I just did it to see
what it would be like
to do it with someone
who looked like me
Jesus Christ
Bucky, that
Bucky, please stay
You stupid slut
Stay Sugar, stay!
Hey
We
Notorious
Wheres Lee?
Bobby DeWitts
probably in L
Lee always said I
You will be
He had a sister
What?
He had a little sister
She was killed
when Lee was 15,
and they never
caught the guy
Why
Why didnt you tell me
this before?
He made me promise
never to tell you
He thought it made him
too easy to figure
Well, it sure explains
some things
No, it doesn
Kay, wheres Lee?
If you know,
you should tell me
Kay,
Bobby DeWitt just got out
Lees all hopped up
on Benzedrine,
so what do you
think is going to happen?
Where is he?
Morrie Friedman called
a couple of hours ago
The guy from New Years?
Bobbys got a drug deal
somewhere
in a building Friedman owns,
the Olympic, I think
When?
Now
Jesus
Dwight
Bobby DeWitt?
Get your hands up
Get up against that wall
over there
Keep your hands
where I can see them
Jesus
I ain
Youre here for a drug deal
with Morrie Friedman
I know that
Look, Im just looking
for a place to take a piss
Lee Blanchard
Did you know that?
Blanchard?
Man-oh-Manischewitz,
I aint seen Blanchard
since my fucking trial
Yeah,
but he
And you
Im thinking that you let
the word out there knowing
he
Look, maybe
I flapped my trap at trial
Maybe I was thinking revenge,
maybe talking trash
to my cellies,
but all I know is
what I read in the papers,
and when that fucker
killed them niggers
Finish up
I dont know
what his version is
Whats your version?
Sir, all this between
me and Blanchard
is that I fucked this
big-tittied Dakota cunt
named kay Lake
MAN: Hold it, pal
Blanchard, behind you!
BUCkY: Blanchard!
No!
Here
My apologies,
Officer Bleichert
My men are instructed
not to take any chances,
and you did have a gun
The guy
with the choke rope,
I assume DeWitt brought him
for muscle
No identification,
nothing left of his face
after he hit the fountain
You understand why we must
handle things like this, huh?
It
Uh-huh
Come on
Get him in here
Officer?
See what we got here?
I cant think of another way,
can you?
Come here
Come on
Come
Want to say something?
Fire and Ice
Fire and Ice
FEIEDMAN: Excuse me?
Nothing
Just do it quick
What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
How long have you known
about this?
I don
Why show me now?
I don
Hes not coming back,
is he, Buck?
Stupid son of a bitch,
getting himself killed
over a little mope
like Bobby DeWitt
Damn
Did you tell kay?
Well, thats as far
as it goes, then
Mo Friedman was right
Our boy doesnt need
any more headlines
Neither does kay
This
I want you to
stick with me here
We are going to make
something of this
Im collating the kA update
sheets for tomorrow
Anything new
you need him to add?
No
Dolphs tonight?
I
Wednesday nights
were the nights shed make
Lee and me a big dinner, so
We haven
We
Should we say something?
We haven
To my supercops
I feel like I havent said
anything right
Haven
There
There is
There is
He saved my life
He saved my life,
and I saw him there
and I couldn
Dwight
I couldn
I couldn
I didn
I never move
I
Kay, I
I
I could
I could
I cut my foot
on a bathroom tile
You got it in you
to replace a few?
Yeah, of course
Dwight
Dwight
Id always wondered
where he kept it
Were you ever
going to tell me?
Hed given all his money
to Ben Siegel and he
He wanted to buy us a home
I didnt know
there was any left
Were you ever
going to tell me?
Something
Bobby did do
the bank job, Dwight
Don
I dont know
what kind of idea
I got right now
Things were getting really
bad between me and Bobby,
and I had to get out
I knew this guy that Bobby
made me be with once
He was a hophead
who let it slip
that he sometimes snitched
to the cops for dope money
And thats how you met Lee?
I told him what Bobby was
doing to me, how he cut me
and pimped me to his friends
and I told him about
the bank job and where
Bobby was hiding the money
And then last year,
the guy
The hophead?
Yeah
Lee had given him $1,000
for introducing us
He found out
that Bobby was getting out,
and he threatened to tell him
that we stole from him
He wanted money that
we didn
He wanted $10,000
What were we going to do?
Promise me, promise me
youll forgive him
for DeWitt
Forgive him
for the bank
It doesn
What was the guys name?
It doesn
Kay, tell me the guy
It was Baxter Fitch
KAY: Youre so good
at some things
Dwight, he loved you
He loved both of us,
Dwight, so much
This had nothing
to do with us, Dwight!
Nothing! Dont run out on us!
Family
But you know that
You
What?
Nothing
You miss them?
Mothers insults?
Marthas pornography?
I just never imagined
Georgie so
The way your father
described him
Different
They were young
He died last year
Daddy paid to have him
buried at the family plot
in Scotland
That
BUCkY: I don
I doubt modern art
gets you, either
But I do
Kay, what the hell
are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
How could you?
How could you?
You follow me here,
after what youve done?
What have I done? Nothing!
You lied to me!
I lied for you!
I lied for us!
What could I do but lie,
Dwight?
You could have
told me the truth
She looks like
that dead girl!
How sick are you?
Youre going to end up
like Lee
But I will not
MADELEINE: I dont
want to go to Europe
EMMETT: One of my foremen
said the goddamn pipes
are spewing gas
There
Its about time I showed
the three of you good old
Scotland
I dont want to go
to Europe, Daddy
Youre always talking
about how dreadful
and provincial it is
Yeah, but its got
what you need, lassie
What is that, Emmett?
Saps like me?
Or is that what you needed?
Oh, laddie
You killed Elizabeth Short,
and the two of you
covered it up
You made that stag film
with Lorna and Betty
I
I found it all
Put that gun down, laddie
Youre not the shooting type
and I
You might be half right
Jesus Christ, Bleichert
That
Great
Let
I
I
So you dont
like my taste in art
I dont think
that
Stop! Georgie did it!
Oh, that
Blame it on the poor,
dead gardener
No, Bucky
Believe him
Georgie was always sneaking
around Daddy
He saw them make the movie
and he got crazy about Betty
More
There are so many
pretty things here, Emmett
All right
Betty called,
short of cash, as usual
I put Daddy on
and he offered her money
to date a nice man he knew
You mustve known
he was a sick fuck then
Well, he was passive
I mean, he liked
to touch dead things
I mean,
his father was a surgeon
Did you know that?
Famous in Scotland
We didnt know
he
EAMONA: Liar!
Liar!
You did him enough damage,
Emmett Now you let him go!
I would appreciate it
if you just stopped shooting
things, Officer, though
The rich dont own art
just for themselves
We safe keep it
for future generations
How did Emmett damage Georgie?
What did he do
to make him go so crazy?
Who made what made who crazy?
It was Madeleine
She was 11 years old,
and she looked
just like Georgie
Eamona!
Shut up, Emmett!
That
George and me
Not that Emmett cared
about that
But he was her father
And for that,
he ruined George
When he got out of hospital,
I gave him the Hugo book
as a present
He had worked construction
on that movie with Emmett
It was always
one of his favorites
That
My picture
What about Betty Short?
Well, that was
the cruelest joke of all
He was obsessed with her,
you know, that filthy film!
Hes a shy wee lad,
but l
Itd make him very happy,
I think, if youd take him
out on a wee date
Oh, gosh
It was the second swing,
woke her up
We
You know that
Over what? Some little slut?
Hello, Officer Bleichert
Did you come to pay your
respects or fuck my sister?
I came to talk to you
about Lee Blanchard
He came here, didnt he?
Asking about your sister
and the Dahlia?
Tell me
yourself back
to the Halls of Tripoli,
shitbird
Ive got business
with the lady
Bucky
Lee knew everything about you
and Elizabeth Short
He knew everything,
didnt he?
I dont know
what you
I went by your house today
I talked to your sister,
Martha
She told me that a policeman
named Lee Blanchard came by
the house
asking questions about
you and Elizabeth Short
She told him that
the two of you were close
Martha was always
jealous of me
He was blackmailing
your father
No
For messing up Nash
So,
on the night that
he went to the Olympic
to settle an old score
Ive been pointing my gun
at a lot of people this week
I havent had a chance
to shoot anybody yet
What do you think?
I think youd rather fuck me
than kill me,
but you dont have
the guts to do either
You
You
Of my partner
A murderer?
Of Lee Blanchard?
You should thank me
for Lee Blanchard
If it werent for me,
you wouldnt
have had the balls
to fuck your partner
You dont talk
about them, okay?
Wait
You dont fuck her anymore
because youd rather
fuck me
You don
You chose me over her
You
He was going to take
Daddys money and leave,
leave all of you
You
Don
Because that girl,
that sad, dead bitch,
she
No
Come inside
