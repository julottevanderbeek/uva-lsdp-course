Ah.
Nice of you to show up,
Pokey.
Yeah, sorry I'm late.
Had traffic on the 50.
Looks like the coroner's
finishing up.
- Talk to him, see what he's got.
- The traffic got lipstick on you.
What? Where?
Hope she gave you breakfast.
Forensics ate all the bagels.
Late and later.
What's your excuse?
It's all a journey, Lisbon.
She washed up here
sometime last night.
A jogger found her this morning,
called it in.
The only identifiable mark
is that tattoo.
Coroner says she was strangled
before she hit the water.
Some tissue
under her fingernails.
Might've scratched the killer.
No sign of sexual assault.
Lisbon.
Yeah?
Check between her toes.
Why?
Because
I don't really want to.
Needle marks.
She was an addict?
Manicure but no pedicure.
Didn't want people
to see her feet.
The track marks don't
seem fresh. Maybe she got clean.
As soon as the M.E.
identifies her,
I want you to go and see
if she has any drug arrests
and check out
the local rehab centers.
Yeah, you got it.
Yeah?
Mr. Jane,
this is Agent Vint Molinari,
missing persons.
I'm on the Kristina Frye case.
An old client of Frye's
was listening to
some psychic call-in show
on the radio the other day,
heard somebody she swears
was Kristina.
We've got a recording
of the show.
Can you tell me
if this is her voice?
I spoke to the last
and wants her daughter to know
It's her.
Did you trace the call?
Comes from a landline,
house on Dellmore Road,
North of Femont Landing.
I'll let you know
if we find anything there.
4972 West 21st Street,
number 3.
I need an escort
for 148 North St. Andrews.
Unit 14, clear.
Jane.
How you doing?
== sync, corrected by  ==
Blood on the wall--
D.N.A. analysis says
it's Frye's.
And the house was clean.
No prints or trace evidence
of any kind.
No sign of a body
or a grave.
She's alive.
If he killed her, he would've
left her body out on display.
Vint, it looks like this is
more than just
a missing persons case to me.
I'm gonna talk to
the head of the division
and ask him to
hand the case over to us.
Why? Because it's Red John,
you're the Red John guys?
I've read his file, too.
Frye's been missing
for four months.
Red John never kept a victim
alive for more than a few days.
He never left
a-a clue on the scene
except
for the--the painted face.
And that call Frye made--
that's hardly a cry for help.
What's your point?
Well, who knows if Red John
had anything to do with this?
As far as I know,
Frye painted the face herself.
Why would she do that?
Well, the woman thinks
she talks to the dead.
She's half a nutcase
walking out the door.
Lisbon, I-I agree
with Agent Molinari.
Kristina's case should remain
in his capable hands.
Let's, uh, not get in the way.
I don't understand.
You don't want the case?
So what are you doing?
Nothing.
Why don't we just skip the part
where you lie to me
and get right to the part
where you tell me
what you're gonna do?
Red John let Kristina make
a call that could be traced.
He's playing a game.
With who?
See you later.
Yeah, that sounds great.
I can make it there by 7:00.
Listen, I have to go. I'll speak
to you later, okay? Bye.
If you're seeing traffic
on the 50 tonight,
you think she could set
her alarm a little earlier?
Okay, look, I get it.
This is, uh,
it's the last time you have
to hear about my love life.
I don't care
about your love life.
Just don't let it
affect the job.
My love life is not gonna affect--
Hey.
Hey, boss.
Anything on the girl in the River?
Name's Celia Jovanovich.
Some convictions for
narcotics possession. No family.
What about the rehab angle?
No mention of a program
in her record.
Well, she must've cleaned up somehow.
No arrests in almost two years.
Hey, that tattoo on our vic?
It's worn by members
of Visualize.
Visualize? The cult?
They do work with addicts.
She could've cleaned up there.
See? The wings form a "v" for "Visualize."
Yeah.
What was the name
of the guy who runs it?
Stiles. Bret Stiles.
Agent Lisbon,
I'm brother Steven Wench.
Mr. Jane...
Mm?
This is Warner Vander Hoek,
our Chief of Security.
Julius Coles, our attorney.
How do you do, Agent?
Quite an impressive file
at CBI, Lisbon.
I know if anyone can find
Celia's killer, you can.
I appreciate your confidence,
Mr. Vander Hoek.
How did you read my file?
I spent 11 years
working Seattle Homicide,
seven years
in the Intelligence Division.
Ooh. That's a whole lot of cop
for a self-help group.
We have enemies.
As Mr. Stiles says,
the truth always does.
Where is, uh, Bret?
I'm afraid brother Stiles
is busy with church business
at the moment.
And why are you so afraid?
It's a figure of speech?
Yes, it is. Shall we?
Yes, we should.
Lead the way.
Our addiction counselors
found her literally
living in the streets.
She attempted suicide
three times.
They...
They brought her here, and...
This is what she became.
Well, she certainly became
better at doing her makeup.
Your low personal opinion
of Visualize
is duly noted...
But irrelevant.
Let's try and confine
our discussion to the facts.
Of course. Uh, Mr. Coles, you're
not a member here, are you?
I am not.
Mm. That's interesting
that Mr. Stiles would hire
a lawyer outside
of the sacred fold. Hmm?
Oh,
what did Celia do here?
She worked
in our security section.
It's called vigilance.
We provide personal security
for the church's senior leaders.
I was her, uh, supervisor.
What's her home address?
She lived here. We provide homes
for members who want them.
Celia had had it tough.
The--the church was her haven.
And we're gonna need to speak
to all of her friends,
acquaintances, coworkers.
That'll be fine, with the proviso
that I or one of my associates
be present at all times.
Was there anybody in particular
that she was close to?
There was a fiancé,
David Herren.
He's a member of the church,
but I don't know
where he is right now.
Huh.
I'm sure you'll be able
to locate him for us.
Agent, I assume you will be looking
at suspects  the church.
I'd hate to think that this was
some sort of witch hunt.
Oh, we'll go wherever
the investigation leads us.
So, um, thank you very much.
Okay.
Uh, excuse me.
Hmm?
Uh, Tec-- interesting name.
Yeah. Yeah.
You look like an honest young man.
Do you know where brother Stiles
is right now?
No, sir, I don't.
Very honest. Terrible liar.
Is--is he this way?
Oh. Uh...
Or is he this way? Okay.
Sir, I-I don't think that--
uh, sir?
Yeah, spit it out.
I-I don't understand what you're doing.
You don't want to tell me
where Stiles is,
so when I move you in his
location, you react negatively.
I'm just reading
your negative reaction.
Well, please stop.
You're gonna get me in trouble.
This way?
Please don't go in there,
sir.
Thank you.
Oh.
You see,
if the mind is free,
there's nothing
that you can't achieve.
Because then the mind
has no limits.
I-it's a spaceship
with the power to travel across
all six dimensions,
journeying off to--
excuse me, uh, Bret?
I have a question.
What?
Sorry. Did somebody speak?
Uh, it--it was me.
Oh.
Patrick?
Yeah.
How nice to see you.
Why offer
only six dimensions?
Is--is it to hold off a couple
of dimensions to sell later?
I think six is quite enough.
When did you last see
Celia Jovanovich?
Oh, uh, Celia.
Yes, um, let me think. Um...
I believe she worked
a security detail for me
earlier in the week--
a seminar for premembers
at the Hyatt.
Premembers?
Those that have not yet seen
the truth.
You would be a premember.
Poor Celia.
It's tragic.
Uh, she fought so hard
for her sobriety.
When did you learn
of her death?
Well, I don't know.
I suppose
when they identified the body.
You know, many policemen
are Visualize members.
What do you think
happened to her?
No idea.
You have a theory?
Oh, no.
I never theorize.
We gurus must
speak the truth
or... nothing.
You were surprised
I was here about Celia.
Why did you think
I was here?
Kristina Frye, of course.
Kristina Frye?
Red John has her, right?
It's a terrible thing.
First your wife and child,
now miss Frye.
Sounds like he's jealous,
Patrick.
It sounds like
he wants to take away
everything
and everyone
that you care about.
It's a form of love,
you know.
What do you know about
Kristina Frye and Red John?
Patrick, I like you.
I like your vim.
And Red John--
he seems to be a perfectly
unpleasant sort of fellow.
If I knew how to get you even
a step closer to him,
I would cross desert wastes
to tell you.
But I don't know.
Ah,Starsky and Hutch.
Thank goodness.
Mr. Jane might have cut me
into small cubes by now.
God is in your mind,
right here.
All you have to do to see him
is clear out the bad energy.
I'll repeat the question.
Have you seen Celia Jovanovich
in the past 48 hours?
I've been visiting my mother
in Chino.
I got back this morning.
That's all I need. Thanks.
Aren't you interested
in the path to spiritual clarity
and personal freedom?
No.
How's it goin'?
Well, Celia was nice,
and a good team member,
and joining Visualize is a good
idea. That's it, pretty much.
Keep trying. You seen Jane?
Yeah, he's upstairs.
Vander Hoek took him upstairs
to see Celia's room.
Is he okay?
I guess. Why?
Nothing. Stiles just seems
to get to him a little bit.
That's a neat trick.
Yeah, I wish he'd teach it to me.
I got the fiancé's details.
David Herren works
at a restaurant downtown.
Go talk to him.
Okay.
You--come on. Let's talk.
Before we do,
can I just ask,
are you happy in your lives?
Sit down.
This was Celia's room.
Thank you.
David Herren?
Yeah.
Wayne Rigsby, CBI.
I need to, uh, talk to you
about Celia Jovanovich.
Yeah, yeah.
Listen, the thing is I--
one moment, David.
Hi. I'm Julius Coles,
David's attorney.
Wow. You guys are organized.
"Us guys"? Feels prejudicial.
You have a problem with
constitutional rights?
No, sir.
I was a mess
when I heard the news.
But I remember
what Mr. Stiles says--
clarify the mind with
discipline, order, work.
Are you the Head Chef?
Prep chef now.
Maybe more than that someday.
How long had you been
engaged to Celia?
A couple of weeks.
And how long had you known her before?
I didn't... know her.
I mean--
I don't understand.
I had
never seen her before.
High level Visualize members
often opt for what are called
designed marriages.
The partners are matched for, uh...
Energy consilience.
So it was an arranged marriage?
A rational marriage.
I knew the minute I saw Celia
we belonged together.
Was there someone else? Someone
angry about being replaced?
An ex-boyfriend perhaps?
Absolutely not.
How can you be so certain?
You only just met her.
Knowledge comes to those
who are open to it, Agent.
I knew Celia.
There was no one else.
Are you sure?
Because Celia was strangled.
That's a killer who's upset,
really wants to hurt the victim.
There wasn't anybody who might
have been mad at you and Celia,
might have made  mad?
There's no need to answer that.
I'm just trying to get
the picture here.
No, you're poking at him
with wild conjecture
to see how he reacts,
and I won't have it.
This is over.
So I checked into Herren.
Cooking's just a hobby.
His family's loaded--
old lumber money.
When he turns 27,
he inherits $10 million.
That's probably why
Stiles arranged the marriage.
With Celia married to Herren, the church
is more likely to tap into the money.
Yeah, but it's not motive
for Herren to kill Celia.
Oh, was there anything else from
the interviews at Visualize?
Nothing useful.
They all seem so happy.
I mean, truly happy.
Yeah. It's creepy.
Jane. Kinda lost track of you
at Visualize.
Took a nap.
Is something on your mind?
No, no.
Um, I'm gonna be upstairs.
Uh...
Celia had some problems
with Visualize philosophy--
questions,
issues with the dogma.
She, uh, might have wanted
to talk to someone about it.
Someone outside of the church.
Someone mentioned a friend of
hers who was a member but left.
Um... Lucy Joel.
Are you  nobody was
following you, saw you come in?
Lucy, nobody followed us.
I'm not crazy, okay?
I have been followed
and threatened.
Visualize doesn't like
when people leave the hive.
When you're a member,
every week you sit down
in front of a camera and lay out
every bad thing you've done.
I mean,
It's called ventilation.
Your vent vids.
It's supposed to air you out.
It makes you feel great,
clean.
Then when you're leaving,
they say, "whoa. We know
all this nasty stuff.
You're not gonna say anything
bad about Visualize, are you""
We're not here to get dirt
on Visualize.
We wanna talk about Celia.
Yeah.
She was sweet,
almost too nice, you know?
She needed people
a little too much.
She knew Visualize was crazy,
but they'd gotten her clean.
Ugh. And she was scared
to leave, you know?
Thought she'd start using
again.
Was she in touch with you?
She'd call, just to talk,
bitch about the church,
you know, stuff.
Was there anything specific
on her mind?
I-I can't. I'm sorry.
I don't want any trouble.
Lucy, listen.
We can offer you--
no. L--it was really hard
to leave that place.
Now I'm good with the church,
and the church is good with me.
Everything's good.
Listen,
I know you're scared,
but right now
you're Celia's guardian,
the only one
that can help her.
It's up to you.
She was having an affair with
somebody very big in the church.
She wouldn't tell me his name.
Then she was
supposed to marry Herren.
And he was sweet,
kept saying he loved her.
She felt bad lying to him.
Last time I talked to her,
she said
she had to do something,
but she didn't say what.
And if anybody finds out
I told you that,
I am  dead.
You were great in there.
"You're Celia's guardian."
It was nice.
I lied this morning.
I do care that
you're seeing someone else.
It hurts a little.
I mean, it's no biggie.
I'll get over it.
I want us to be friends.
We can get to that point,
right?
Can we be just friends?
Yeah. Sure, we can.
Good. I'd like that.
Behind us.
Huh?
Someone's tailing us.
Visualize?
Oh, yeah.
I guess Lucy isn't crazy.
Getting the plates.
Should I pull 'em over?
Can you get behind 'em?
Throw a loop? Easy. Watch.
Grace!
Grace!
Ohh.Hh.
You okay? You okay?
Yeah, yeah. You?
Yeah.
I just-- I just need a minute.
Can you go check on the other guys?
Mm.
Hey. CBI. You wanna tell me
what the hell you're doing?
FBI. I could ask you
the same thing.
Agent O'laughlin, is it?
Craig O'laughlin.
That's right, ma'am.
You wanna tell me why the FBI
was tailing two of my agents?
Sure. We've been looking
at Bret Stiles and Visualize
for a couple years now.
And we've had allegations
of tax fraud, racketeering,
and a lot worse,
but we haven't gotten our hands
on anybody that could tell us
about the organization.
Tight as a drum.
Yeah, but why follow us?
My boss thinks Stiles may have
people inside law enforcement,
which would explain why we're not
getting anywhere with the investigation.
Y-you think that we're working
with Visualize?
She wanted us to look into
the possibility. That's all.
And I've seen
no evidence of it.
What you did was reckless.
I should bring you up
for departmental discipline.
But  shouldn't have been
following you,
so I'm gonna let it pass.
And you tell your boss
if she wants to catch bad guys,
she should follow bad guys.
It was a pleasure
working with the FBI.
Hey, listen. I'm sorry
about that. Does it hurt?
No. No, it's not that bad.
Thanks.
You know,
Van Pelt...
Mm-hmm.
You--you related
to Amos Van Pelt, by any chance,
the foot-football coach
at Burton?
He's my father.
Whoa. Uh, he was
one hell of a coach.
I was a wide receiver
at U. of M.
Your, uh, your dad gave us
one tough game.
O'laughlin...
Didn't you go NFL? Tennessee.
I did, yeah.
Yeah, just a couple of years.
Thanks for remembering.
Anyway, I should get back
to the office,
get beat up by my own boss.
You see your dad,
tell him he's remembered.
I will. Thanks.
Yeah.
Hey. Excuse me.
You're the FBI guy, right?
I'm a special Agent in charge,
if that's what you mean.
Now, that's exactly
what I mean.
So you guys are
investigating Visualize
and this character
Bret Stiles, right?
I guess that's
common knowledge by now.
Yeah.
Do you have a guy deep inside
the church, you know, un-undercover Agent?
You can't seriously
be asking me that.
So that's a "yes."
Any chance of a name?
No. No chance.
We have to get back
to Visualize.
Why is that?
Celia Jovanovich was almost
certainly killed by her lover,
so she almost certainly
mentioned his name
in her vent video.
Ergo, we need
to see her videos.
I'll get my coat.
What do you have in there?
Oh, look at that.
Thank you.
"To make ourselves
fully conscious,
"the challenge is
to expand the power of mind
"by dispelling doubt and guilt
so that we may find in our--"
Sorry. Didn't mean
to startle anyone.
Well, actually, I did.
You got a minute?
What is it, Mr. Jane?
You're the FBI's
undercover Agent, right?
What?
I need a favor.
Just a small one.
Get rid of 'em.
Guys, take a break.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Well, when I just
popped the bag right now,
your hand went for your hip.
You were reaching
for your gun.
It's a cop instinct.
Never goes away.
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?
This is
an ongoing investigation,
and I spent three years working
my way into this organization.
Hey, don't freak out, Serpico.
I need one little thing.
Forget it.
Your investigation is dead.
If I picked you out, then Stiles
has definitely picked you out.
The only reason he hasn't
gotten rid of you is because
he's using you. He's feeding you
false information.
Do you have
any usable evidence?
No. Didn't think so.
And you never will.
You can help me, though.
Together, we can catch
Celia Jovanovich's killer.
What's this about?
I need to see
one of her vent videos,
and I need you to take me
to where they're kept.
Get a warrant.
Warrants take time.
And meanwhile,
back at the ranch,
they're wiping the tapes.
The room
where they're stored
is full
of security cameras.
They'll be on to you
in minutes.
Yes, they will.
That's what
I'm talking about. Let's go.
Ah, Agent Lisbon.
What's all this about
you wanting Celia's vent videos?
We believe Celia Jovanovich
may have identified her killer
in one of the videos.
We'd like to take a look
at 'em.
No, no, no. That's impossible.
The ventilations show
our members
at their most vulnerable.
Only senior members
of the church
are allowed to see them.
I mean,
I could no more show you them
than a priest could discuss
a confession. Hmm?
Now if you'll please
excuse me...
Sir?
Yeah.
Security feed
of Patrick Jane.
What?
Agent, this is
a security camera feed
from our video room.
What's going on?
It's been about half an hour.
This is outrageous.
I'm getting bored.
Mr. Stiles is calling in
every important person he knows
to try and get us fired.
It takes time.
Ah.
You're done.
You are done.
We've spoken
to your superiors,
explained to them that
we view Mr. Jane's actions
as a grievous breach
of civil liberties.
We'll be pursuing civil
and criminal remedies.
Meh.
I'm curious.
You couldn't hope to watch these
videos for any length of time.
What did you think
you'd accomplish by coming here?
Oh, we'll see the videos.
Oh, you  see them, will you?
And--and how is that?
You'll give them to us.
Oh, really? And why? Why?
Celia Jovanovich
was killed by her lover--
someone very high up
in your church,
someone that is very probably
in this room right now.
Well, that's very interesting,
if it were true.
And I daresay, is mentioned
in her videos.
So if you say
you'll give us the videos,
the killer
will identify himself.
He will be the man
that insists most forcefully
that you shouldn't give 'em
to us.
What if I killed her?
You?
You wouldn't hurt a fly.
Patrick has offered
a very, um,
persuasive argument.
I'm going to be handing over
the videos to him.
No.
No. Absolutely n--
I-I can't allow that.
Why not?
The precedent
would be unacceptable.
It would--
it would open up all manner
of intrusive police action.
That sounds like lawyer speak
for "I did it. I did it.
I'm guilty."
Mr. Coles,in a week or so, forensics
is gonna have processed
the D.N.A. that was under
the victim's fingernails.
We're gonna need a sample
from you.
That's ridiculous. That--
that is completely unnecessary.
No, it's just
a pinprick. Doesn't hurt a bit.
Julius, please.
Tell me...
You did not kill...
That young woman.
No, I didn't.
That one--that--that
looked like it did hurt. Huh?
She was a sweet girl.
I'd see her
when I came to meet Bret.
She liked to talk about
the book she was reading.
Things just went from there.
I-I was...
I was very fond of her.
And then Herren came
into the picture.
Celia said she had
to tell Herren the truth...
About us.
I told her, Visualize was
my only client.
Bret would banish me
if he knew I-I was involved
with a member.
She just kept saying
she couldn't lie.
She couldn't lie
to save my career.
I got angry.
And we fought.
It happened.
So we have a deal?
D.A. agreed--
involuntary manslaughter.
Three years with time served.
In exchange
for your cooperation
with the FBI's investigation
into Visualize and Bret Stiles.
Okay, you got it.
I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Coles.
Mm.
Ah.
Three years is nothing.
It's the way of the world.
He's selling Stiles. He's a big
fish. The FBI has to pay.
If you think about
this stuff too much,
you'll drive yourself crazy.
Hey, that's the boyfriend--
David Herren.
Oh!
Gun!
Drop your gun!
Drop it!
Drop it now!
Get your hands above your head!
Don't move!
Get your head down!
Head down!
I had to do something.
He killed my soul mate.
Inactivity is the sign
of the clouded mind.
Discipline, order, work.
Where'd you get the gun?
I stole it from the desk
of the manager.
He keeps it
for making night deposits.
Did anyone else know
what you were gonna do?
Put me in prison.
I don't care.
My heart is free.
The minute I saw him, I knew.
I did the right thing.
Did anyone else know?
No.
It was my idea.
Thanks for your time.
I understand
Herren confessed.
He didn't mention your name.
The poor soul.
But...
Why would he mention me?
Well... you didn't go
and tell him to kill the man,
but you clarified his options,
which is as good as killing him,
as far as I'm concerned.
Is that the official view?
Is this why
you wanted to see me?
'Cause a phone call
would have been fine.
The FBI's given up.
Oh, that's a shame.
I rather enjoyed Brother Wench
and his clumsy machinations.
Oh, well, there it is.
You're safe.
Bravo.
Well, always nice to know,
but that's not why I'm here.
It seems
that your friend John
is planning
a surprise party for you.
How do you know
what Red John is planning?
It doesn't matter.
It certainly matters to me.
How do you know
what Red John is planning?
My dear chap,
I know so much more
than you or Red John
could ever imagine.
Accept this
as a gift from a friend.
Or not.
Clear!
All clear.
Clear.
Boss.
Boss.
Kristina?
Kristina.
E.M.T. Said
she had a puncture wound
in one arm, like from an I.V.
Must be how Red John
got the blood out of her.
He also said there was
no other sign of assault--
physical, sexual, anything.
Why won't she speak?
What did he do to her?
Still nothing.
Not a sound.
Okay.
Remember this?
Come on, Kristina.
Listen, it's Jane.
You remember me.
I know you do.
Hmm?
What's the worst date
you ever had?
Huh?
Kristina, please.
Please stop this.
Just speak to me.
Psych personnel are
on their way.
Could be worse, you know.
She could be dead.
I guess tea is
always worth a try.
What is he doing?
I have no idea.
I call on the spirits.
I ask for the presence
of the departed soul
of Kristina Frye.
Reveal yourself,
Kristina Frye.
Can you hear me, Kristina?
I can hear you, Patrick.
Well, thank you.
Thank you
for speaking with me.
I'm so glad you called on me.
I knew in the end,
you'd become a believer.
I am not a believer.
I hear sadness in your voice.
Don't be sad, Patrick.
Death is not the end.
The afterlife's
a beautiful place.
It's peaceful here.
Happy.
You're not dead.
You're talking to a ghost
and still you're a skeptic.
You are impossible.
You're not dead, Kristina.
You're alive.
You're in denial.
Eventually,
you'll accept the truth.
I know it's hard.
God knows I struggled
against it myself.
But you can't... fight...
Death.
How did you die?
I don't remember.
It's funny how things
become unimportant.
It's as if my life was
a dream.
I woke up.
I can't recall what happened.
Did you see Red John?
Who?
Red John.
Red John--
the man that abducted you.
I don't understand
what you're talking about.
Oh. Sure.
Apparently, Bret Stiles
is out of the country.
He's opening a center
in Jakarta.
Visualize people say they don't
know when he'll be back.
Hmm. Figures.
Hmm.
Boss. We caught one.
Downtown.
Are you okay?
We're up. Let's go.
