Your father?
Dead?
What's your name?
I don't want it anymore.
I'll give you a new one.
Leo.
Like a lion.
Leo: Vasili, fire your weapon!
Shit.
Leo: Fall back!
Vasili, get down!
Vasili, shoot back!
Leo: Alexei! Cover me!
Soldier: Let's move out!
Leo: Vasili, fire your weapon!
Vasili! Hey, Vasili!
You can come up
the stairs now. It's safe.
Don't be coward.
No one will shoot you.
Leo: Alexei,
just leave him alone.
Give him the flag.
Vasili: Me?
You.
You, too.
Come with me.
Me?
Yeah.
Tortoise: Leo, make us proud.
Leo: I will, sir.
Photographer: Okay.
Get up there. On the spire.
Now let's show the people
how Berlin has fallen
to the red army.
Lose the goddamn watches.
What?
Take them off. Stolen watches.
They can't be seen.
Alexei: Hey, Leo!
What?
Admiral, he don't
like my watches.
You take this.
Leo: He doesn't like watches?
No. He doesn't like
German watches.
Grab the flag
and get up there.
Yeah, come up here.
You take the flag.
Okay, wait, wait.
Alexei: Take the flag.
Photographer:
Catch a big wind,
so we can see our flag.
Good, that's right.
Leo: Like this?
Photographer: Yeah, great.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
One more.
You're sure?
Yeah.
Leo: Do you remember
when we first met?
Raisa, remember
when we first met?
You thought that I was rude.
You were rude.
I was not rude.
You were staring at me.
I was...
I was mesmerized.
I was mesmerized by your beauty.
Even had to get off
at the wrong Metro station
just to ask you your name.
I lied.
She did.
She told me her name was Lena.
Yes. I didn't know you then.
So you still lied.
I turn up at the park
to see my beautiful Lena.
No Lena.
Raisa: It was raining.
It was raining for a week.
Leo: It was raining.
Questionable.
But then I found you somehow.
that I met you before.
Then I asked you...
Well, I convinced you
to walk with me that day.
And when we got
to the school gate,
I held your hands,
and I looked into your eyes,
and I said to you,
"Lena,
"Lena, Lena, Lena, Lena,
"Lena, Lena, Lena,
"I am so ready
to kiss you right now."
And do you know
what Lena told me?
"Comrade demidov,
my name is raisa."
Who's raisa?
So now
I have to go back to work,
and tell all my friends
that I'm in love with raisa.
This beautiful raisa.
My friends,
they all laugh at me.
You were the worst,
I remember.
Laughed at me
because they say,
"last week,
we in love with Lena,
"this week, it's raisa..."
Next week, maybe Natasha.
Who knows?
With Leo
it's always someone new.
Leo: No, there will never
be somebody new.
There will only be you.
All those stories
are over for me now.
There is only you.
There will always only be you.
Always you.
Alexei: This is
the veterinarian's place.
Stinking zoo
for a stinking traitor.
Is he gone?
You can't say
I didn't tell you, boss.
Collect the evidence
for me, please.
And you have
no idea whatsoever
where anatoly brodsky
might be?
None.
All I can tell you,
he was...
Was?
Is.
Is?
He is a good neighbor.
Leo: I respect and admire
you trying to protect him,
but, you see,
for me it's different,
because we are here
in your home
because your friend,
companion,
he is a traitor, zina.
You understand?
And traitors have friends.
they are not our friends.
Do I have
to spell this out for you?
Zina,
now is the time to say
something.
Anything.
Mama! Mama!
Leo: No shooting.
Girl: Mama.
Don't move.
Semyon okun?
Yes.
Agent: There's no one else
in here.
Anatoly brodsky,
do you know him?
Yes, I know brodsky.
Right.
Do you know where he is?
Brodsky? In Moscow, I think.
No, he's not in Moscow.
We have information
that tells us
that he's staying
here with you.
No.
Oh, it's...
Wait, you said something.
Woman: Mmm-mmm.
Yes, you did. You did.
You said something.
No.
What did you say?
Alexei: Yuri, Nikolai,
spread out!
Leo: Brodsky!
Brodsky!
Don't fuck with me.
Put your hands
where I can see them.
Come on.
Get it over with.
Put your hands on your head.
Don't be stupid.
Shoot me.
Put your hands on your head.
Come on, shoot me!
Kill me! Kill me!
Come on, kill me!
Alexei!
Kill me!
Alexei! Alexei!
Alexei: I got this.
Nikolas!
Leo: He's fucking crazy.
Semyon: Please, I ask you.
I beg you. don't do this.
Please, don't kill my family,
my children.
These are
the future of Russia.
Please! No, please, I beg you!
What is he doing?
Please, no, don't hurt her.
I ask you, please!
No! No!
Please! I ask you, please!
No!
Leo: Vasili!
Leo: Hey! Vasili!
What the fuck are you doing?
Huh?
Making...
Making an example.
You're doing what?
Making example.
Making example of what?
These people are traitors.
Maybe now they can grow up and
learn a lesson from all this.
What did you fucking say?
They can learn
a lesson from this.
Learn something from you,
little shit? Huh?
What are they gonna
fucking learn from you?
You fucking coward!
Children! Fucking children!
What's your fucking answer?
Alexei: Leo.
I want men!
Leo.
Shit.
Get him out of here, because
I will fucking kill him.
Do you understand me?
Move him now.
Get these children
out of here.
What is wrong with you people?
Alexei!
Alexei!
Take care of this.
Shit!
Do you have any relatives
that live nearby?
Have you tried that
with a kopeck?
It's best with a kopeck.
Let me show you, okay?
Not here.
Little further down the line
would be better.
What's your name?
Jora.
You can save yourself
a lot of pain
and unnecessary suffering
if you talk to me. Hmm?
Yes.
Who are you working for?
Anna ivanovna akmatova.
She has a dog,
which will not eat.
Mattias borisky rakowski.
His terrier is going blind.
I'm a veterinarian.
I'm nothing more.
If you are so innocent,
why do you run?
Hmm?
That is a very good question.
I run because
you were following me.
When you are followed,
you are arrested.
And when you are arrested,
you are already guilty.
So you tell me.
Why did I run?
Do you have any idea
what happens
in this room next door here,
to a man like you,
when you don't talk?
A child knows
what will happen to me.
Should he cross?
All: No!
Raisa: What should he do?
All:
Yes. Good.
Because our leader
loves his children,
want them all to be safe.
Dr. zarubin:
This is sodium thiopental.
In less than a minute,
he will only
be able to speak the truth.
Okay.
Little bit more.
Wait. Wait.
Leo: Vasili,
ask your questions.
Vasili: Okay. I want the name
of every person
passing you information
from the British embassy.
Leo.
Leo.
What is it?
Raisa: Someone at the door.
Where?
Major kuzmin?
I came as fast as I could.
There has been
a terrible accident.
Alexei's son
has been hit by a train.
I thought you wanted to
hear it from me first.
A train?
Kuzmin: You and
alexei andreyevich
came through the war together,
didn't you?
Leo: Yes.
Kuzmin: We value alexei.
And we do everything
we can to protect him.
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.
You protect him?
The poor man
must be beside himself.
He's claiming
his son was murdered.
Stalin tells us that murder
is strictly
a capitalist disease.
But alexei is
flirting with treason.
So you know
what has to be done.
I will find someone on the
third floor to deal with this.
And who better
to do it than you?
Done.
Kuzmin:
Alexei.
Leo.
Come in.
I am so sorry.
I have been personally asked
to share
the official report with you.
"Yesterday morning,
"the body of one
jora andreyev,
"8 years old,
"was found
close by the train tracks
"He was found fully clothed.
"Further examination
"of the victim's body
and the witness..."
My boy was found naked.
No. He was found
fully clothed.
"Further examination..."
A train doesn't undress a boy.
"Further examination
of the victim's body
"and witness testimony
"show multiple contusions,
"with bruisings
and lacerations to the torso.
"In keeping with this testimony,
"we believe the cause of death
was indeed a tragic accident."
Nina: Why would a report
even bother to mention
that he was clothed?
Leo: This was signed
by Major kuzmin.
He is the department
of interior crimes
against the state.
Someone has slaughtered my son!
Your godson, Leo!
And you do nothing?
I am sorry.
Read the report.
To find out what?
Someone has
slaughtered your son.
Do something!
Alexei: Nina!
Nina: Someone has
slaughtered your son!
Someone has
slaughtered your son!
Someone has
slaughtered your son!
This is crazy.
You cannot do this.
I have men downstairs!
They can hear everything.
There is a reason
why they sent me.
You understand?
You have to be quiet.
They wouldn't let me
see him, Leo.
They wouldn't let me
see my boy.
Alexei, please,
will you just...
No, you tell me.
Read the file.
Tell me.
What should I tell her?
My wife?
You tell her
whatever it takes
to protect every single
body in that room.
Everybody in there,
who you love,
you tell them
whatever it takes.
Do you understand?
And you let him go.
Alexei, there can be
no murder in paradise.
Remember?
There's a witness, Leo.
Excuse me?
A woman.
What do you mean?
She saw that man.
She saw the man
who took my boy.
She saw him.
You have a witness?
Yes.
And she will testify?
Maybe. Her windows
overlook the tracks.
She saw jora with a man.
My boy was murdered.
You don't know this.
I know it.
And you don't lie to me,
because you know it, too.
You know it.
Leo: I want the coroner
to do a full autopsy
on the andreyev child.
Kuzmin:
there was a problem
with vasili in kimov.
I apologize.
You're only flesh and blood.
Striking a fellow officer
can bring you
the kind of attention
you could live without.
But you did a great service
by talking to the andreyevs.
Alexei will thank you.
One day.
By the way,
brodsky. Full confession.
He gave us seven names.
Six went to others.
Considering you're
one of my most
thorough investigators,
I gave you the toughest
nut of the bunch.
So, you asked for a full
autopsy of that boy.
What's his name?
Jora alexei andreyevich.
Jora?
Kuzmin: This one is yours.
We don't have much,
as you'll see.
So you are to collect
further information.
And if brodsky
was telling the truth,
if that individual
is a traitor,
you are to arrest them
and bring them here.
The usual process.
Any questions?
Ivan: You know, if reading
was an olympic event...
Raisa!
Raisa!
Raisa!
No, no, please, no.
Zoya: Please help me!
No, no, no, please.
Zoya: Raisa!
She has no...
What is the charge?
Zoya: Raisa!
Why her?
Because she couldn't keep
her goddamn opinion
to herself. That's why.
Ivan, maybe we should go
our separate ways.
Raisa.
Tortoise: Is she a traitor?
They have a confession.
Mmm.
And who took this confession?
A colleague of mine.
Could it have been manufactured?
Of course.
Do you have evidence?
No.
So what are you going to do?
If I do not denounce raisa,
and she is a traitor,
they have something on her
that I don't know about,
I don't find or...
Obviously, we are all guilty
by association, regardless.
What did you expect
when you came here?
That we didn't mind dying?
That raisa would be saved?
But if you don't denounce her,
we will die.
All four of us.
But the only difference,
that you would die
knowing in your heart
that you did the right thing.
And so you calculate.
One dead. Or four.
One dead. Or four.
Are you expecting somebody?
It's raisa.
She always eats with us
on wednesdays.
Anna.
Oh, raisa.
Good to see you.
He was working nearby.
For once we can eat
as a family.
How was school?
Good.
Good.
And you've come here...
Did you walk
straight from work?
Normally, I would be,
but I had
a doctor's appointment...
Doctor's appointment?
...at the kuzminski prospekt.
Yes.
You sick?
All right?
Yes.
Not sick?
No.
Why do you go doctor?
I wanted to tell you
when we're on our own.
Why?
We are all family here.
We don't keep secrets
from one another.
I'm pregnant.
Anna: That's wonderful news.
Anna: Congratulations.
Hmm.
Excuse me.
Anna: We are going
to be grandparents.
What?
Kuzmin sent us.
We're here to help.
Wow!
Very nice apartment.
What are you doing?
There is better way
than that.
That is not the way.
You feel the cushions.
You think it was me,
don't you?
But no one
ever listens to me.
don't you know that?
Eva: Ivan, please!
Ivan, please!
Ivan: Gentlemen, please.
She teaches domestic arts.
Sewing.
What could she have possibly...
It's fine, it's fine.
Purse.
They took one of my
colleagues today.
Eva. Friend of mine.
Do you know whose name
ended up on my desk?
Can you imagine?
No.
No?
You.
You have been named.
Do you want to know by who?
Hmm?
Anatoly brodsky.
Do you know him?
Does it matter?
Yes, it matters.
It matters to me.
Mmm-hmm.
They asked me to denounce you.
Raisa,
are you a spy?
No.
No.
You do know what happens
to us now. Right?
Yes.
It's just our turn.
Coroner: Demidov, you asked
for the autopsy report.
I was forbidden
to show it to you.
Doesn't matter.
It's not important now.
I thought you might
want to know.
There's been another one.
Another what?
A train accident.
What is it?
Two boys.
Found by the tracks.
Both naked.
Same cause of death.
Which is?
Drowning.
Leo:
Coroner: But there are
no rivers, no lakes
next to the places
where they were found.
And around the Iris,
hemorrhaging.
Leo:
Coroner: Jora andreyevich,
he had visual signs of trauma.
Cuts, Leo.
Targeted.
Not random.
It was almost
with surgical precision.
Stomach removed.
Missing.
This is not the work
of some average idiot.
You are sure you don't want
to reexamine your report?
There is no need.
I found nothing.
Leo,
I am sure you realize
what this means?
Major kuzmin,
I have stood here
for the past 10 minutes
telling you exactly
the same thing.
Because it is the truth.
I found nothing.
Raisa demidova
is innocent.
This is all you can take.
You carry nothing
on your person,
except your clothes
and your papers.
Alexei, why did you...
That's fine.
That's okay.
All right.
Please, give me five minutes,
because she's...
Alexei: You know
the rules, Leo.
Please, five minutes.
Just get dressed.
You have two minutes.
Leo: Want five.
You fucking dog!
Don't you fucking touch her.
Alexei, I will put him through
the fucking window.
It's fine. It's fine.
Leo: Jesus.
Let her be.
Agent: Here.
Raisa: No! No, Leo! No, Leo!
Leo: Where are you taking her?
No, Leo! No!
Leo: Raisa?
Raisa, are you there?
Raisa: Yes.
Leo: Did they hurt you?
Raisa: No.
Good. Do exactly as they say.
Raisa?
You must not be scared.
All right?
Hey, I understand.
Let go of me!
Let go!
I understand.
Come here.
It's okay, it's okay.
She is pregnant!
Raisa: What are they doing?
It's all right. Shh.
This is where we wait
for the truck, okay?
Look, you see?
This is where the truck comes.
They pick us up. They take
us away. Do you understand?
But where are we going?
I don't know.
It's okay. She's pregnant.
She's pregnant.
Leo, where are we going?
Where are we going?
I thought you'd like
to see the place.
One last time.
I'm sentimental like that.
Raisa. Raisa.
You're going to volsk,
which, from what I've heard,
is pretty much
the asshole of the earth,
and join the militsia.
You know, all he had to do
was to denounce you,
and in a year
the whole building
would be kissing his ass.
It was the only option.
But you won't listen.
Enjoy your new life.
You know,
this whole thing
was just a test
of blind obedience.
You should have given me up.
That's what wives are for.
What are you waiting for?
I only heard three days ago
you were coming.
It's unusual.
Because I made no requests
for additional men.
And I'm a little confused
about the orders.
The militsia
is a significant demotion
for a man of your stature.
We go where we are needed.
Nesterov: Do you know
what I heard?
I heard they made you take off
a dozen stolen watches
before they handed you
that flag.
There are no advantages
to being in militsia.
Once an apartment is found,
you will be assigned.
But it's
a very long waiting list.
You start tomorrow.
Basurov: The bar
doesn't give credit.
Toilet is down the hall.
Comrade director,
raisa demidova.
I have been assigned here.
Would you be so kind
to show me to my classroom?
Fine.
Here is your classroom.
If we need you
for anything else,
we will tell you.
Nesterov: Demidov.
Man: Varlam, wait! Varlam!
Goodbye, general nesterov.
Goodbye, varlam.
Man: Let's go, varlam.
Nesterov: It's tragic.
But even the party
can't be responsible
for the acts
of a mental defective.
Your rank is in my hands,
you see.
Yes, sir.
We are here.
It's a boy.
He was found naked.
They say he looks
like he was tortured.
I have two kids myself.
It makes me sick.
Dr. tyapkin:
It's been here a while.
Nesterov: What's a while?
Dr. tyapkin: Week. two.
It could be anyone
from the orphanage.
Uh-huh.
Nesterov:
Perhaps he has a twin.
Dr. tyapkin: A brother would
be good for identification.
Leo: Excuse me, general.
How old is he, about eight?
Eight years old?
He has blood in his eyes.
See? Is blood.
Hemorrhaging.
You see it in strangulations.
But look at his neck.
He has no track marks
on his throat.
So, what else can cause that?
You also see it in drownings.
Drowning. Yes.
Do you see
any water around here?
About 6 kilometers east.
The river in tobol.
So, a drowned boy
walks 6 kilometers?
This is little boy.
Look, you see this cut here?
It seems purposeful, no?
They are.
Someone knew their anatomy.
Organs have been removed.
And so you say organs
have been removed
from this child's body?
So it's what?
We look for butcher?
We look for a hunter?
Dr. tyapkin:
More like a surgeon.
More like surgeon?
More like surgeon.
Will you excuse us?
Why are you here?
A child was murdered
in Moscow.
What are you doing here?
Water came out of his mouth.
Same as this child!
Are you still
working for the mgb?
No, I'm not mgb.
I think you are.
Why are you here?
Why are these children
so important to Moscow?
Believe me, these children
are not important to Moscow.
Whatever it is
you've been sent here to do...
Remember, you are not
in Moscow anymore.
Here, we have an arrangement.
If you do anything
to endanger my team.
If you report anything
which undermines my authority.
If you portray my officers
as incompetent.
If you do
any of these things,
I will kill you myself.
Dr. tyapkin: General nesterov!
He has identification papers.
Isaac rudensky.
From the gorsky school
in oblast x.
Where exactly is oblast x?
Seven stations down the line.
General,
if he came by train,
maybe the ticket master
will recall
seeing him with someone.
Perhaps.
Where's the ticket master?
Budenny: Aleksander.
He's over there.
Aleksander,
when you found
the body last night,
you were taking a walk,
you say?
What's wrong?
What? Are you okay?
Nesterov: Or perhaps you were
doing something else?
Man: Get in.
Now.
Yes?
Vasili:
Yes?
Vasili.
You're getting a very
bad deal here. You know?
good little mousewife
and look at where
you find yourself.
Vasili, you know me.
What have I done?
My point exactly.
So here's what I propose.
These guys will put you on
the next train to Moscow,
and you can have
your old job back.
I will personally find you
a nice little place to live.
Assuming, of course,
you wouldn't rather
with me.
Leave Leo.
Come on, raisa,
you never fooled me.
All you ever wanted from him
was his head in a basket.
No.
No?
No.
You see that bald guy
in a blue suit?
Yes.
You know
what would be really nice?
No.
Give him the phone.
What?
Raisa?
Where are you going? Huh?
Where are you going?
Away. Yes.
Away?
Wait, listen to me,
listen to me.
Whatever you feel about me,
whatever is going on,
whatever you are thinking,
we are here now.
That is it.
This is where
we find ourselves.
There is nothing
that we can do about this.
I would rather
spend a lifetime
in a shithole like this
with you
than spend one minute
in Moscow without you.
Say that to someone
who doesn't know you.
What are you gonna do
without papers?
Did you forget something? Huh?
Yes, you forget these?
Give me my papers.
You know what happens to a
woman like you without papers?
She gets stopped.
She gets arrested.
She gets questioned.
Then guess what happens.
Give me my papers.
Don't you ever do that again.
Ever. Do you...
Huh?
So I'm your prisoner now?
Like everybody else?
You want to kill me? Huh?
You had your chance in Moscow.
The dinner we had
with your parents.
I heard you
when I came in the hallway.
Your beloved father
was pretty convincing.
I just stood there
hearing him over and over.
"Four lives against one.
Four lives against one."
What about four lives
against two?
Would you be so quick
to kill your own child?
What do you mean by that?
What are you saying?
Raisa, what do you mean
by this? Why you say that?
No.
No, no, you...
You're not pregnant?
I'm not pregnant.
Are you saying
you're not pregnant?
Would you have stood up
for me if I wasn't?
I didn't want to die, Leo.
Why are you saying this?
Huh?
Why?
That story you love so much.
When we first met.
And I lied
and I said
that my name was Lena.
"Lena, Lena, Lena."
So romantic.
I gave you a false name
because you had mgb
written all over you,
and I was terrified.
When you asked me
to marry you,
I cried for one week.
And then I said "yes."
I married you out of fear
for what would happen to me
if I said "no."
You don't mean that.
I married you
because that's what people do.
They put up. They tolerate.
They do whatever
they need to do to survive.
"Marry me," you said.
What choice did I have?
What choice did I have?
Homosexuality
is a serious crime.
Please, just say...
What do you want?
A list of men in this town
who have had sex
with other men.
What?
Men who have had sex
with younger men.
With boys.
What?
Fifteen years in the gulag
is a long time.
Even if you survive the camps,
you'll be disgraced.
Aleksander: Please,
just tell me what to do.
If you open the door for us,
maybe your issue
can remain a secret.
Just a few names, aleksander.
Leo.
Were you followed?
Are you sure?
What are you doing here?
You tell me.
What are you doing here?
Aleksander could
not have killed this boy.
It's not possible.
When I saw jora,
he had the same cuts and marks
as this child.
Whoever killed this little boy,
killed alexei's child, too.
I know it.
It's the truth.
Just have to prove it.
I must.
I have to.
I have to prove it.
Leo,
do you know what people
get around here
when they demand the truth?
Do you?
They get terror.
Raisa, we are already dead.
Nesterov: Come inside.
Leo: The killer,
he's a traveler.
Hmm.
We found a little boy
from the track.
I'm thinking how else
could he get here,
if it was not for train?
And then the boy in Moscow.
Again with Moscow.
This boy in Moscow is the son
of a very good friend of mine.
My brother.
I was sent to his house
to read official report.
I had to tell his family
that his son died
of tragic accident.
And I lied.
So I'm thinking, how many
more children have to die?
Get swept under the carpet.
Covered up by party dogs
like you and I.
And their blood
is on our hands.
And this animal,
he will not stop killing.
This will not stop.
He will keep killing
and killing.
Enough!
What do you want?
Me? I would like to stop him.
A ghost.
Ghost? No, it's not ghost.
Describe him to me then.
I can't.
I can't describe him.
But there is a witness.
I must go back to Moscow
and speak with her.
And you must gather the
records of all dead children
from Moscow to Leningrad.
Me?
And why would
I do that for you?
Raisa: Inessa, your boys,
do they walk to school
by themselves?
Normally, yes.
But this week,
with those poor children,
either myself or...
Raisa: And from here
to school, it seems
the shortest way
is through the forest.
Is that the way they go?
Usually.
But again, this week,
the way through town
seems safer.
Raisa: Hmm. Yes, of course.
But now that the killer
has been caught,
will they be going
through the forest
by themself tomorrow as usual?
Morning.
Morning.
Where are you headed to today?
Nowhere.
Just waiting
to buy some stamps.
But the kiosk isn't open yet.
Collect stamps?
Used to be a collector
when I was your age.
Tell me,
do you take care
of your collection?
Yes.
I have a son.
About your age.
Very messy boy.
He could care less
about stamps.
As for me,
just don't have
the time for them anymore.
Maybe you should give them
to someone
to take care of them for you.
Yes.
I bet you like sweets,
don't you?
I made them myself.
Dark ones are the best.
Good?
Mmm-hmm.
General nesterov.
You know,
Moscow is growing suspicious
of you summoning me
like this.
I demand...
Bring me all files
involving the death
of children
between the ages
of 9 and 15.
Yes, sir.
Everything you have.
Yes.
And pray
that they're all there.
Stop crying. Sniveling shit!
You four-eyed little pig.
Oh, yes.
A toast, mewling,
sniveling little pig.
One more time,
to Joseph Stalin!
Father to us all!
There is a situation in rostov.
What situation?
A boy has been discovered
near the train station.
They think
he was attacked by a wolf.
Nesterov:
ages 9 to 14.
All found in forests, parks,
by the train lines.
Naked and either marked
for cuts or with cuts.
Drowned.
When they bothered
to examine the remains,
every one of them
solved by arrest.
Forty-three in all.
Forty-four.
My friend's son
was murdered, too.
And there's
a new one in rostov.
I'm heading there tomorrow.
Rostov.
I have to go to Moscow.
I need you to come with me.
I cannot protect you
if you stay here alone.
I don't need
your protection anymore.
If you come with me
to Moscow,
then I promise you,
you have my word
that I will do anything
and everything that you want.
Whatever it is you ask.
If you want to leave volsk,
if you want to leave me,
if you want to leave.
You never ever even
have to see me again.
I promise.
You may have my word.
Nesterov:
I've granted you
a walking holiday.
That'll explain
your absence from here.
Alexei: What are you
doing here, Leo?
You're not
supposed to be here.
Alexei, it's about your son.
He was murdered.
You've come
to the wrong address.
No boy was murdered here.
No, no, no.
I've made a mistake.
It's not true. It's not true.
I was wrong.
I was wrong,
you were right.
I have the papers here.
His death certificate says
much more than we know of.
Raisa: Look.
From Moscow train station
all the way down
the train tracks to rostov.
It's very serious.
And if you find this man, Leo,
what will you do?
I bring him to justice.
You will bring him to justice?
You're nobody anymore, Leo.
You're nobody.
How you gonna
bring him to justice?
Just the two of you?
Is this a joke?
Leo, if you really wanna help,
you find this man
and you cut his head off!
Can you do that?
Leo: Yes.
For you, alexei,
I will do this.
But if I do that,
then nobody will ever know.
Please.
Nina, we need
to see the witness.
How can I help?
I don't know anything.
Listen, galina,
the man that killed my son,
he's still out there,
killing other children,
do you understand?
Nobody, nobody can get
into any trouble
by simply describing
what a worker looked like
on his way to work.
Do you understand?
It's not possible.
He's here, talking to you.
I'm here.
I guarantee you I am
no threat. You have my word.
Look at me. I have no uniform.
I promise you, you are safe
to speak to me, so please.
It was dark.
Yes?
Please.
Man: Galina!
What's going on?
Galina!
Who are you talking to?
Please, whisper to me.
What did he look like?
We are just
making conversation.
There is no problem here.
Please.
Get out of my house!
Please, calm down.
Take it easy.
Easy? You want easy?
You want easy?
Raisa, I have to go.
Please, you must
remember something.
Man 2: Get out!
Are you on your own?
Does your mother
know where you are?
Is that heavy?
It's heavier than it looks.
I could carry it.
All right then. Up you get.
Let's see
what you're made of.
Hello!
Son, you're getting
far too heavy for me to carry.
Hi.
Vlad: Hello, sweetheart.
What did I tell you?
I wanted to meet daddy.
What are you worried about?
He's with me.
Eh?
Come on.
Man: In the war,
Hitler left hidden
revenge squads
all the way back to the rhine.
I saw what those German
soldiers were capable of.
Is there anything else?
He fed them special drugs
to make them addicted
to the blood of children.
Now it's all coming to a head.
Nine children around here
Found like artur
in the past two years.
Nine?
Man: That bloody monster
is still killing us.
Even from his grave.
Sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Man on pa: All citizens
are required
The station is temporarily
under mgb jurisdiction.
All citizens are required to
show proper identification.
The station is temporarily
under mgb jurisdiction.
I think it's not good.
It's not good.
We can't go this way.
We have to find another way.
I think I know someone
who can help us.
I don't like this.
I don't like him.
I don't trust him.
But I do.
We all thought
you'd been arrested.
Or worse.
Leo refused to denounce me.
Why did you refuse?
She's my wife.
You traveled all the way
back to Moscow
at, I assume,
great personal risk.
Mmm-hmm.
Why?
Leo: You see,
Each of these children
have been murdered
over the past
several years and
each of these individual cases
has been solved
by the state.
The perpetrators dealt with.
But if you look very closely
and examine the children,
they have all been killed
in a similar manner.
So what you're saying is
somebody is responsible
for this?
Leo: Absolutely.
And this somebody
is still out there.
Raisa: Yes.
A murderer.
You're saying
there's a murderer?
Without doubt.
You do realize there are
no murderers in paradise?
So you two are working
together now? As what?
Outraged citizens?
Raisa: Sort of. Yes.
Going to capture
this troll by yourselves?
Somebody has to.
Ivan, look at these pictures.
Do you see?
These children.
Look. This is real.
Look at these names,
those documents.
The documents. Let's carefully
examine the documents.
Raisa: Yes.
Ivan: With all these names.
All these...
All these children.
Raisa: Ivan!
Who is in charge
of these wrongdoings?
Raisa: Ivan!
All right.
You are making me nervous.
Close the curtains.
All right.
Thank you.
Look.
I know someone who,
if he's willing,
can get you out of the city.
Raisa: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Ivanov.
You have telephone?
Ivan: They forgot to remove it
when the last tenant died.
I keep it hidden.
Disconnected.
Save for emergencies.
Leo: Do you have
many emergencies?
Ivan: I have many problems.
Here we go.
Professor zalman?
Are you free at the moment?
Could he come
to the apartment?
I don't know
why he has this.
There was an incident
in school. I don't know.
He shouldn't have this.
Ivan: Yes, immediately,
if possible.
I'm afraid time is
of the essence.
Thank you, professor.
Hello? Professor?
Raisa: Leo! Leo, wait!
I don't know why he has it.
Leo, wait.
Leo, please.
Leo, please, stop this!
Traitorous scum.
We should have
killed you both.
I'm sorry.
I truly thought...
Thought what? That he wasn't
fishing with his books?
That he wasn't mgb?
Don't be sorry.
He couldn't draw you in if he
wasn't doing his job properly.
Listen...
I made you a promise.
Now you don't
have to stay with me.
Do you understand?
I'm coming with you.
What?
That guy.
He can't read.
Thank you, sir.
Did you find your witness?
Moscow was a complete wash.
Well, forget Moscow.
We go towards rostov.
It's the heart of this,
I'm sure.
All kill routes
passing through.
Plus twice
the number of children
murdered there
than anywhere else.
And I believe
he works and kills
What is the connection
between volsk and rostov?
There are no murders
east of here.
This may be his end point.
Mmm, but what is here for him?
The gaz factory?
Gaz factory.
And what's in rostov
for the factory?
The rostov tractor factory.
So it's likely he works there.
We find his job
and we find him.
Hello, Leo.
You miss me?
Some people
just don't learn, I guess.
I'd like a word in private.
Nesterov: Inessa.
I understand your desire
to stay loyal to him.
My point being,
it will be better
if you told me
everything immediately.
Would it make any difference?
Of course.
You're a monster.
Raisa, I hope you understand
you leave me no choice.
Leo, what did they do to you?
Leo! Please, Leo.
Leo.
Leo. Leo, please.
Leo! Listen to me.
You have to wake up.
Leo! Leo, please! Leo! Leo!
Raisa: Leo!
Leo!
Raisa: Are you all right?
We need to get off this train.
It was a guard.
That man behind the door.
He gave them knife.
We must get off this train.
Jump, raisa, now! Jump!
Go.
Vasili:
The arrangements
were made last minute.
There's no paper trail.
No one able to preplan.
No one even knew
which transport they were on.
You did.
Didn't you?
Listen to me, you.
I promise you something.
If my time is up,
so is yours.
You wanted his desk?
Then take the weight
that comes with it.
Alexei,
tell me why Leo
was arrested.
See, the bosses believe that
he was working for the west,
but I believe
he was working on this.
Series of child murders,
you see?
Your son,
may he rest in peace,
he was murdered, yes?
No. He was killed
in an accident.
But at first you believed
he was murdered, right?
Sit down.
At first, yes, I did.
But, you see, I was upset.
So when
he came back to Moscow,
it wasn't your son's murder
he was interested in?
Well...
I don't...
All I'm saying is that
if my son's death was Leo's
reason to return to Moscow,
he never contacted me.
Is that how little
you think of me?
I don't think
anything of you.
You think you can save Leo?
You can't save Leo, alexei.
You know that, right?
But you can still
save your family.
My family survives, vasili.
If I may ask you,
where exactly did they escape?
Come here.
It's right here.
Near Vladimir.
Well,
seems that
the earliest incidents
were all around this area.
The highest concentration
around rostov-on-don.
If I was Leo,
I would be heading to rostov.
Is that all?
Vasili: That's all.
Man: Rostov factory.
Raisa: Leo, we are here.
Leo: Stay with me.
I'll have to find a way
into the records office.
If I'm not back
in half an hour...
You will be.
Leo: Wait here.
Where are you going?
You! Turn around.
Put your hands
against the wall.
Hands on the fucking wall.
Don't move.
What's your name?
Sergei.
Okay, Sergei,
listen to me.
You do exactly as I say.
Just relax.
Slow down.
What do you sell here
in your factory?
What do you make?
Sergei: The tractor parts.
Leo: Tractor parts?
Yes.
Leo: Up your stairs.
Open your door.
Get inside.
Give me your keys.
Sit down. Put your hands
where I can see them.
What do you want?
I want you to sit down.
And put your hands
where I can see them.
Sergei, listen very carefully.
I have here some documents.
And on these documents
there are areas
and there are dates
in these columns. You see?
I need you to find me
the controller
who has visited
these areas in this column,
in or on or around these dates
here in this column.
Do you understand?
I understand.
I need you to find him now.
Okay now. May I?
Of course.
So...
That's not it.
Yes, Major kuzmin.
And don't fill
my ear with shit.
Nothing. They're idiots here.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
I'm tired
of your excuses, vasili.
Just find them,
or it's both our necks.
Sergei: Fifty-five.
Fifty-two.
Yes, I think I got it.
This one.
Are you sure?
I hope. I am sure.
Sit down. Put your hands
where I can see them.
Raisa.
Sir.
The tractor factory.
A man was attacked
in the administration office.
What happened?
It's just some
employment files were stolen.
They're here.
Raisa: That's his car.
He knows.
Please, be careful.
Leo.
There's somebody up there.
Stay here.
Leo, be careful.
You have come.
Brings back memories,
doesn't it?
These woods and banks.
Scrounging for grub.
Rat.
Cat if we were lucky.
Always so hungry.
Some of us
even ate each other.
The weaker ones.
I know who you are, demidov.
I know you were
in an orphanage,
just like me.
Who in the whole country
does not know that?
How the war redeemed you.
Made you into a hero.
Some of us were not so lucky.
I was a surgeon in the army.
But no matter.
At the end of the day,
hero,
monster...
We are both killers,
you and I.
Tell me,
are there no children
on your conscience, Leo?
You knew what you were doing
and you chose to do it.
But me,
I can't help it.
I can't.
Vasili: Drop the gun, Leo.
Drop it.
Get up here.
Get down.
You know,
this reminds me of that...
Of that farmer, okun.
Was he innocent, Leo?
Are you innocent?
Are you?
Raisa: Please...
Vasili: My big brother.
Always telling me
what's right and wrong.
I never wanted this, Leo.
Please.
Never.
Please.
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.
Vasili!
Vasili: Son of a bitch!
Leo!
Vasili: Fucking bitch!
Raisa: Leo!
Leo!
Vasili!
God.
Halt!
Leo: Officer,
this man...
This man is criminal.
Your superior officer,
he died whilst trying
to apprehend him. This man...
This man is a hero.
This officer is hero!
Grachev: Congratulations
on your reinstatement.
Major kuzmin was
arrested yesterday, you know.
Yes, I heard.
He was
an old guard appointee.
We live in new times,
demidov.
Yes, I have heard.
Mmm-hmm.
I've been authorized to
offer you a promotion.
In the new
state security organization.
And a clear path
to a political role,
should you want it.
Please.
No, please.
I am good standing.
Feels fine.
Vlad malevich.
labeled him
"the werewolf of rostov."
Werewolf?
Mmm.
We discovered he spent
two years in a German camp
during the war.
Now anybody who survives
two years in that situation
must have been turned.
Obviously, we repatriated
a Nazi agent.
Wouldn't you agree?
It is possible.
But was he not brought up
in Russian orphanage, no?
We believe he was trained
to take revenge on us
for their defeat.
They wanted
the Russian people to believe
that our society
could produce such a monster.
Whereas, obviously, he was
corrupted and transformed
by his time in the west.
Was that not
your thinking, demidov?
It is very difficult.
Difficult?
Why difficult?
No, it's very difficult
to ascertain exactly
which society
is responsible for causing
vlad malevich
to become what he was.
Bullshit.
Sir, if I may,
I wish to refuse your offer
and make a request of my own.
Really?
Go on.
I want to create
and take charge
of Moscow homicide department.
And what need is there
of such a department?
As you said,
murder has been used before
to tear us down from within.
And vlad malevich?
Vlad malevich, I would say
returned home
with a poisoned foreign heart.
Without doubt. Absolutely.
Good.
Just one thing
I would like to ask you.
General nesterov.
I would also like him
to work for this department.
I believe
that his skills and ability
in matters of this kind
are exemplary.
I found them.
Would you like to see them?
Raisa: Yes, please.
They are in the waiting room.
This way, please.
Please.
Mmm.
Please.
Leo: Hello.
This is my wife raisa.
She's a... she's a teacher.
She teaches children. Eh?
Hello.
Elena, Tamara.
Why don't we all sit down?
It's much nicer sitting down.
Raisa: We would like,
if you want,
to give you a home. Our home.
Leo: Yes.
You came to our farm.
I mean, yes.
Yes, I did. I did.
But, um...
Um...
We wanna look after you.
Take care of you.
As my husband said,
I can teach you
how to read, write.
We can go to parks.
We have friends. There are
a lot of things we can do.
I can't bring
your parents back.
I can't. I can't do that.
It's not possible.
I would like to. Of course,
I would. But I can't.
And I am sorry.
I am truly very sorry.
We won't take you, if you
don't want to come with us.
We can find you
another family.
Leo: Yes.
Raisa: We promise you.
We won't leave you here.
Now we will go out for a walk
and you can think about it.
And then take your time.
Leo:
Do you think
that I am...
That I am
truly a frightful man?
You think that maybe I am
a monster?
No.
No?
