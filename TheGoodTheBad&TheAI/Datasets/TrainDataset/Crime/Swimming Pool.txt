Excuse me, but aren't
you sarah morton?
It is you.
I recognize you.
Look, I'm reading
your latest novel.
I love it.
I'm a big fan of Inspector Dorwell.
I've read all your books--
You must have mistaken me
with someone else.
I'm not the person
you think I am.
Excuse me.
****
Excuse me.
Good morning.
What would you like?
Whiskey, please.
Ice?
Yes.
Yeah. and after that
in all the directories.
And we will renew. most definitely.
that shouldn't be a problem.
Just a minute.
Hello, sarah. How are you?
Could be better.
Is John in?
Yes, but he's in a meeting.
Who with?
Terry Long.
Who?
Uh,just--
Yeah. I'm in the process
of drawing up the contract now
and it should be with you shortly.
Yeah, I'm absolutely sure.
Now, you're on
what's called ''a roll.''
You must keep the momentum
going. Take a short holiday,
but nothing too long.
sarah.
Um, let me introduce you.
sarah morton, Terry Long.
Terry Long, sarah morton.
I'm so pleased to meet you.
my mother adores you.
she's read all your Dorwell books.
Right. Well, Terry,
always a pleasure.
We'll speak very soon.
And congratulations again
on that award.
I'm sure it's the first
of many.
Oh, geez,John.
Very nice to have met you.
And do hurry. my mother's
impatiently awaiting the arrival
of the newest Inspector Dorwell book.
so what award
did that little shit get?
The manchester Book Critics.
Hardly the Booker Prize, I know,
but it's not bad for a first novel.
The ''little shit,'' as you call him,
has talent.
I just hope he sells.
I trust you taught him
your favorite motto.
And what motto's that?
You know damn well.
You drilled it into me
''Awards are like hemorrhoids.
sooner or later every asshole gets one.''
Did I say that?
my God, you're jealous,
aren't you?
You don't look after me anymore.
some encouraement does not mean
that  you.
Besides, you've never had
any problems finding inspiration
for the Dorwell series.
You write with such remarkable ease
I wonder you need me at all.
Okay, sarah, what's the matter?
an't be money.
You're rollin in it.
It's incredible. The only thing
you can find to talk about
to me is money.
ive a damn about money...
or success!
- I just want to find--
- An inspiring plot.
o. You don't understand.
It's-- It's got nothing
to do with inspiration.
I'm-- I'm fed up with murders...
and investiations.
Why don't you confound your critics
and write something completely different?
Put Dorwell on the shelf,
as it were.
You didn't like the last one, did you?
I knew it! And you haven't had
the balls to tell me.
That's simply not true.
You know very well I've loved
the Dorwell series right from the beginning.
As well you might...
considering the money they make you.
Do you like France?
I like frogs' legs.
my house.
Why don't you go there
for a while, hmm?
Breathe some fresh air.
It's free, it's out of season,
the weather's glorious.
There's a swimming pool.
Would you come and visit me?
Well. hter.
'll come
or a weekend.
- Are you marcel?
- Yes.
Hello, I'm sarah morton.
- How was your trip?
- Very nice.
- may I carry this?
- It's on wheels.
- I'll take the small one.
- Thank you.
my car is just outside.
Okay.
The bedrooms and bath are upstairs,
the kitchen's on the left.
I'll let you take a look around.
I turned on the hot water and gas.
If you need anything,
you've got my number?
- Yes,John gave it to me.
- Good.
To go to the village,
you can take the footpath I showed you...
or use the moped in the garage.
The keys are in the ignition.
Thank you, marcel. Good-bye.
Good-bye, madame.
Enjoy your rest.
our.
our.
What can I get for you?
- Um--
- An aperitif?
No.
Uh, maybe something lighter?
How about a panach?
No.Just a cup of tea.
Very well.
ice
is drastically reduced.
but the .
t's the second strike in two weeks...
and passen--
Hello?
Hello, Father. It's me.
Are you all right?
Yes, I've arrived safely.
How is the house?
The house is lovely.
The weather?
The weather's gorgeous.
How is the weather
in London?
Doesn't stop raining.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm okay.
Have you met anyone?
No, I haven't seen anyone.
You shouldn't stay by yourself.
Try to get out.
Father. Yeah--
Look, Father, if there's
a problem of any kind,
ask mrs. smith for help.
All right?
I don't need anyone's help.
Yes. You take care now.
You too.
All right. Bye-bye.
Good-bye.
Hello?
sarah!
John, how are you?
I'm very well.
I should be asking you
that question.
so, tell me,
how's everything going, darling?
Did marcel come and fetch you?
Yes, but listen. I have just
one thing to say to you,
and that's thank you.
You were right, as usual.
Your house is a little piece
of paradise.
And I've already begun working.
Hmm? so soon?
Yes. The idea kept running
through my mind
while I was on the train.
You know, one of those stupid things
that just latch on and won't let go.
Really?
I don't know where
it's heading, but--
so, what's Dorwell up to now?
Well, I'm not ready
to talk about it right now.
All right.
But I think it might be quite funny.
Anyway, I'm going to wait
until I'm sure.
Well, that's marvelous.
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
Have you been out
and about yet?
No. I'm just enjoying
the peace and quiet here.
Good.
Yeah. so, when are you
thinking of coming?
Um, I don't know.
I'm not sure.
It-- It depends on the work,
you know.
Um, look, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I've got another call
coming through.
Now, you take care,
and call me when you're ready
to read me something, all right?
Right.
Fine.
Good-bye,John.
You scared me!
Who are you?
What are you doing in my house?
Your house? This is my house!
I should be asking you.
Are you
That's correct.
I'm sarah morton. I'm a writer.
And my publisher,John Bosload,
is letting me this house.
Ah. so you're Daddy's
latest conquest.
You're his daughter?
so what? Didn't he warn you?
No, he didn't tell me
you'd be coming.
I'm not surprised. Is he here?
'm here on my own.
and 'm here to work.
aybe he'll come
and visit.
I'm glad he's not here.
Are you going to be staying long?
I don't know.
I don't have much work these days.
so, which bedroom did you take?
The one upstairs
overlooking the pool.
course.
That's the best one.
Well, I'm gonna unpack.
sorry.
Hello. Leave your name, number
and any message you might have...
and I'll get right back to you.
Bastard! You could have told me your
daughter was coming to your bloody house.
How do you expect me
to work now?
It's sarah. Good-bye.
I couldn't get through
to London.
Yes. Go and look for it
in the kitchen.
Personally, I'm gonna go back to bed.
I have to work early in the morning.
Fine. Good night.
sarah, right?
Right.
I'm Julie.
You're not too hot?
sorry. I woke you up.
No. I was just dozing.
You must be working too hard.
You should have a swim in the pool.
The water's cold. It'll wake you up.
Well, thank you for your advice,
but I absolutely loathe swimming pools.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I prefer the sea too.
The ocean.
The crashing waves.
the er.
that you could lose  at any time
and be swept away.
Pools are boring.
There's no excitement, no--
no feeling of infinity.
bathtub.
It's more like a cesspool
of living bacteria.
Oh, that? No, it's just a bit
of dirt and leaves.
A romance novel
God, no. I write crime fiction.
h.yeah. that's how
he makes his money.
And that's how he can afford to buy
a beautiful house in France
for his daughter to enjoy.
What about you?
Are your books selling well?
- I can't complain.
- What is this one about?
murders and
a police investigation.
In the Lubron
with rich English tourists.
Listen, if you don't mind,
I do have work to do.
Okay. I leave you alone,
miss marple.
need to make
some phone calls anay.
He was at the macumba?
No way!
With Jean-Pierre?
Yeah, right.
What a pervert!
You're gross!
He came back?
I don't know.
Going shopping?
No, I'm going to have lunch
in the village.
Ah, good idea.
By the way, I spoke to marcel.
He's coming very soon
for the pool.
His English bitch
has a broomstick up her butt.
- may I have the bill? Please.
- Yes.
about it.
I'm not going to bother her.
Anyway, it's a big house.
Did you ring mom?
I'm telling you,
she's still waiting, so hurry up.
Yes, c'est iao.
It's your publisher.
John? Hello? John?
He hung up.
Hello?
Hello, this is sarah morton.
Could I speak toJohn, please?
He's gone out.
Oh. Really?
Well, could you ask him
to call me back in France?
Okay then.
Yes, thank you. Good-bye.
He scolded me.
He told me not to bother you.
He said I should leave you alone
so you could work.
Listen,Julie.
I'm going to be frank with you.
I need peace and quiet
to concentrate.
And since we share
the same living space,
I must ask you just to go about
your business without getting
in the way of mine, hmm?
I mean, this house is certainly
big enough for the two of us.
so, please make an effort.
I was only trying to be polite
and make friends.
But if you prefer I don't--
I don't prefer anything!
I just want to work
on my book in peace.
Fine. That's too bad, though,
because I just bought loads
of nice food.
I guess I have to eat
my foie gras all alone.
- We're almost there.
- I'm wasted.
Are you okay?
- Where are we?
- my house.
You live here?
Yeah, I swear!
****
Can't you turn the music up?
No, the old bag's sleeping upstairs.
Oh.
Good morning.
our.
I made some coffee, if you like.
ui.
I hope we weren't too loud?
I don't speak French.
I can't understand a word.
ardon.
Get up!
I've got to get to work.
Just a quickie.
I'd love to, but I've really got to go.
And there's that woman.
- You saw her?
- Yeah, she's outside.
- she's a foreigner?
- Yes.
- English.
- Not bad looking.
so fuck her, if you like old maids!
I was just kidding.
Want me to drive you?
It's not far. see you later.
Thanks. It was nice.
- Call me sometime.
- No problem.
iao.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.
Are you from around here?
Yes, Lacoste.
Have you been there?
- No.
- The marquis de sade's castle is there.
Oh, right.
I've heard about it.
It's practically in ruins now, isn't it?
You can say that again.
But there's a nice panoramic view
of the Lubron.
It's beautiful.
I'll let you finish.
Oh, it's you.
Your bedroom's
not big enough for you?
Yes, it is, but he snores like a pig.
I couldn't get to sleep.
Expecting another one?
Bonjour.
I've come for the pool.
Julie called.
- Hi, marcel.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Not bad.
- You're back already?
- I was sick of work.
I felt like a rest.
This is sarah, a friend of my father's.
Yes, we've met.
Are you cleaning the pool today?
Isn't that what you wanted,Julie?
sarah wants to swim,
but it's too dirty for her.
our.
- Where's the girl?
- What girl?
I forget her name.
The little blonde.
Julie, maybe?
That's it.Julie, right.
Check out in the backyard
by the pool.
I believe she's getting some air.
Thanks, madame.
Bernard, this is marcel.
- He's my dad.
- stop joking.
Come on, marcel!
Going out?
Yes.  have to ask
Well, it would be nice
if you didn't make any noise
when you came home.
Yes, mother.
I pity your mother.
You pity her? Why?
Well, I imagine having a daughter
who comes home with a different man
every night must be difficult for a mother.
Well, you imagine wrong.
You know what?
You're just a frustrated English woman...
who writes about dirty things
but never does them.
You can shove your uptight morals
up your ass.
****
I was worried
when you didn't come home.
Are you gonna tell
my daddy?
Yes, maybe I will.
Then why don't you?
He would love it.
I'm not so sure about that.
How can you be so naive?
He's the king of orgies.
Didn't you know?
Julie?
Yes?
Would you like to go
out to dinner tonight?
Are you ready
Yes, I'm coming.
You're working, as usual.
h.
an old piece.
This is my underwear.
What's it doing here?
I found it in the garden
near the pool.
Where shall we go?
Not too far. I'm exhausted.
I see the waiter
isn't here tonight.
Franck?
maybe. I don't know his name.
It's Franck,
a boy from Lacoste.
During the off-season
he only works days.
I see.
Do you know him well?
A little. I see him
around sometimes.
You seem to know
just about everyone here.
Well, of course.
I've spent my whole childhood here.
But not with John?
No.
He abandoned us,
my mother and I.
He just came here
for the summer on holiday.
Do you resent him for that?
No, not really.
He lives his life, I live mine.
What about your mother,
is she French?
Yeah.
Where does she live?
In Nice.
Why are you so interested now?
Oh. Oh, I don't know.
Well, maybe you and I
got off to a bad start.
I was angry with you--
Well, actually,
I was angry atJohn...
for not really telling me
about you or her.
He's the one you're interested in.
When someone keeps an entire
part of their life secret from you,
it's fascinating and frightening.
I don't deny
that I want to know more.
But don't count on me
to tell you any secrets.
If you wanna know something,
you should askJohn.
I'm not asking anyone anything.
Yeah, sure.
You may pretend you don't care,
but I can see you're hoping
I tell you some things about my father.
Actually, I'm more interested
in your mother.
Why don't you live
with her in Nice?
That's a long story.
shall we order?
Yes.
'il vous plait.
I was 1 3 the first time.
I haven't stopped since.
I fell in love once.
We were 1 6.
It was summertime.
He was... handsome,
romantic, coming from Paris.
His name was Christian.
I was crazy about him.
I wanted him to take me,
but I was too fast for him.
He was a baby.
He didn't know how
to do those things yet.
He was terrible.
He came on me
after two seconds.
so I dumped him.
He wrote to me for a year,
but I never wrote back.
we built in the orest.
he asked me to mar him.
know.
we wereust kids.
but it made me c.
t was the first time anyone--
you
with my stories.
No. No, go on.
I'm enjoying it.
Go on
What happened to your eye?
It's nothing.
some asshole tried to hit me,
but I fought back.
He was bleeding like a pig.
Nobody better mess with me,
because if they do,
I'll mess with them back.
I suppose you don't want any?
Why not?
Never judge a book
by its cover.
I've done my share
of smoking.
And fucking?
Yes.
I was around
in swinging London.
Yeah. my mom already
told me about it.
What did she tell you?
How she metJohn.
How she seduced him.
How is your book coming?
It's coming.
Although, I must say,
it is quite strange...
to be writing a typically
English story set in London...
while I'm here in this house
in such beautiful weather.
my mom wrote a book too,
but it was never published.
He told her it was awful,
so she burned it.
Well, that's terrible.
Did you read it?
Yeah. I liked it.
It was a bit sentimental,
kind of a Harlequin romance,
but charming.
What was it about exactly?
About her and my ather.
with a happy endin.
But what he wants
is blood, sex and money.
That's what you give to him,
isn't it?
Yes.
But I like all that too.
Did your mother
live in this house?
ather.
especially in the summeime.
ut once they were truly separated.
she didn't want to come back anymore.
ice.
Anay. it's really his house.
id she want him to come
and live with her in
Yeah.
e
and or her.
ohn would never do that.
d
to be alone here.
ot me.
am like you.
Julie?
Julie, are you here?
Good evening.
Hello there.
I'd like you to meet a friend
of mine who's come for a drink.
Hello, madame.
I didn't know you were atJulie's.
I forgot to tell you,
sarah's a writer friend of my father's.
You didn't tell me you write.
Yeah, mysteries.
so watch your back!
Could you make us a drink, sarah?
I'll go get some weed in my room.
sit down, Franck.
make yourself at home.
Whiskey?
Yes.
Thank you.
This time you're serving me.
Got it.
What shall we drink to?
I don't know.
I know. To sarah's book.
To sarah's book.
What's it about?
Oh, I never discuss a book
before it's finished.
How about the last one then?
A police investigation in scotland.
What was it called?
I don't know the French title.
In English it was
ell Wears a Kilt.
What? What's that mean?
ell Wears a Kilt.
That's too funny!
Yeah, really, that's bizarre!
I'll leave you two alone now.
No.
Please,
stay for a while.
Okay.
**et's do it **
Come on!
Let's dance!
sarah?
**et's do it **
**et's do it **
**et's do it **
Come and dance, sarah.
No. No, no.
Please, come on.
**et's do it **
**et's do it **
**et's do it **
**et's do it **
****
This time it's good night.
Good night,Julie.
sweet dreams.
It's good night for me too.
- Do you want to take a midnight swim?
- Another time. I'm beat.
You would have if she came,
wouldn't you?
stop it,Julie.
Please stay!
-  Come on!
- I'm coming.
Get in!
- Hurry up!
- You promise it's not cold?
Is that all?
Come on. Take it all off!.
Whoo.!
missed!
stop it!
What are you doing?
Cut it out.
top it.!
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Leaving!
Why now?
Why are you leaving?
- stay!
- shut up!
- Please stay!
- Get off me!
What is it?
- Why are you closed?
- We won't be open until tonight.
But you're usually open.
I come every day.
Yes. Franck didn't show up this morning.
- Why not?
- maybe he overslept. He often does.
Perhaps something happened to him?
How should I know?
Excuse me. I've got work to do.
Did you sleep well?
No.
Where did this blood
come from?
What blood?
Here, on the tiles.
Huh?
Oh, right.
That must be mine.
I cut myself earlier.
Oh, yes? And where
did you cut yourself?
Leave me alone!
Bitch.
- I know a Franck Durin.
- Yes.
He lives just outside of town
on the way to Bonnieux.
Thank you.
Do you know if he lives alone?
Franck Durin's a bachelor.
He had a girlfriend, but she's long gone.
Anyone home?
Anyone home?
Yes?
Oh.
Hello, madame.
I'm looking for your husband.
I need to speak to him.
But I'm not married.
Doesn't marcel...
John Bosload's gardener, live here?
Yes. He's my daddy.
Pardon me.
- Is he home?
- No.
He's at the swiss people's house.
Would you tell him to call me?
- Yes.
- Thank you, madame.
But maybe I can help you?
- Do you know Julie?
- Yes.
she's pretty.
Do you have her mother's number?
It's important.
Julie's mother is dead.
What?
It was an accident.
Hello?
Could I speak toJohn Bosload, please?
It's sarah morton.
Okay then.
Please hurry. It's urgent.
I'm sorry, miss morton.
John's not available.
Well, where is he?
He's gone out.
Okay, bye.
You came back!
You came back!
I thought you'd gone!
I thought you'd abandoned me.
But you're here!
You're here! You came back!
Thank you, mummy!
aman.!
Julie!Julie, I'm not your mother!
Julie!
Julie!
Julie!
Come here. shh.
What happened?
Nothing.
You just fainted.
Everything's fine.
Oh, my head hurts.
ht.
o away.
Julie?
Yeah
You must tell me the truth.
I need to know.
About Franck?
Yeah.
I think I killed him.
I don't know.
For you.
For the book.
Hang on.
stop it!
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.
- Why are you leaving?
- shut up, and get off my back.
Get off me!
You're such a pain in the ass.
Are you done?
Yeah.
Okay, now-- No, no.
Get out.
Follow me now.
Ready?
You'll have to clean up behind.
Okay.
Don't forget.
Good. You've found them.
Yeah.
I'll take this.
Okay.
Come on. start digging.
I'm so tired.
Not surprising.
It's tiring to kill a man.
sarah?
sarah.
What?
Thank you.
All riht. that's done.
I'm going to bed now.
there's somethin
ot to burn.
What's that?
Your book.
It could be used as evidence.
Did you read it?
No, but I just can imagine.
Well, stop imagining, huh?
Get yourself to bed.
We got work to do tomorrow.
Listen. I've thought it over.
We have to carry on with our lives
as if nothing has happened.
You should call marcel and ask him
to come up this afternoon
to do some work.
Like cut the grass?
Why not?
It's important for everything
to appear normal...
as it was before.
Another thing, did anyone
see you with Franck before
the two of you came here?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I went to his house.
He lives in an isolated place
outside Lacoste.
And after, we came
directly here in my car.
Did anyone see you
along the way?
I don't think so.
Did he have any family?
No. His parents are dead.
Right.
Are you going back to London?
Not straightaway.
That would look suspicious.
Why are you helping me,
sarah?
Well, why wouldn't
I help you?
I don't know.
Do you think
they will arrest me?
No, not necessarily.
If you do exactly as I say,
I don't think there'll be any problems.
And why should I believe you?
Because you write about murders
in your books?
Absolutely.
marcel.
arcel.
sarah.
Oh.
It's you.
ood-bye.
want to let you finish your book.
I'm going to saint-Tropez.
A friend of mine has some work
for me in his restaurant.
It's possibly for the best.
Are you going to tell my father?
John? I've got nothing
to tell him.
You're right.
Good-bye.
Yeah?
How did you get that scar
on your stomach?
Is that for your book?
Yes.
A car accident.
Good luck.
You too.
don't really know
why  this.
but after eve
that happened between us.
it seems like the ri to do.
y mother's book
was not completely lost.
t did burn. but she kept a copy
which she ave to me.
have it.
ive you
these paes today.
e.
they inspire you.
take them. steal them.
they're yours.
ulie.
Yes, well.
I've read it.
I don't know what to say.
You didn't like it, did you?
I wouldn't say that, exactly.
Oh, come on,John.
stop beating around the bush.
Give me the truth.
Well, I don't understand
what you're trying to say.
And I don't recognize you in it.
I thought that's what you wanted.
You wanted something more personal.
Yes, I know, but I--
I don't think writing about feelings
is your strong suit.
murders, investigations,
that's your line of country.
I mean, this is far too subtle.
t's too abstract.
Where's the action
Where are the plot twists
so, what's your advice?
shall I burn it?
Oh, God,
you're so melodramatic. No.
But for the benefit of your career,
I don't think we should publish it.
ht now.
ell.
think o your audience.
It's funny. That's precisely
what I thought you'd say.
Well. there you are then.
ome on. You can do
better than this. arah.
Actually, I don't think I can.
I think this is the finest piece of work
I've done in a bloody long time.
And because I knew in advance
that you wouldn't like it,
I've taken matters
into my own hands...
and I've given you a surprise.
I've signed with Barken.
Unlike you, they love the book.
Why couldn't you
have told me?
There are a few things
that you couldn't tell me.
Keep the book.
Give it to your daughter.
I've signed it for her. Ciao.
Oh, by the way,
you can tell Terry Long's mother...
that Dorwell will be back
and he's in top form.
Good-bye, Debbie.
Bye-bye, sarah.
