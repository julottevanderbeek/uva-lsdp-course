That is a scary stack
of books.
Does Mommy have
to read all those?
Of course.
That's what you do
when you go
to law school.
Read books and
argue with people.
Hey, what's going on?
We suddenly having
a bowl shortage?
We're just trying to save
our natural resources.
This way, we only have
to wash the spoons.
Okay, girls, shut that off.
Grab your homework. Bedtime.
Hello.
Yes, hi.
I'm looking for a young college coed.
A law student named
Allison Dubois?
Smooth, Joe College.
So, are you on the plane yet?
Yes, we just boarded.
Hey, listen, I wanted to try
one more time to convince you
that you don't need to
pick me up in the morning.
I think you should focus on
your first day of school.
Well, that's awful thoughtful
of you, Daddy,
but it's been six days since
I've laid eyes on you.
I can't wait to see that tan
that you got in Hawaii.
Hawaii?
Is that where I was?
All I remember is the inside
of a military base.
Hey, girls, it's Daddy.
You want to say good night?
Night, Dad!
See ya tomorrow!
Love you, Daddy!
Sweet dreams.
Did you get that?
Loud and clear.
I'll see you in the morning.
Yep. I'll be the one who looks
like a first-year law student.
Hello.
Hey, it's me.
I'm sorry to call so early.
We picked up a tailwind,
so we're landing at 5:00
instead of 6:00.
So I already called
for the car service,
so you just go back to sleep.
Honey? Honey, what?
I just lost you for a second.
Sorry.
We just hit some turbulence
or something. Hold on, babe.
PILOT
At this time I'm going
to ask you to fasten
your seatbelts.
Joe, what's going on?
Is everything okay?
Uh, everything's fine, sweetie.
Just a little bumpy.
Joe, what's going on?
Talk to me!
I love you, Allison!
I love you very...!
Joe! Joe, Joe?!

Ladies and gentlemen
Today, the city of Phoenix
is presenting you
with an extraordinary
opportunity,
but it is also entrusting you
with a grave responsibility.
Luis Amenabar has been the head
of the Sola de Vega narcotics
cartel for over a decade.
And during that time,
he has ordered the execution
of dozens of men and women,
both here in Arizona
and in Mexico.
And then we go  into the list charges,
and the witnesses...
That's all right.
I just wanted to hear the
beginning. That's great!
That's really terrific.
I'm glad I got you, got you
to take a pass at writing it.
Well, I tried to make
it sound like you.
Oh, man, you did.
Hell, you know what?
I'm half-tempted to just
let you do it yourself.
You're the D.A.
I'm only the second chair.
Believe me, the jury wants
to hear it from you.
We're really doing this,
aren't we?
We're gonna put that
son of a bitch away.
I think we are.
Get a good night's sleep.
Court's in session
at 1:00.
I asked the judge
for a continuance.
Tomorrow's an important day.
I wanted you
to have some time.
Well, thank you.
Marie?!
Honey, I'm home.
Sorry I'm late.
I got hungry
and I couldn't wait.
Your trial's all over
the news.
I DVR'd the coverage
if you wanted to watch it.
No, that's okay.
I'm living it.
It's about as much of that
trial as I can take.
So, listen, honey,
court doesn't start
till 1:00 tomorrow,
so I figured we'd drive out
to Wood Lawn in the morning.
Seriously?
Seriously.
It's the anniversary
of your father's death.
We should get out
to the cemetery.
I just don't get
what the point is.
It's not like Dad is
really at Wood Lawn.
Look, Mom,
I'm just saying--
okay?-- Dad's plane
went down in the Pacific.
We buried an empty coffin.
Doesn't it seem silly to you
to go see him every year
when he's not really there?
Marie, it's your father.
His grave is his grave.
Mom, I'm not going this year.
What?
I'm not going.
Dad died
seven years ago, Mom.
I cried about it
every night for how long?
Six months? A year?
And all that time,
he never showed up.
Never said goodbye.
Dad knows who we are.
He knows what we can do.
He didn't have to disappear from
our lives just because he died.
No. He chose to.
Sweetness... Sweetie...
Hey.
I'm sure he had his reasons.
Come on, Mom.
You're not even mad at him
just a little bit?
You never wondered
why he died and just...
left us?
Miss you.
These are from Ariel and Dave.
I can't believe
you never met Dave.
You know, I told Ariel
not to get married
until she graduated
law school, but...
Of course, she ignored me.
Just like
we ignored our parents.
From Bridgette.
Oh, she changed her major again.
It's Creative Writing this time.
From Marie.
She's a teenager now.
She's a good kid.
She'll be okay.
She just misses her dad.
I miss you, too.
Let's all do our best to keep
this from turning into a circus.
Shall we?
Be seated.
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,
I'm required to remind you
that the defendant
is presumed innocent
until proven otherwise.
Good luck.
I hear
you're both quite good.
District Attorney Dennis Caruso
will handle opening statements
for the prosecution.
Mr. Caruso?
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, congratulations.
Today, the city of Phoenix
is presenting you with an
extraordinary opportunity.
Amenabar's attorney came to me
right after we adjourned.
Put a plea on the table.
They want to make a deal?
Why didn't you tell me?
Not worth discussing.
They offered to have him
plead guilty in Mexico.
We'd extradite him. He'd serve
a life sentence down there.
Problem is, is that
you know and I know
that he would
just keep running the show
from some
white collar prison.
and maybe bribe
his way out in a few years.
Like I said--
not worth discussing.
You should go home.
Have a drink.
Tomorrow morning, we'll keep
nailing him to the wall.
Tomorrow morning!
All right.
Mr. Mayor, can we
get a statement, please?
WOMAN 2: Will your office
be issuing a statement?
Mr. Mayor, any comment
on the slaying
of District Attorney Caruso?
Yes.
I have a comment.
I do.
Dennis Caruso was a friend.
Deputy Mayor DiNovi and I
respected him a great deal,
and our deepest sympathies go
out to his wife and daughters.
He said they wanted a deal.
That's... That's
the last thing he said to me.
He said
that Luis Amenabar's attorneys
wanted him extradited to Mexico
so that he could stand trial
there, and Dennis said "no."
Yeah, Maggie.
I'm sorry
to disturb you, Mr. Mayor,
but the Chief of Detectives
just arrived.
All right.
Send him in.
Hi.
Allison...
Do we know
anything new?
Security cameras
in the garage got nothing.
No one near
Caruso's car all day.
We're guessing the bomb
must have been planted
at some other location.
And no one's
officially taken credit
for what happened,
but, uh,
I think we all know
who's responsible.
Amenabar.
He wants us to know
he's still in control.
Would you two excuse us
for a moment, please?
Yeah.
Lynn's wrong.
Amenabar is not in control.
He wouldn't have done
what he did tonight
if he wasn't afraid.
I don't want him thinking
for even one second
that this is going to keep us
from sending him to prison.
I don't want him to think
for one second
that we're not going
to move forward with this trial.
I'd like you to think
about taking over for Dennis.
You built
this case.
There's no one
more equipped
to move this
forward than you.
If you tell me you'd rather not,
I won't hold it against you--
I'll even tell the media
it was my call--
but if you decide
to see this thing through,
then know that you,
Marie, Bridgette and Ariel
would have round-the-clock
protection
for the duration of this trial.
Amenabar's people
wouldn't be able
to get within 1,000 feet
of any of you.
The choice is yours.
Hey.
Mom, you okay?
I, uh...
I tried calling earlier,
but all I got
was your voice mail.
Listen, Ariel,
I need to tell you
about some things
that are going on here.
No. I understand.
You have to take over
first chair.
What... what other choice
is there?
I don't know.
I could have said no.
I could have let Mr. Devalos
hand the case over
to the interim
district attorney.
Okay.
But what kind of message
do you think that
would have sent to
the Luis Amenabars of the world?
I know. I'm just not crazy
about putting you
and your sisters
through all of this.
I just hate
that I can't do my job
without Mr. Devalos having
to put security details
on all three of you.
Mom, it's okay.
Seriously, we get it.
You know, Marie was so mad
at Daddy today.
She still can't forgive him
for not coming back.
And you know what? She's right.
He could come back
if he really wanted to.
He could tell me what to do.
Mom, what are you talking about?
I mean, he doesn't have to.
You know why?
Because we both already know
exactly what he would have said.
Make us proud.
The sign that I saw
was in Spanish.
I'm almost positive
it was Mexico.
And I know how
this sounds--
Joe surviving this
plane crash--
but it is not impossible.
At least not according
to the FAA investigator
who analyzed this crash
seven years ago.
Look. You see this?
This is where
the plane went down.
And with the wind
and the strong
water currents that day,
Joe could have just drifted
to one of these beach towns,
like Rosarito or Ensenada.
If he survived the crash.
If he survived the crash.
Look, sir...
I know you have
connections
in Mexican law
enforcement.
I was just hoping maybe you
could reach out to them,
see if maybe somebody remembers
seeing someone
matching Joe's description
washing up
on one of their beach towns
seven years ago.
Allison...
after my daughter,
Arianna, died,
there were times I swore
I saw her across a crowded room.
I heard her voice
right behind me.
This is not that.
And you, of all people,
should know.
I've been having these dreams
my whole life,
and they almost always lead me
to something that matters.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll call my friends in Mexico.
I'll forward them
whatever photographs of Joe
you think would be most helpful.
Thank you.
would you kindly identify
the men in this photograph?
Rico and Steban Treja.
And would you mind telling the
court how you know these men?
Because I killed them.
You killed them?
Why?
Because they were moving
into my territory,
trying to sell their merchandise
where they shouldn't have.
And when you say your territory,
don't you really mean
the Sola de Vega territory?
Sola de Vega,
the same narcotics cartel
that Luis Amenabar
has been running
for a little over a decade?
The same cartel that hired you
to execute their competitors
here in Phoenix
like the Treja brothers?
Well?
Your Honor.
Answer the question, Mr. Ruiz.
I killed the Treja brothers,
okay?
I went to prison for it.
What else do you want me to say?
I want you to say what you said
to the police
the night you were arrested.
I want you to say
that you were ordered
to execute the Trejas by someone
in Sola de Vega cartel.
And I want you
to identify the man
who gave you
that order personally.
No.
I was running
off my mouth.
I didn't take orders
from no one.
He's right here.
He's right behind that table.
Mrs. Dubois?
Would you care
to finish your thought?
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I'm suddenly--
I'm not feeling very well.
I-I would like to request
a short recess.
Let's call it lunch.
We'll resume at 2:00.
It's okay that
you're nervous.
Pardon me?
It's okay that
you're nervous.
It's a big case.
Mr. Amenabar, I really
don't think that your attorneys
will appreciate us talking
right now.
My lawyers do what I want.
I hear you're going
to be a grandmother.
Your oldest one, right, the
one that lives in Boston?
Believe it or not, I have
three little  myself.
They add years to your
life, Mrs. Dubois.
Hello.
Allison, I'm sorry
to bother you at home,
but I just heard back from the
last of my contacts in Mexico.
I'm afraid we've come up empty.
No one found any reports
of an injured man washing up
on a beach in the days
after Joe's plane went down.
I even had 'em search
the records for that whole year,
just to be sure.
I-I'm sorry, I know that's
not what you want to hear.
Your doctors called the station.
I just want to be sure
we get the story right.
So, according
to them,
you just woke up on
a beach two days ago.
You have no idea who you are,
no idea where you're from,
no clue how you
wound up in Mexico?
That's right.
I have a head injury.
My doctor...
I can't remember his name.
Dr. Aguilar.
Right,
Dr. Aguilar.
He says it may be permanent.
He doesn't know if I'll
ever get my memory back.
Please, I just want
to go home.
Okay, where
is home?
I don't know.
Can you help me?
Of course.
Of course we can help you.
We're the police;
that's what we do.
You just listen to your
doctors for now, rest...
and I'll come
see you soon.
English.
I don't want my
driver chatting
to anybody
about this.
Fine.
The story we heard
is accurate.
He has no idea who he is,
and the doctors think
the brain damage is bad.
Hmm.
I appreciate your hard work.
Mr. Amenabar, gentlemen,
thank you for coming
on such short notice.
Your office is bringing
an additional charge
against our client, Mrs. Dubois.
I don't see
as we had much choice.
Well, then I assume
that you've explained
to Mr. Amenabar the
reason for which
he's being deposed
this morning.
It's in respect to a new
charge of kidnapping,
unrelated to any of those
for which you're already
being prosecuted.
Amelia Cready.
Her father is Steven
Cready of Cready Oil.
Two years ago Amelia was
kidnapped and held for ransom.
Per her kidnapper's request,
her father wired $2 million
to an offshore account
and awaited his
daughter's safe return.
All he got for his money was
the location of her body.
Now, last night I received
an anonymous tip--
Ah, anonymous.
Mm.
--that you were the one
who ordered the kidnapping.
I am sorry, I've never heard
of this girl or her father.
Well, Mr. Amenabar,
let's just pretend that you did.
Okay.
So this person who contacted us
also told us
the name of the man
who actually kidnapped Amelia.
We know what he looks like,
we have a picture of him.
We just don't know
where to find him.
Now if you
are willing
to identify him,
tell us everything
that you know about him,
we might be willing
to not add this
to the list of charges
against you.
Why don't you take a look?
Gentleman, let me have a moment
alone with Mrs. Dubois, please.
Mr. Amenabar, I don't think
that's a very good idea.
There's guards
right outside the door.
You feel safe,
don't you, Mrs. Dubois?
Lawyers.
Hmm.
Do you play much poker?
No.
That's a shame,
because something tells me
that you'd be very good
at it if you did.
Mr. Amenabar, do you know the
man in this picture or not?
Ah.
You see what you just did,
looking away?
In poker, we call that a tell.
I know what a tell is.
And you did
the same thing to me
when you were telling me
all about the crime
that this man committed.
It was almost as if
you didn't believe it yourself.
I wonder why that is.
Maybe it's just because
I don't like looking at you.
Nah.
It's not that.
I think it's something else.
I think, Mrs. Dubois,
that maybe...
you're the one
who knows this man.
Can you tell me
where to find him, or can't you?
I could,
I don't think
either of us really believe
that you're looking
to arrest this man for murder.
Huh.
You know, now
that I take another look...
he does seem familiar.
Get me my extradition to Mexico,
and I'll tell you
exactly what you want to know.
Excuse me.
Just yesterday, you sat there,
and you told me this business
with Joe would not interfere
with your ability
to prosecute the Amenabar case.
Now you're saying
that we should take the deal
his people are offering?
I thought you understood.
I saw my husband
in a Mexican hospital
He has amnesia.
Amenabar paid a crooked cop
to bring him Joe
when he was released.
Okay, in the first place,
you didn't see it.
You dreamt it.
And in the second place,
why, Allison?
Please explain to me
why the head
of a Mexican drug cartel
would buy a man with amnesia?
Any man, much less Joe?
I don't know!
I just know that he did it.
I could see it in his eyes
when I saw him this morning.
This morning
when you fabricated the story
about us bringing an additional
charge against him.
Do you realize you could have
put our entire case in jeopardy?
My  is alive!
And that is
that matters now!
Listen to yourself, Allison.
It doesn't make any sense.
Joe survives a plane crash
from seven years ago?
He drifts to Mexico?
He crosses paths
with Luis Amenabar,
the same man
you're prosecuting today?
I know how it sounds.
No, I don't think you do.
Did it ever occur to you
that Amenabar is playing you?
The man runs
an organization larger
than most Fortune 500 companies.
He's no fool.
You said that you
could see in his eyes
that he knew Joe.
What do you think he sees
in  eyes?
Don't you think that maybe,
just maybe,
that Amenabar knows
that Joe means something to you?
Don't you think
that it's possible
that he's just telling you
what you want to hear?
He's not telling me
what I want to hear.
He's confirming what I know.
I saw Joe yesterday.
I saw him when I looked
at Amenabar in court.
Because they're connected.
Because Amenabar can lead me
to Joe.
No, he can't,
and I won't make this deal.
Mr. Knox, you kept
the books for the Sola de Vega
cartel, is that correct?
Uh, that's right.
And during the time
that you were acting
as their accountant,
you were frequently asked
to enter expenses under
the miscellaneous supplies
category.
Is that right?
Uh, yes.
And yet, you understood
that those expenses
were for something other
than miscellaneous supplies,
didn't you?
You already answered
this question
when we deposed you
in exchange for immunity.
If you prefer,
I could read it into the record.
No.
All of the book entries
were in code.
They had to be that way.
The men I worked for...
they told me that
miscellaneous supplies meant
money they spent
when they had someone murdered.
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.
My apologies.
Where did you get this?
Get what?
Counsel, what's going on?
Where is he?
Where's my husband?
- Counsel!
- Where's Joe?!
Counsel,
you will come to order,
or you will be held in contempt.
I'm calling a recess.
I want to see counsel
from both sides
in my chambers
immediately.
Allison,
sorry to ring your bell so late,
but there's something
I need to discuss with you.
You're replacing me
as lead counsel?
Allison...
whatever you're going through,
it's affecting our chances
of convicting Amenabar.
We can't afford another day
like you had today.
But, sir,
Amenabar knows where Joe is.
He showed me a picture of him,
a photograph.
I heard all about it,
but it doesn't prove anything,
Allison.
Amenabar knows
you're vulnerable,
and he's using it
to fluster you.
I've told Judge Malone
we're bringing in new counsel.
She's granted us a 48-hour stay.
I'm sorry.
You've done exceptional work,
but someone else is going
to take it from here.
WOMAN
turn of events in Phoenix today,
as lead prosecutor
in the Luis Amenabar trial,
Allison Dubois,
was asked to step down.
Asked for comment,
Mayor Manuel Devalos
would only say
that the A.D.A. was taking
a leave for personal reasons.
Danny Boy.
Hey, Eduardo.
You made some good time, amigo.
Yeah.
I brought you some tacos.
Oh, no, no.
In case you were hungry?
No, no, it's okay. I got
something on the road, so...
I was just listening
on the radio about Mr. Amenabar.
It sounds like things are going
a little better for him.
Those people in Phoenix--
they don't know what
they're talking about.
Mr. Amenabar is a good man.
If he wasn't,
I would have put him in
jail a long time ago, no?
Yeah.
Are you okay? You look, uh...
you look tired.
No. I'm not tired.
I just...
I was just having a hard time
sleeping last night.
I... I kept having this dream.
This... this blonde woman.
Ah. I had that
dream, amigo.
Yeah.
I know that woman.
It wasn't like that.
No. What was it like?
Ah, I don't know.
It was just nice.
We had a house.
I think we were married, because
there were three daughters.
Three girls that we had.
And they looked like her.
Been having that dream
a lot lately.
Kind of makes me wonder...
About what?
I don't know. About my accident,
my memory loss.
I'm trying to figure out
if maybe she was someone
that I knew before.
Look, I don't know what
to tell you, Danny.
I'm the one who
caught your case
when you washed up on
that shore that day.
And I'm the one
who figured out
that you worked for Mr.
Amenabar before you got hurt.
So, I probably know more
about you than you do.
Uh.
I'm going to tell
you right now.
You ain't never
been with no blonde.
You sure as hell
don't have no family.
Allison.
It's 6:30 in the morning.
What are you doing here? I...
I thought we both agreed
you'd take a little time off.
We did. And I am.
Joe's alive.
I met with Luis Amenabar.
He confirmed it.
You met with Amenabar?
He's been using Joe
as a drug mule
for the last seven years.
A friendly American face
that can go back and forth
across the Mexican border
without arousing suspicion.
Joe doesn't understand.
He thinks he's just been
running errands for Amenabar.
He doesn't realize
those cars are filled
with compartments
that hold narcotics.
I see.
Now, assuming all of this
is true, why do you think
Amenabar would suddenly be
so forthcoming about Joe?
Sir, I came here
because I wanted to apologize
for my behavior yesterday.
You have always been
a good friend to me,
and I'm very grateful,
and I wanted you to know that.
Allison.
You haven't answered
my question.
Why would Amenabar tell you
about Joe?
Take care of yourself, sir.
Allison!
Allison!
Hello?
How far away
from City Hall are you?
I'm right... I'm right outside.
What's going on, Lynn?
Well, apparently,
Allison Dubois had a meeting
with Amenabar and his attorneys
late last night.
She agreed
to the extradition deal.
Her only condition was that
she get a five-minute meeting
with Amenabar in private.
It's over, Manny.
They're flying him to Mexico
this afternoon.
She torpedoed the case.
Are you really gonna not
talk to me the whole way?
Just don't, okay?
Don't what?
Don't act like
this is just some road trip
and everything is totally
normal, because it's not.
You threw away your career
this morning.
You threw away your life.
You threw away my life.
My friends. My school.
Why would you do that?
I did it to save our family.
Yeah. You just keep
telling yourself that.
Excuse me?
Can I help you?
You... you recognize me,
don't you?
You see me
in your dreams.
Our girls. Our home.
Do we know each other?
We do.
It's been...
It's been a long time,
but we do.
Your name isn't Danny.
It's Joe.
It's Joe Dubois.
And I'm Allison.
I'm your wife.
We have three daughters.
Ariel,
and Bridgette,
and Marie.
Allison.
Allison.
Please, you have
to stop this.
You have to wake up now.
I'm sorry.
You got confused.
That's not what I
wanted to happen.
Oh...
Joe. Oh, my God. You're back.
I just had
the most horrible dream.
Please, don't.
Why?
What's wrong?
Why can't I give you a hug?
You can't.
The plane, Allison,
the one I was taking
back from Hawaii,
something went wrong
with one of the engines.
No.
No, no.
No, this is... That's...
This isn't right.
This... That can't be right.
It is.
I didn't make it, Allison.
None of us made it.
I'm so sorry.
Stop saying that.
Do you hear me?
I-I want to wake up now.
I want to wake up
and find you beside me.
I want to hold you.
I'd like that, too,
but you're not going to
wake up from this, Allison.
This isn't a dream.
The dream was everything
you just went through.
No!
I sent it to you.
I was trying to show you
how things could be.
I was trying to show you
that, in spite of this,
you could still have
an amazing life.
That you could
be a lawyer.
That the girls could
turn out great.
I wanted you to see
how happy you could be,
but something happened.
You took over somehow.
Even in a dream, you couldn't
accept that I was gone,
so you brought
me back to life.
You, Allison.
You made it so that
you'd find me in Mexico.
You made it so that we
could be together again.
But we can't.
Because things like that
only happen in dreams.
This is going
to be hard.
This is going
to be awful,
and it's going to be
awful for a long time,
but you will get past it.
Everything we have
built, our life,
you'll keep it
going without me.
I can't. I can't.
I need you, Joe.
Who's gonna walk Ariel down the
aisle when she gets married?
Who's gonna get Bridgette and
Marie through being teenagers?
Who's going to...
Who's going to talk to me
at night before I fall asleep?
You and me...
we've been together
for-for so long
I don't even know if there
is a "me" without you.
There is.
I'm not just saying that.
I've seen it.
I love you, Allison.
I'll always love you.
Never forget that.
Please, my love.
Please. I love you.
Don't leave me.
Please!
Please, please!
Don't leave me. Please stay.
GIRL
Hi, Great-Grandma.
It's me. Glimmer.
I haven't seen you
since Christmas.
Do you remember
what I look like?
I worry you won't know it's me,
'cause I'm taller now.
How's the weather there?
It's cold here.
Every time it snows,
Mommy laughs.
She says when she was my age,
she would dream about snow.
Did Mommy tell you I'm having a
Sleeping Beauty birthday party?
All my friends are going
to sleep over,
and we're going to have
birthday cake for breakfast.
Do you think
you'll be able to come?
You can help me blow out...
Oh, no.
Hi.
You waited.
Of course.
You ready?
Do I get a kiss?
From now until
the end of time.
