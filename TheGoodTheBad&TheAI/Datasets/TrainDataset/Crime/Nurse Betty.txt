SPONGE.
A LITTLE QUICKER.
VITALS STABLE AND HOLDING.
CLOSE HER UP, WILL YOU ?
DAVID ?
THERE HAS BEEN A TRAIN CRASH
OUTSIDE SANTA BARBARA.
THEY'RE FLYING
AN AORTAL TRAUMA HERE NOW.
HOW CAN I ASK YOU THIS,
DAVID ?
I CAN DO IT, BLAKE.
IS HE CRAZY, JASMINE ?
HE'S BEEN ON HIS FEET
FOR 14 HOURS.
CHLOE, IT'S BEEN THIS WAY
SINCE LESLIE DIED.
LOSING HIMSELF
IN HIS WORK, POOR THING.
THIS IS GETTING
A LITTLE RECKLESS, DON'T YOU THINK ?
I DON'T THINK
HE HAS A CHOICE.
HANG ON A SECOND, JASMINE.
IT'S NOT LIKE HE HAS TO DO IT.
WELL, WHO ELSE
AT LOMA VISTA CAN DO IT ?
- WHO ELSE CAN DO
WHAT DAVID CAN DO ? - TRY LONNIE WALSH--
AND HE WOULDN'T EXPECT
TO BE KNIGHTED FOR IT.
BLAKE, I CAN HANDLE
THAT TRANSPLANT.
WE NEED SOMEBODY
WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF EXPERIENCE, LONNIE.
EVEN IF HE'S FALLING ASLEEP
ON HIS FEET ?
IT'S A COMPLICATED
PROCEDURE, LONNIE.
...FRESH OUT
OF MEDICAL SCHOOL.
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR,
BUT YOU'RE NOT DAVID RAVELL.
MISS ?
MISS ?
HE WILL BE
HELD PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE...
YOU SEE THAT ?
-
FOR THE FAMOUS
DR. DAVID RAVELL ?
A REASON TO LOVE WILL CONTINUE AFTER THESE MESSAGES.
SKIM, RIGHT ?
HALF A PACK ?
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S REALLY FATTY.
OUR COOK USES JUNK.
YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T
RATHER TRY A TURKEY BURGER ?
YOU SURE YOU WANT A TIP
WHEN I'M DONE ?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S YOUR BODY.
- WESLEY !
- OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'VE TOLD HIM
THE SAME THING, MA'AM.
THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION.
NO PROBLEM.
HI, GUYS.
HERE YOU GO.
- HELLO, BETTY.
- HI, ROY.
- YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.

HEY, YOU KNOW, I REALLY
ENJOYED YOUR EDITORIAL THIS MORNING.
WELL, THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.
I WAS REALLY TRYING
TO GET THE WHOLE HISTORY...
OF THE EPISCOPALIAN CHURCH.
OH, IT WAS GREAT.
REALLY, IT JUST
PUT THE WHOLE IDEA...
OF THE CHURCH BAKE SALE
IN PERSPECTIVE.
SO, SHERIFF,
HOW IS EVERYTHING ?
YOU KNOW, THE USUAL--
KEEPING THE WORLD SAFE.

HMM !
SHE'S COMING.  SHE'S COMING.
-
SURPRISE ! - OH !
HAPPY BIRTHDAY !
WHERE'D YOU GET IT ?
THAT'S SO EMBARRASSING.
- ON THE GODDAMN INTERNET,
WHERE ELSE ? - COME ON, POSE WITH HIM, BETTY.
OKAY.
A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR THOSE NURSING CLASSES YOU BEEN WANTING TO TAKE.
BUT KEEP PUTTING OFF,
THANKS TO A CERTAIN HUSBAND WE WON'T MENTION.
- OH, YOU GUYS, I CAN'T.
- TAKE IT.
I CAN'T.
BETTY.
THANKS, YOU GUYS.
YOU'VE REACHED SIZEMORE MOTORS,
HOME OF THE BEST
SELECTION OF USED CARS IN THE BIG SPRINGS-FAIR OAKS AREA.
WE CAN'T COME TO THE PHONE
RIGHT NOW,
'CAUSE WE'RE OUT MAKING A SALE,
SO LEAVE US A MESSAGE.
BETTER YET, COME ON DOWN
AND STEAL ONE OF THESE BEAUTIES RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER US.
COFFEE'S ALWAYS ON.
HI, DEL.  IT'S ME. I GUESS YOU'RE BUSY,
BUT I WANTED TO KNOW
IF I COULD TAKE ONE OF THE NEW BUICKS TONIGHT.
SO CALL ME, UM--
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
OH, UH, HI.
HANG ON A SECOND THERE, BABY.
YOU'RE THERE.
WHAT DO YOU NEED ONE OF THE NEW BUICKS FOR ?
YOU SOUND OUT OF BREATH.
I RAN BACK IN TO GET THE PHONE.
OH, WELL, UM--
JOYCE.  JOYCE.
SUE ANN IS TAKING ME OUT,
AND, UH, I JUST THOUGHT
IT MIGHT ME NICE...
TO GO IN A NEW CAR.
- WHAT WAS THAT ?
- NOTHING. YOU KNOW, IT'S BUSY HERE.
WELL--
YOU DON'T NEED A LeSABRE TO GO OUT WITH SUE ANN.
- I DON'T  ONE, BUT--
- TAKE THE BLUE CORSICA.
WELL, ONCE HE DUMPS HER,
WE WILL.  RIGHT.
OH.  HOLD ON A SECOND.
HE'S OUT PRICING BANNERS,
BUT I DON'T EXPECT HIM BACK. OH.
BANNERS ?
YOU KNOW, FLAGS AND SHIT.
FOR A LIVELIER LOOK,
HE SAID.
- OH.
- OH !
IT'S A SHAME
ABOUT THE LeSABRES.
- THEY'RE A REAL SWEET RIDE.
- YEAH.
HOW ARE THINGS
AT THE TIP TOP ?
OH, THEY'RE FINE.
YEAH, FINE.
YOU, UH--
YOU EVER MISS IT ?
YOU... MUST BE KIDDIN'.
OH.  YEAH.
OKAY.
HI.  YEAH.
YEAH, MM-HMM.
HI.
DID YOU WATCH IT YET ? HI.
I SURE DID.
IF THAT MAN GOT ANY BETTER LOOKING,
IT WOULD BE A CRIME
OF SOME SORT.
I KNOW.
OKAY, YOU READY ?
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR TONIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO THE STARLIGHT
IN STYLE.
OH, BETTY.
OKAY, I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.
YOU SQUINT YOUR EYES
AND IT LOOKS JUST LIKE A JAGUAR.
I AM SO SORRY.
I WAS GOING TO CALL YOU.
LARRY'S GOT A LODGE MEETING.
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN GET A SITTER THIS FAST.
I FEEL AWFUL.
THAT'S OKAY.
MAYBE NEXT WEEK WE CAN
GO BOWLING OR-- YEAH.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
YEAH.
THAT'D BE GREAT.
WELL, THANKS.
OKAY, WELL,
HAVE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
OKAY ?
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
I'D BETTER...
GO START DINNER.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
MM-HMM.
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ANY SALAD ?
NO, I DON'T WANT
ANY SALAD. OKAY.
OKAY.
WHAT WAS ALL THAT SHIT ON THE PHONE...
ABOUT THE BUICKS ?
HERE YOU GO. I TOLD YOU.
SUE ANN WAS GOING
TO TAKE ME OUT, BUT--
WHAT, SHE'S
NOT COMFORTABLE IN A CORSICA ?
ACTUALLY, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE GOING OUT TONIGHT.
OH, YEAH ?
SOME SERIOUS CLIENTS--
WITH REAL POTENTIAL.
OH.
SO, UM,
WHO ARE THESE CLIENTS ?
COUPLE OF GUYS IN
FROM OUT OF TOWN.
THEY WANT TO SEE
THE NEW LeSABRES.
NEW LeSABRES ?
JESUS CHRIST.
LOOK AT THESE GUYS.
WHO ARE THEY FUCKIN' ?
YOU KNOW THESE ACTORS
ARE MAINLY MODELS-- WHICH ARE MAINLY FAGGOTS.
- OH ?
-
KNOW WHAT BUGS ME MOST
ABOUT THOSE SOAPS ?
- HMM ?
- IT'S PEOPLE WITH NO LIVES...
WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE'S FAKE LIVES.
YEAH, WELL,
NOTHIN' LIKE WATCHING
THE TENPINS FALL, HUH ?
HEY, THAT'S A SKILL.
THEY'RE TRYING
TO GET THAT IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA GO OUT. CLEAN THIS SHIT UP.
I TOLD HIM MY CAR'S
IN THE SHOP.
- HE SAID HE'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE
ME A RIDE HOME TOMORROW. - YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
I'VE GOT SOME SPECIAL PLANS FOR YOU AND I--
THINGS COMING UP
IN THE NEAR FUTURE I THINK YOU'LL LIKE.
HMM.  MM-HMM.
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
THEIR OFFENCE SUCKS.
YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST
DAMN RUNNING BACKS IN THE WORLD,
BUT SOMEBODY'S
STILL GOTTA BLOCK FOR THEM. YOU'RE 100% RIGHT THERE.
LET'S HAVE SOME MUSIC.
YOU GUYS LIKE MUSIC ?
...TO SEE HOW FAST THIS BEAUTY WILL GO, THOUGH.
I GUESS SOMEHOW
THAT SPEED HELPS ME FORGET THE PAST.
LISTEN, DAVID.
I KNOW I'VE SAID IT BEFORE,
BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU AGAIN...
HOW SORRY I AM
ABOUT YOUR WIFE.
- WELL, WE SHOULD PROBABLY--
- LET'S NOT GO.
NOT YET.
YOU GOT A FINE ONE
RIGHT HERE.
YOUR WIFE
IS VERY ATTRACTIVE, DEL.
- HAVE I SEEN HER BEFORE ?
- IF YOU ATE AT THE TIP TOP, YOU DID.
OH, YEAH.
YEAH-- THE COFFEE.
YEAH.  BETTY POURS
A MEAN CUP.
LET'S SIT IN HERE.
WHEN SKIPPER DIED, IT HURT SO BAD...
I JUST WANTED
THE WORLD TO GO AWAY.
TO A SUCCESSFUL TRANSACTION.
WE ARE WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.
AND IF YOU FEEL SOMETHING...
FOR SOMEONE, YOU SHOULD--
PLEASE !
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T
FIND YOU ATTRACTIVE.
I'M JUST NOT READY.
NO, HE'S NOT READY.
NICE PLACE YOU GOT HERE, DEL.
REAL COMFORTABLE.
SWEET LITTLE TOWN,
FAIR OAKS.
DO YOU LIKE IT ?
- IT'S A SMALL TOWN, MAN.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DEL ?
- JUST A BUNCH OF DUMB FUCKS.
- REALLY ?
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.
COULD YOU GIVE US
AN EXAMPLE ?
OF WHAT ?
I'M ASKING FOR AN EXAMPLE
OF ONE OF THESE DUMB FUCKS BEING A DUMB FUCK.
- I DON'T FOLLOW.
- YOU'RE NOT A DUMB FUCK, ARE YOU, DEL ?
- NO.
- SO, GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE...
OF A STUPID PERSON
DOING A STUPID THING.
NOT BEING STUPID YOURSELF,
YOU'RE EQUIPPED TO KNOW.
- RIGHT ?
- ARE WE GONNA GET DOWN TO BUSINESS HERE OR NOT ?
JUST GIVE ME
ONE EXAMPLE.
-
- OKAY.
OKAY.
BURGER KING OPENS UP.
THESE ASSHOLES GET EXCITED
AND START LINING UP...
LIKE THEY'VE NEVER
SEEN ONE BEFORE--
LIKE IT'S SOME KIND
OF FIVE-STAR RESTAURANT.
- FIVE STARS ?
-  YEAH.
HOW ABOUT IT, WESLEY ?
- THAT SOUND STUPID TO YOU ?
- NO, THAT'S IGNORANT.
- MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE US
ANOTHER EXAMPLE. - THIS IS BULLSHIT.
CAN WE GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS HERE, PLEASE ? JESUS CHRIST !
- HE'S WAITING.
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
- I DON'T KNOW.
"INJUNS" ARE STUPID. -
- "INJUNS" ?
- DEL, DID YOU JUST SAY "INJUNS" ?
INDIANS, INJUNS, WHATEVER.
I MEAN, THEY'RE ALWAYS
GETTING DRUNK AND DOING STUPID SHIT.
- LIKE WHAT ?
- PUKING ON THE SIDEWALK-- STUPID SHIT !
LET'S SEE.
AROUND HERE, THAT WOULD BE KIOWA,
KICKAPOO AND OSAGE.
AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT ?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- YOU DON'T KNOW ?
DEL,
MY IDEA OF STUPID'S
DIFFERENT FROM YOURS,
SO HERE'S HOW
THIS IS GOING TO WORK.
TAKE YOUR SOCKS OFF.
-
-
HEY, COME ON.
I'M SORRY.
IT'S MY FAULT.
I THOUGHT YOU FELT
SOMETHING FOR ME.
CHLOE,
YOU'RE WONDERFUL.
YOU ARE.
I JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S...
SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL
OUT THERE FOR ME.
NOW, DEL, I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT STUPID IS.
STUPID IS TAKING WHAT
DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU.
- ISN'T THAT RIGHT, WESLEY ?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
STUPID IS TRYING TO SELL IT
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE,
BY THEIR VERY NATURE,
UNTRUSTWORTHY.
- THAT IS SO RIGHT.
- STUPID, DEL, IS CALLING PEOPLE IN KANSAS CITY...
WHO ARE AFFILIATED
WITH THE RIGHTFUL OWNERS OF THE THING YOU STOLE...
AND TRYING TO SELL IT TO THEM.
NOW, THAT'S REALLY STUPID.
YOU KNOW, DEL,
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO,
THAT REMARK YOU MADE...
ABOUT THE NATIVE AMERICANS
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN YOU SCALPED.
RIGHT HERE
WHERE YOUR HOUSE IS.
- YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SCALPED.
- HELL OF A WAY TO DIE.
NAH, WESLEY,
IT WASN'T ALWAYS FATAL.
WE COULD SCALP OLD DEL
RIGHT NOW,
AND HE'D BE PLENTY ALIVE
TO TELL US WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS,
TAKE A KNIFE AND-- DEL.
- COME ON, NOW.
WE'RE JUST TALKING HERE. -
COME ON.  JUST TAKE A KNIFE,
AND YOU MAKE...
A MARK ACROSS THE FRONT
OF THE FOREHEAD,
GRAB A HANDFUL OF HAIR
AND CUT AS YOU PULL.
IT'S AMAZING HOW EASILY
THE SCALP COMES OFF.
A MARK, HUH ?
IT'S OKAY, DAVID.
I MEAN, WHAT DO I KNOW ? SHH.
A WOMAN GETS IN YOUR CAR,
YOU TAKE HER FOR A RIDE IN THE WOODS--
- WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS WAS YOUR IDEA. - WHO'S DRIVING THE CAR, DAVID ?
- WHAT ?
- DOES IT REALLY MATTER...
- WHO SAID WHAT ?
- OF COURSE IT MATTERS.
NOW I WANT TO KNOW
THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR WRONGDOING.
I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT
WHAT YOU'VE STOLEN,
- AND, OF COURSE,
WHERE IT IS NOW. -
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD,
I DIDN'T TOUCH IT. I SWEAR TO GOD !
ALL RIGHT THEN.
CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY, DEL.
LUCKIER THAN THOSE INJUNS
YOU'VE GOT SUCH CONTEMPT FOR.
IF ANYBODY GOT A RAW DEAL,
IT WAS THE AMERICAN INDIAN.
THE COUNTRY HAS A BLACK MARK
ON ITS SOUL FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.
I'LL COME RIGHT TO THE POINT.
CHLOE JENSEN HAS FILED CHARGES
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST YOU.
FUCKING CHRIST, WESLEY !
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR FUCKING MIND ?
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG
WITH YOU ?
WHAT THE FUCK
IS YOUR PROBLEM ?
GET RID
OF THAT FUCKING THING. GET RID OF IT !
THEN, I CAN FORGET.
YOU EVER FEEL LIKE SOMETHING
REALLY SPECIAL WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO YOU, JASMINE ?
FUCKING GREAT, WESLEY !
NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE STUFF IS.
-
WHY'D YOU SHOOT HIM ?
I HAD TO SHOOT HIM,
WESLEY.
IT WAS THE ONLY
DECENT THING TO DO-- AFTER YOU SCALPED HIM !
I JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL--
- ...REALLY SPECIAL
OUT THERE FOR ME. - VERY UNPROFESSIONAL, WESLEY !
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
OR WHO IT IS.
I JUST KNOW
THAT SINCE LESLIE DIED, I'VE HAD THIS FEELING.
I JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL...
OUT THERE FOR ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
I JUST KNOW THAT SINCE LESLIE DIED,
I'VE HAD THIS FEELING.
BETTY !
BETTY.
HEY, BETTY.
HI.
- ARE YOU OKAY ?
- I'M GREAT.
I WAS KIND OF WONDERING...
IF I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
WELL, I SAW THE WHOLE THING.
IT WAS DISGUSTING.
- REALLY ?
DID YOU SEE WHO DID IT ? - MM-HMM.
YOU DID ?  WHO WAS IT ?
IT WAS CHLOE.
YOU GUYS WANT TO TRY
STEPPING DIRECTLY IN THE EVIDENCE, PLEASE ?
ROY OSTREY !
YOU AND YOUR GODDAMN
POLICE SCANNER.
I LEAVE HERE
FOR TEN MINUTES--
BETTY, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS.
OH, IT'S NO PROBLEM.
WELL, BYE, ROY.
NICE TO SEE YOU, SHERIFF.
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.
WHERE THE HELL
IS SHE GOING ?
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU KNEW DEL WASN'T LYING.
I SAW HIS SOUL, WESLEY.
THE MAN WAS FACE TO FACE
WITH HIS GOD.
NOBODY LIES
IN THAT SITUATION.
YOUR LITTLE GERONIMO ACT
RATTLED ME,
AND I ABANDONED
MY INSTINCTS.
NEVER ABANDON
YOUR INSTINCTS. I DIDN'T.
YOU GAVE ME A LOOK.
WHAT FUCKIN' LOOK ?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DONE
SO I OFFED HIM.
WELL, I WASN'T DONE.
I WAS JUST TIRED OF HEARING HIM WHINE.
AND YOU DIDN'T
OFF ANYBODY, BUDDY. YOU SCALPED HIM.
JESUS, I ALMOST PUKED.
DID I TELL YOU THAT ?
THEN WHY'D YOU TELL ME
THE FUCKING INDIAN STORY ?
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN, WESLEY ?
IF I TOLD YOU A TY COBB STORY,
WOULD YOU HAVE TAKEN A BASEBALL BAT...
AND BEATEN HIM TO DEATH ?
YOU--
GODDAMN !
- YOU GONNA JUST LEAVE
THE CARS LIKE THIS ? - YEAH, WHY NOT ?
IT'LL CONFUSE 'EM.
GOTTA DO SOMETHING,
NOW THAT YOU'VE FUCKED IT UP.
I DIDN'T FUCK NOTHIN' UP.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE A STATEMENT.
TRYING TO MAKE
A STATEMENT.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
IN THIS BUSINESS,
YOU DON'T PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE...
UNLESS THE PHONE RINGS.
THE PEOPLE WHO
GET THE CALLS ARE GOOD-- NOT FLASHY, GOOD.
THEY GET IN, THEY GET OUT,
NOBODY KNOWS A GODDAMN THING.
YOU UNDERSTAND ?
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
THREE IN THE HEAD,
YOU KNOW THEY'RE DEAD.
THAT'S A GOOD MOTTO.
WELL, I'LL GET YOU A BUMPER STICKER.
YOU BETTER START BELIEVING IT.
THAT'S THE ONLY STATEMENT YOU NEED TO MAKE.
LET'S GET
THIS THING DOWN. THANK YOU.
PSST.
I QUESTIONED JOYCE
ABOUT ALL THIS. YEAH ?
IT SEEMS SHE WAS
PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH OLD DEL--
ON A REGULAR BASIS,
IF YOU GET MY DRIFT.
AND HALF THE OTHER GUYS
IN THIS TOWN, INCLUDING YOURSELF, I BELIEVE.
JUNIOR YEAR.
ANYWAY, SO WHAT ?
SO, SUPPOSE BETTY
FOUND OUT ABOUT THEM.
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT BETTY SIZEMORE--
OUR BETTY SIZEMORE,
WHO YOU WENT TO SWING CHOIR WITH--
HIRED SOMEBODY TO SCALP
HER HUSBAND...
IN HER KITCHEN,
WHILE SHE WATCHED ?
- IT'S JUST A THEORY.
- OH, YOU'RE AMAZING, ELDEN.
JUST BECAUSE I'M THINKING IT
DOESN'T MEAN I LIKE IT.
SO ?  HOW IS SHE ?
SHE'S IN A KIND OF SHOCK.
I SEE SIGNS OF A POST-TRAUMATIC
REACTION WITH POSSIBLE DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS.
- COULD I HAVE THAT
IN AMERICAN ? - IT'S A KIND OF ALTERED STATE.
IT ALLOWS
A TRAUMATIZED PERSON TO CONTINUE FUNCTIONING.
- SO SHE DID WITNESS IT ?
-
GOOD NIGHT.
SUE ANN, I GOTTA
TELL YOU SOMETHING.
A BAD THING HAPPENED
TO DEL AND ME.
YEAH, HON.
WHY DON'T YOU GET SOME SLEEP.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.
OH, I KNOW.
AND I'M REAL SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.
BUT I JUST KNOW THERE'S
SOMETHING SPECIAL OUT THERE FOR ME.
DEAR DEL.
THIS IS THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DONE,
BUT I NEED TO BE HONEST.
ADMIT IT, DEL--
WE'VE GROWN APART, AND YOU DON'T SEEM HAPPY ANYMORE.
AS FOR ME,
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER...
GIVEN MYSELF A CHANCE.
BUT I WANT TO TAKE
THAT CHANCE NOW.
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU.
BETTY.
THIS IS BAD, WESLEY.
THIS IS VERY, VERY BAD.
- THIS IS EXTREMELY BAD.
- HMM ?  WANT SOME BACON ?
I DON'T THINK YOU
APPRECIATE THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION HERE.
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT WE DON'T
HAVE WHAT WE CAME FOR.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE THE HELL IT IS.
NOW THIS.
THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY LAST JOB.
I EVEN PUT DOWN A DEPOSIT
ON MY BOAT.
HOW IN THE HELL CAN YOU EAT
AT A TIME LIKE THIS ?
I GET NAUSEOUS
JUST WATCHING YOU.
WELL, I CAN EAT
BECAUSE I KNOW WE DIDN'T KIDNAP NO WOMAN.
AND I CAN EAT
'CAUSE I'M FUCKIN' HUNGRY.
SHE GOT OUT OF TOWN
AWFUL QUICK.
AND WASN'T SHE QUIET
IN THAT HOUSE ?
- MM-HMM.
- I THINK MOST WOMEN WOULD HAVE SCREAMED, DON'T YOU ?
I KNOW THEY WOULD HAVE.
YEAH.
WE COULD BE DEALING
WITH A CUNNING, RUTHLESS WOMAN HERE.
UH, MRS. ROGERS ?
YES.
HOW YOU DOING ?
DWIGHT CAMPBELL, MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE.
I'M LOOKING
FOR A BETTY SIZEMORE. I WISH I COULD HELP YOU,
BUT I CAN'T.
GO TO YOUR ROOM.
NOW.
PRECIOUS, AIN'T THEY ?
YOU KNOW, SHE HAS
A SUBSTANTIAL DEATH BENEFIT...
COMING TO HER
FROM THE TRAGIC LOSS OF HER HUSBAND.
DOES SHE HAVE ANY RELATIVES
IN THE AREA ? NO.
WELL, SHE DOES HAVE
SOME GRANDPARENTS...
DOWN IN OKLAHOMA,
BUT THAT'S IT.
SO ARE YOU IN TOUCH
WITH MRS. SIZEMORE ? NO.
BUT I AM TAPING
HER SHOW FOR HER.
HER SHOW ?
YEAH--
DID CHLOE TESTIFY ?
SHE'S BEEN WORKING HERE
HOW LONG ?
FIVE YEARS, GIVE OR TAKE.
- YOU TWO IN HIGH SCHOOL
TOGETHER ? -
AREN'T YOU A SWEETHEART.
NO, NOT QUITE.
ANYWAY, SHE'S BEEN WITH US
QUITE A WHILE.
- BUT SHE WANTED MORE
OUT OF LIFE, HUH ? - NO, SHE JUST WANTED...
SOMETHING OUT OF LIFE--
ANYTHING.
- WHO IS THIS GENTLEMAN ?
- THAT'S JUST A CUT-OUT.
- THAT'S A GAG WE DID
FOR HER BIRTHDAY. - DO YOU MIND IF I KEEP THESE ?
IF IT'LL HELP BRING HER BACK,
PLEASE BE MY GUEST.
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T
GET THE WRONG IDEA ON THE PHONE, LONNIE.
OH, I DON'T THINK SO,
CHLOE.
BUT WHEN THEY CALL CHLOE JENSEN
TO THE STAND, JUST SAY WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY.
YOU MEAN I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO SWEAR ? ON A BIBLE ?
RELAX.
IT'S A HEARING.
BUT THEY ARE GONNA
ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.
YOU'RE INTO  TOO ?
-
- WHAT CAN I GET YOU ?
- A LITE BEER, PLEASE.
COME ON, CHLOE.
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL,
INTELLIGENT, SEXY WOMAN. THANK YOU.
WITH A TORN BLOUSE.
YOU CAN'T LOSE.
-   OOH.
-
IF IT'S LONG DISTANCE,
YOU CAN LEAVE ME A BUCK WHEN YOU'RE DONE.
THANKS.
HELLO ?
SUE ANN.
BETTY !
HI.  JUST CALLING
TO TELL YOU THAT I'M FINE.
OKAY, WHERE ARE YOU ?
I'M IN THE...
CANYON RANCH BAR,
IN, UM--
WILLIAMS.
IN WILLIAMS, ARIZONA.
SO I GUESS
I'M HALFWAY THERE. HALFWAY TO WHERE ?
YOU'VE GOT TO COME HOME.
WE'VE BEEN REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU, YOU KNOW.
SUE ANN, I THOUGHT
YOU'D BACK ME ON THIS.
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS
WITH DEL.
HOW DID HE TAKE MY NOTE ?
LISTEN TO ME.
A NICE MAN CAME BY
FROM MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE.
HE SAYS YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF MONEY COMING TO YOU FROM DEL'S POLICY.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?
- DEL'S  POLICY. ARE YOU WITH ME ?
- OH--  I'VE GOTTA GO.
- NO.  BETTY, LISTEN TO ME.
DEL IS DEAD.
WHAT DID I EVER DO TO HER ?
IT'S WHAT
YOU DIDN'T DO, BUD.
SO WHERE YOU HEADED, BETTY ?
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.
AND YOU CALLED YOUR FRIEND,
AND SHE'S TELLING YOU NOT TO GO ?
WHEN I WENT TO EUROPE,
MY FRIENDS TOLD ME I WAS CRAZY.
EUROPE ?   EUROPE ?
GOD, THIS IS MY FIRST TIME
OUT OF KANSAS.
I SHOULD CALL YOU
DOROTHY.
WHEN I FIRST LEFT HERE,
I WENT STRAIGHT TO ITALY.
EVERYONE TOLD ME NOT TO GO,
BUT, OH, I WANTED TO GO TO ROME--
EVER SINCE
I SAW AUDREY HEPBURN IN
AND GODDAMN IT, I WENT !
- DID YOU LOVE IT ?
- ROME WAS THE BEST THING I EVER DID--
BECAUSE I DID IT.
I SWEAR TO YOU,
IT CHANGED ME.
I'VE BEEN TO ROME, ITALY.
AND I SAT EVERY MORNING
IN THE CAFE SISTINA,
AND I DRANK MY CAPPUCCINO
AND I--
I WATCHED THE PILGRIMS
WALK TO MASS.
NO ONE CAN EVER
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME.
I LEFT MY HUSBAND
THREE DAYS AGO.
- REALLY ?
- YEAH.
I'M GETTING BACK
WITH MY EX-FIANCE.
HE PROPOSED TO ME
RIGHT AROUND HERE,
SO I GUESS THIS IS
KIND OF A SENTIMENTAL STOP.
WHEN I WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL
I ASKED MY MOTHER
WHAT WILL I BE
WILL I BE PRETTY
WILL I BE RICH
HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID
TO ME
QUE SERA, SERA
WHATEVER WILL BE
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE BEEN OUT OF KANSAS.
WELL, I MEAN EXCEPT FOR THEN.
I'M TRADING IN A CAR DEALER
FOR A HEART SURGEON.
- SO THAT'S NOT TOO BAD, HUH ?
- THAT'S SMOOTH.
- CEDARS SINAI ?
- NO, NO, NO. LOMA VISTA.
I SUPPOSE HIS NAME
IS DAVID RAVELL.
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT ?
- WHAT'S HIS REAL NAME ?
- IT'S DR. DAVID RAVELL.
BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW ?
DO YOU MEAN GEORGE McCORD,
THE ACTOR ?
NO.  NO, NO, NO.
DAVID RAVELL.
HE'S A HEART SPECIALIST.
I KNOW.
WE JUST WATCHED HIM.
YOU'RE SERIOUS.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
FIND HIM, BETTY ?
WELL, I'LL--
I'LL GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
WHAT IF,
WHEN YOU GET THERE,
NOTHING'S LIKE YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS GONNA BE ?
WELL, THIS IS THE BIGGEST THING
THAT I'VE EVER DONE.
AND I HAVE TO DO IT.
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, BETTY.
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'VE MADE IT THIS FAR.
BETTY IS A BIG FAN
OF THE SOAP OPERA A REASON TO LOVE.
- LOOK.  THAT'S IMPORTANT.
-
HE TOLD YOU
TO DO THIS, HUH ? NO !
NO.  I SAW, ON TELEVISION,
CHLOE AND LONNIE. THEY'RE TELEVISION CHARACTERS.
RIGHT.  AND-AND BETTY
IS IN LOVE WITH DR. DAVID RAVELL.
RIGHT !  RIGHT !
FROM THE SHOW.
WHAT IF SHE'S IN LOS ANGELES,
LOOKING FOR HIM ?
- THE ACTOR, I MEAN, NOT THE--
- THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD.
IT'S DUMB ?
WHY DID BETTY CALL SUE ANN FROM ARIZONA YESTERDAY ?
- YEAH, SHE CALLED ME YESTERDAY.
- SAID SHE WAS IN ARIZONA, DID SHE ?
-   YES !
-
- THIS WOMAN IS ON THE RUN.
- COME ON, ELDEN.
-
TO CALL THE LOS ANGELES
POLICE DEPARTMENT ? YOU HAVE GOT TO DO THAT !
HEY !  I'M THE LAW.
I AIN'T GOTTA DO NOTHIN'.
THAT'S BETTY WHEN SHE WAS 12.
VERY GRACEFUL.
YEAH.
SUCH POISE TOO.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU, MA'AM.
NOW, DID SHE EVER GIVE YOU
ANY INDICATION THAT SHE MIGHT LEAVE HER HUSBAND ?
SHE PUT UP WITH THINGS
THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE.
AND YET SHE,
OF ALL PEOPLE, DEFENDED HIM.
THAT'S WHY
WHAT THAT SHERIFF SAID MADE ME ANGRY.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
- IF ANYONE PAID TO HAVE...
THAT HUSBAND OF HERS KILLED,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ME.
THAT YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER
IS ALIVE,
AND SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE KILLING OF DEL SIZEMORE.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE MISSING
A PIECE OF YOUR SOUL TO KILL SOMEONE.
THAT'S NOT OUR BETTY.
WHY DO YOU SAY YOU'VE GOT TO BE
MISSING A PIECE OF YOUR SOUL TO KILL SOMEBODY ?
BECAUSE IT'S NOT NATURAL,
YOUNG MAN.
IT'S VERY,
VERY NATURAL TO KILL. ALL SPECIES KILL.
SEE, GOD KILLS.
YOU SAYING THAT GOD'S
MISSING A PIECE OF HIS SOUL ?
HE LOVES HIS JOB.
LOVES HIS JOB.
MATTER OF FACT,
HE'D LIKE TO KILL ALL THE CRIMINALS HIMSELF.
LET ME JUST
ASK YOU THIS.
IF BETTY WAS RUNNING
FROM SOMEONE,
WHERE DO YOU THINK
SHE'D GO ?
OF COURSE, I DON'T KNOW EVERY DOCTOR THAT WORKS HERE.
BUT DR. RAVELL IS THE FINEST
SURGEON ON THE STAFF.
YOU MUST KNOW HIM.
HE'S REALLY HANDSOME.
AND HE'S GENTLE
AND CONSIDERATE.
HE'S BEING SUED
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT.
- WHAT ?
- WELL, HE DIDN'T DO IT. HE WAS SET UP.
WELL, I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE
HEARD ABOUT THAT.
OF COURSE,
HE'S ONLY HERE TWICE A WEEK.
HE'S ALSO ON STAFF
OVER AT LOMA VISTA.
I DON'T THINK
I KNOW THAT HOSPITAL.
OH, IT'S THE ONE
IN THE REALLY PRETTY AREA,
WITH THE PALM TREES
OUT FRONT AND THE MOUNTAINS IN THE BACK.
YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED
ALL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
HMM.
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T EVEN
CONSIDER YOU...
WITHOUT REFERENCES
AND A RESUME.
AND FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU COULD HAVE FORGOTTEN THEM.
- HI.
- WHO--
WHO ARE YOU ?
BETTY--
NURSE BETTY.
HOLD IT, HOLD IT !
- HELP US !
PLEASE, SOMEBODY ! -
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING ?
GET OUT OF THERE !
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME !
MY BROTHER IS DYING !
DROP YOUR WEAPON ! HI.
- LET'S SEE.
ARE YOU CHOKING ? -
OKAY, LET ME--  LET ME LOOK.
OH !
HE HAS THE--
HE HAS THE THINGY !
THE-THE AIR IN THE HOLE !
HE HAS TOO MUCH AIR
AROUND THE HEART AND THE LUNGS,
SO I HAVE TO OPEN--
I HAVE TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE...
SO HE CAN BREATHE.
NO, I HAVE TO DO THIS
OR HE'LL DIE.
IT'S OKAY.
I'VE SEEN IT DONE ONCE.
HERE WE GO.  READY ?
SEE ?  WASN'T SO BAD.
IS HE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT ?
WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR HIM.
YOU SHOULD
THANK THAT NURSE FOR WHAT SHE DID.
IRIS--  WHO IS
THAT REMARKABLE NURSE ?
WHAT YOU DID YESTERDAY
WAS RECKLESS AT BEST.
YOU ARE NOT AN EMPLOYEE
OF THIS HOSPITAL.
- YES, MA'AM.
- GOOD.
BECAUSE I'M PREPARED
TO OFFER YOU A JOB.
BUT YOU ARE NOT
TO TOUCH ANYONE.
IS THAT TOTALLY CLEAR ?
WELL, HE'S DOING FINE.
AY, GRACIAS A DIOS.
YOU'RE FROM HERE.
NO, I'M FROM KANSAS. I JUST DROVE IN.
WHY DID YOU COME
TO L.A. ?
I CAME FOR LOVE.
MY EX-FIANCE LIVES HERE, SO--
I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW
WHERE HE IS JUST YET,
SO I'M AT A MOTEL
AROUND THE CORNER.
ROSA--
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD--
YOU GET USED TO IT.
OH, PRETTY.
YEAH, I GOT THIS APARTMENT WITH A GUY.
THE GUY YOU WERE
TELLING ME ABOUT ?
OH, NO.
THIS ONE WAS WORSE.
I HAD TO HAVE
THE PLACE SPRAYED WHEN HE LEFT--
TWICE.
HE WAS TWO
BEFORE THE LAST ONE,
NOT COUNTING A LITTLE
OFFICE THING IN THERE--
WHICH I'M TRUSTING YOU WITH,
'CAUSE IF IT GETS OUT,
I'M ON THE STREET,
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING ?
OH, WOW.
THIS IS NICE !
YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST
FISH DON'T PEE ON THE SEAT.
JUST ONCE I WISH
I'D RUN INTO A GUY...
WHO WOULD NOTICE THEM
BEFORE MY TITS.
COME ON.
I WILL SHOW YOU TO YOUR ROOM.
OKAY.
YES.
I UNDERSTAND.
SO WHAT'D THEY SAY ?
THEY SAID FIND IT--
FIND HER.
FINISH THE JOB WE WERE PAID TO DO.
- HALF.
- WHAT ?
THEY ONLY PAID US HALF,
SO THEY STILL OWE US THE OTHER HALF.
OH, GODDAMN, WESLEY.
THERE YOU GO AGAIN !
THE SAME LOUSY-ASSED ATTITUDE
THAT GOT US HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THAT "MAKE A STATEMENT,"
DO AN END ZONE DANCE,
SHAKE YOUR ASS AND SUE
EVERYBODY IN SIGHT ATTITUDE...
THAT'S DRAGGING THIS WHOLE
FUCKING COUNTRY DOWN THE DRAIN !
YOU GET PAID
WHEN A JOB IS DONE.
- AND WE HAVEN'T DONE
THE GODDAMN JOB ! - I KNOW THAT.
TURN OFF THAT GODDAMN MUSIC !
DO I DESERVE THIS ?
IN THE TWILIGHT OF MY CAREER,
DO I DESERVE THIS ?
I DON'T THINK SO.
I NEVER TOOK OUT ANYBODY THAT DIDN'T HAVE IT COMING.
I'M A FUCKING PROFESSIONAL !
AND WHERE AM I ?
PURGATORY !
YOU'RE IN TEXAS.
I AM VERY TIRED.
I'VE WORKED HARD,
AND MY WORK SHOULD BE OVER, BUT IT'S NOT.
THIS FUCKIN' JOB
IS JUST BEGINNING.
BETTY, BETTY, BETTY.
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH
THAT PRETTY LITTLE HEAD OF YOURS ?
EVERYONE SAYS,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET MARRIED,
THIS IS THE SPOT TO FIND SOMEONE.
OH, YEAH ?
YEAH.
LUCKILY FOR ME, I'M OFF MEN,
SO I HAVE THE LUXURY OF NOT GIVING A SHIT.
MMM.
YOU KNOW, THE MORE
I THINK ABOUT IT,
DAVID PROBABLY
WOULDN'T COME HERE.
I MEAN, HE'S STILL
GETTING OVER LESLIE AND EVERYTHING.
WHO IS LESLIE ?
HIS WIFE.
HE HAS A WIFE ?
OH, NO--
SHE DIED IN A CAR WRECK
LAST YEAR--
DECAPITATED.
GOD, THAT'S AWFUL !
I KNOW.
THEY'RE NOT EVEN SURE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT...
'CAUSE THEY NEVER
FOUND HER HEAD. HER HEAD ?
MM-HMM.
YOU ARE MAKING THIS ALL UP.
OH, NO, NO.
SEE, SHE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR...
WITH A RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT,
AND THEY THINK HE WAS
MIXED UP IN THE MAFIA OR SOMETHING.
AY, DIOS.
AND I THOUGHT MY LOVE LIFE WAS CRAZY.
SO, WE'LL START
AT THE LIBRARY FIRST,
AND WE'LL FAN OUT
FROM THERE.
THEY'VE GOT
ALL THE L.A. PHONE BOOKS, PLUS MEDICAL DIRECTORIES,
THINGS LIKE THAT.
OKAY.  OKAY.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET HIM
HIDE FROM YOU ANY LONGER, ALL RIGHT ?
ALL RIGHT.
I AM GOING TO MAKE THIS
MY PERSONAL MISSION.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
DOING ALL THIS FOR ME, ROSA.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU GET YOUR...
FAIRY TALE ENDING,
OR WHATEVER.
AT LEAST ONE OF US SHOULD.
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- DAVID RAVELL.
-
LOMA VISTA ?
DAVID RAVELL ?
- HI.
- GUESS WHO I SAW TODAY.
- WHO ?
- DR. DAVID RAVELL.
- YOU'RE KIDDING !  WHERE ?
- ON TELEVISION.
REALLY ?
CUT THE SHIT, WILL YOU ?
EITHER YOU'RE MAKING A FOOL
OUT OF ME...
BECAUSE YOU GET OFF ON IT,
OR YOU GOT SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS.
SO WHICH ONE IS IT, BETTY ?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, ROSA ?
I'M TALKING
ABOUT DR. DAVID RAVELL.
I KNOW.
I HEARD YOU, BUT I--
YOU HAVE A THING
FOR AN ACTOR...
ON SOME STUPID WHITE SOAP OPERA,
AND WE SEARCHED ALL OVER TOWN FOR HIS CHARACTER.
NOT THE ACTOR--
WHOSE REAL NAME IS GEORGE, BY THE WAY--
BUT HIS CHARACTER, BETTY.
ARE YOU HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN ?
ROSA--
I TRUSTED YOU, BETTY.
I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL.
HE IS REAL.
YOU NEED SERIOUS HELP.
I BET SHE'S NICE
AND COMFORTABLE IN THAT AIR-CONDITIONED CAR.
YOU DON'T LOOK
ALL THAT COMFORTABLE HERE THOUGH, BABY.
'CAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
BEING THE CENTER OF ATTENTION, DO YOU ?
NAH.  YOU'RE LIKE ME.
YOU SMOKIN' ?
HUH ?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU ?
WHAT THE FUCK, WESLEY !
THAT WAS A SHITTY THING
TO DO !
I'M SICK OF SEEING
HER FUCKING FACE !
I WILL SHOOT THAT BITCH
LIKE SHE'D SCRATCHED MY CAR !
NOW, DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
MY LAST ONE.
MY FINAL TARGET.
HEY--
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU'RE SPECIAL ?
HUH ?  DON'T YOU KNOW
THAT YOU REPRESENT SOMETHING ?
WHAT ?
WHAT ?
WHAT DOES SHE
REPRESENT ?
WHAT DOES SOME SKINNY
WHITE BITCH FROM KANSAS,
WHO'S DRAGGING
OUR ASS UP AND DOWN THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE,
WHAT DOES SHE REPRESENT ?
TELL ME.
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING.
CHARLIE !
THEY FOUND HER IN VEGAS !
PERFECT DESCRIPTION.
SAYS SHE'S WITH THE BUYER
THAT DEL LINED UP.
- HOW'D THEY DESCRIBE HER ?
- YOU KNOW-- BLONDE, THIN, WHATEVER.
WELL, NOW--
BLONDE, THIN, YEAH.
DID THEY SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT STYLE ? DID THEY MENTION GRACE ?
HEY.
HEY.
THIS IS CRAZY.
I COME HOME, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM.
YOU GO TO THE KITCHEN,
I GO TO MY ROOM.
CAN--
CAN WE BE FRIENDS ?
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE THOSE ?
- HEY, LOOK, LOOK.
-
I'M TALKING ABOUT ONE
OF THE SEVEN NATURAL WONDERS OF THE WORLD HERE.
YOU WANNA SEE
THE GRAND CANYON AT NIGHT ?
SHIT AIN'T GRAND.
IT'S BLAND.
WHAT THE HELL DOES IT MATTER ?
- SHIT.  SHE WASN'T
IN KANSAS CITY. - I KNOW.
SHE WASN'T IN DALLAS OR HOUSTON
EITHER.  WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA BE IN VEGAS ?
THINK SHE'S GONNA BE
WAITING THERE WITH TASSELS ON HER TITTIES ?
NO.
LISTEN.
"WHEN I GROW UP,
I'M GOING TO BECOME A NURSE OR A VETERINARIAN.
"I ALWAYS WANTED
TO HELP PEOPLE...
AND VALUE ALL LIFE,
BE IT ANIMAL, PLANT OR MINERAL."
- NOW, THAT SOUND LIKE
A SHOWGIRL TO YOU ? - KEEP TURNING THE PAGES.
I'M SURE SHE BLOWS
A FEW STRANGERS BEFORE THE BOOK IS DONE.
- YOU SOUND LIKE
A FUCKIN' MADMAN. -
YES, I'M AN AMERICAN.
AND NO, I'M NOT GOING TO THE FUCKIN' BLAND CANYON.
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.
ASSHOLE.
- WHAT'S UP ?
- MR. CAMPBELL ?
- HUH ?
- IS THIS MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE ?
-
MY NAME'S SUE ANN ROGERS.
I'M BETTY SIZEMORE'S FRIEND. I'VE HEARD FROM HER.
YEAH ?
SHE WAS AT A BAR IN ARIZONA.
DON'T YOU KNOW
I WAS YOURS
FROM THE VERY DAY
THAT YOU HAPPENED
TO COME MY WAY
CAN'T YOU SEE
I'M UNDER YOUR SPELL
BY THE LOOK IN MY EYES
CAN'T YOU TELL
CAN'T YOU TELL
NOW, DON'T YOU KNOW
EVERY BEAT OF MY HEART
THANK YOU.
KEEPS CRYING OUT
- WHAT THE FUCK ?
-
-
-
- COME HERE !
-
DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD TIME ?
YOU MAKE A WISH ?
GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR BLACKNESS ?
FOUND YOUR BETTY.
WELL, AT LEAST WHERE
SHE'S BEEN HANGING OUT.
WHERE ?  WHERE IS SHE ?
NOT TELLING YOU.
WHAT ?
I'M NOT TELLING YOU
TILL YOU STRAIGHTEN OUT.
DANCING AROUND LIKE FUCKIN'
BOJANGLES OUT THERE-- WHAT THE FUCK ?
THIS SHIT'S GOTTA STOP,
AND I MEAN IT.
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
GO IN AND SIT ?
NO.  I WAS THINKING WE
COULD JUST STAY OUT HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE...
AND MINGLE
A LITTLE BIT. OKAY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WELL, I'M GLAD TO BE HERE.
OH, SURE, ABSOLUTELY.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
HMM ?
OVER THERE.
WELL ?
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR ?
TALK TO HIM, HUH ?
YOU CAME 1500 MILES
FOR THIS.
YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS. HE'S GOT HIS OWN COMPANY.
I MEAN, HE'S THE GUY
YOU WANTED TO TELL.
DO I KNOW YOU ?
OF COURSE.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ?
- I-I TAKE IT I SHOULD.
- SILLY.  IT'S ME.
WE WERE ENGAGED.
- YOU WERE ENGAGED.
-
I-I BEG YOUR PARDON ?
LETTING YOU GO,
THAT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.
AND IT'S A MISTAKE
I'VE HAD TO LIVE WITH FOR SIX YEARS,
BUT I'VE PUT IT BEHIND ME NOW,
AND I JUST HOPE THAT YOU CAN PUT IT BEHIND YOU TOO.
I'VE MISSED YOU.
I'VE  YOU, DAVID.
THAT'S... VERY NICE.
THAT WAS VERY GOOD.
I GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT.
WOW.  THAT WAS--  WOW.
GOOD.
THEY DAY I LEFT YOU,
I JUST DROVE AND DROVE.
I DROVE ALL DAY
AND ALL THAT NIGHT.
I JUST KEPT DRIVING.
I STOPPED AT THIS OLD COUNTRY CHURCH,
AND THE PASTOR LET ME IN,
AND I SAT--
IN THE VERY FIRST PEW,
WHERE WE WOULD'VE SAT ON OUR WEDDING DAY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I REMEMBERED THAT.
ALTHOUGH I SHOULD.
I WROTE IT.
BUT THAT WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO,
AND YOU'RE QUOTING IT VERBATIM.
I'M... FLATTERED,
I THINK.
- OR FRIGHTENED.
-
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?
BETTY SIZEMORE. WHAT'D YOU WRITE ?
I'M LYLA BRANCH.
I'M THE PRODUCER.
UH-HUH.
I HAVE TO ADMIT, YOU HAD ME GOING THERE.
YOU'RE BETTER THAN MOST OF THEM ANYWAY.
YEAH.
DO YOU HAVE A HEAD SHOT ?
WAIT A SECOND.
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, BETTY ?
ARE YOU SURE YOU--
WELL, WHY NOT ?
WHAT--  WHAT DOES
HAPPEN NEXT, BETTY ?
WELL, DAVID CAME OUT TO,
UH, DO HIS RESIDENCY,
AND THEN HE MET LESLIE--
WE KNOW ALL THAT.
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, BETTY.
OH.  OH.  WELL--
I MARRIED A CAR SALESMAN.
REALLY ?
YOU WERE--
YOU WERE DUMPED FOR A CAR SALESMAN, GEORGE.
- WHY'D YOU CALL HIM
"GEORGE" ? - WHY DID I CALL HIM--
YEAH, DAVID,
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
WELL, YOU'RE, UM--
YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT,
UH, FRED THERE.
DEL.
DEL.  DEL.  YEAH.
UH, DEL.
HE WAS AMAZING.
OH, YEAH.
HE WAS, I MEAN, THIS GUY--
TALK ABOUT SALESMEN,
HE COULD SELL ANYTHING TO ANYBODY...
AT ANY TIME, AMAZING.
YOU KNOW DEL ?
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT DEL AND I GO WAY BACK.
WE WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
HE SAVED MY LIFE.
- OH, MY GOSH.
- LIKE, TWO MORE MINUTES IN THAT FREEZING-COLD WATER,
AND I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WOULD'VE DROWNED, BUT--
- DEL.
-
DEL JUMPED IN AND HE
GRABBED ME AND HE JUST, HE PULLED ME OUT.
-
- IT WAS AMAZING.
PULLED HIM--
HOLD ON. I'M HAVING A MOMENT HERE.
I LOST TOUCH WITH HIM
AFTER THAT, BUT... I STILL OWE HIM.
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING.
THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
THAT'S FUNNY.
IT'S JUST WHAT I WAS THINKING.
I KNOW !
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT HURT ME...
TO HEAR THAT
YOU MARRIED HIM. OH, I'M SO SORRY.
I TRIED TO TELL MYSELF,
AT FIRST, IT WAS FOR THE BEST,
THAT THERE WAS SOME
SORT OF REASON FOR IT, BUT DEL ?
I WAS YOUNG
AND-AND STUPID AND SCARED.
- YOU NEVER EVEN
GAVE US A CHANCE. - I KNOW.
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY TIMES I-I TELL MYSELF THAT SAME THING.
I'M--  ARE YOU REALLY CRYING HERE ?
I'M JUST--
I WAS KINDA PLAYING ALONG.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
GEORGE ?
WHY DOES HE KEEP
CALLING YOU GEORGE ?
I DON'T KNOW.
DAVID IS A VERY BUSY MAN,
SO WE REALLY HAVE TO GO.
NOW.
IT WAS A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU. BYE.
WE GOTTA GET TO THIS,
UH, PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT.
BUT, UH--
OH.
IT WAS GOOD.
IT WAS SO GREAT.
ALL RIGHT.
UH, I WOULD BE HONORED
IF YOU'D JOIN US.
WHAT... AN IDEA.
I'M SURE YOU TWO
HAVE A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO,
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
HOLD ON A MINUTE.
THANK YOU.
HEY, THANKS, MAN.
I LOVE YOUR WORK.
OH, THANK YOU.
THANKS A LOT.
HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE !
WHAT'S LONNIE
DOING HERE ?
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ?
- LATE, AS USUAL.
I KNOW.
WHY ARE YOU GUYS LEAVING ?
- WE DID OUR 20 MINUTES.
- OH.  WHO'S THE SKIRT ?
APPARENTLY, SOMEBODY
WHO DOESN'T LIKE TO BE REFERRED TO AS A "SKIRT."
YOU !
RELAX.  SHE DIDN'T EVEN
GET YOU THAT HARD.
- DO I KNOW YOU ?
- NO, BUT I KNOW JUST WHO YOU ARE.
THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THE KIND OF PLACE BETTY WOULD COME TO.
MAYBE SHE HAD
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
I MEAN, SHE DOES PEE,
DOESN'T SHE ?
OR IS SHE
TOO POISED TO PEE ?
HEY.  BE CAREFUL WITH THAT.
WHAT CAN I GET YA ?
WE'RE FEDERAL MARSHALS,
MA'AM.
WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR
THIS YOUNG LADY.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.
YOU SURE HAVE !
- SHUT UP, MERLE.
- BETTY ! HER NAME IS BETTY.
I'VE NEVER SEEN
THAT WOMAN BEFORE, AND NEITHER HAS MERLE.
HE DRINKS TOO MUCH.
AND DON'T TRY TO TELL ME YOU'RE COPS.
I WAS MARRIED TO A COP
FOR NINE YEARS. YOU'RE NOT COPS.
- MOTHERFUCK !
-
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ? SHUT UP !
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
FORTHCOMING WITH US.
SO LYLA'S VERY NICE.
REALLY TALL.
YES, SHE IS.
YOU KNOW, SHE SAID
SHE THOUGHT THAT I WAS CHARMING AND RELENTLESS.
SHE SAID THAT I WOULD
GO FAR IN THIS TOWN.
OH, AND SHE SAID THAT,
UNLIKE MOST CHARMING AND RELENTLESS PEOPLE SHE KNEW,
SHE LIKED ME.
WELL, SHE'S
A GOOD PERSON TO KNOW.
SO,
WHERE DID YOU
STUDY AGAIN ?
CARLTON.
OH.
CARLTON SCHOOL OF NURSING.
BUT I ONLY WENT
FOR TWO SEMESTERS THOUGH. OH.
'CAUSE DEL--
AH, RIGHT. OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
I THINK YOU SET
THE OFFICIAL RECORD...
FOR STAYING IN CHARACTER
ABOUT THREE HOURS AGO NOW.
YOU JUST SAID THAT TO ME TWO HOURS AGO.
OHH--
IS IT HERE ?
MM-HMM.
WELL, GREAT.
GOSH.  I HAVEN'T BEEN
THIS HAPPY SINCE I WAS 12.
OKAY, I'LL BITE.
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE 12 ?
I TOOK MY MOM TO KANSAS CITY
FOR MOTHER'S DAY,
AND I USED THE ALLOWANCE
I WAS SAVING.
WE WENT TO LUNCH AT SKIES--
THIS RESTAURANT
AT THE TOP OF A BUILDING,
AND YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE WORLD
FROM UP THERE.
IT WAS
OUR LAST SPECIAL THING...
'CAUSE SHE DIED THAT YEAR.
IT WAS A GREAT DAY.
YOU JUST... GAVE ME
GOOSE BUMPS FROM THAT, YOU KNOW THAT ?
THAT IS
JUST GREAT IMPROV.
I JUST WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE PERFECT BETWEEN US.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
LISTEN, LET'S, LET'S-- TIME, HERE.  LET'S--
CAN WE TALK SERIOUSLY
FOR... JUST A MINUTE ?
- UH-HUH.
- I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANT THIS, BETTY,
AND YOU ARE GIFTED
AND EXTREMELY DETERMINED,
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,
IT IS NOT ENTIRELY UP TO ME.
I KNOW.  IT'S UP TO US.
I LOVE YOU, DAVID,
AND I WANT TO SEE YOU
TOMORROW AND THE NEXT DAY...
AND THE NEXT DAY
AND THE NEXT.
OH, YOU SCARED ME.
MM-HMM.
- STILL IN LOVE ?
- MM-HMM.
THIS ISN'T FAIR,
YOU KNOW.
DO YOU ALWAYS GET
WHAT YOU WANT ?
- ALMOST NEVER.
- BUT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T EXIST.
YOU COME OUT HERE,
YOU MEET THIS GUY WHO SHOULD LAUGH IN YOUR FACE.
INSTEAD,
YOU LEAVE WITH HIM.
YOU'RE, LIKE,
ONE OF A KIND.
THANKS.
IT WAS A TOTALLY REJUVENATING, SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE.
I KNOW.  I WAS THERE.
I'M NOT DENYING
THAT SHE'S GOOD. THANK YOU, LUPITA.
YOU KNOW SHE GOT A JOB
AS A NURSE ?
METHOD ACTRESS ?
DAVID RAVELL--
HE'S GETTING BORING.
- WE KNOW THAT.
-
WHO'S A TWIN WHO'S EVIL ?
NO !  WE DID THAT
WITH LONNIE.  REMEMBER THE BLIND ONE LAST YEAR ?
- HE GOT THE EMMY THING
FOR THAT ? - YEAH.
I THINK WE JUST
BRING BETTY DOWN...
AND JUST THROW HER
INTO THE SET AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
- I DON'T KNOW.
- I MEAN, I TELL THE CAST AHEAD OF TIME.
- I MEAN, THEY'D ALL BE PREPPED.
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'D BE LIKE LIVE TELEVISION.
I MEAN, LET'S LIVE ON THE EDGE A LITTLE BIT HERE.
COME ON, LYLA !
WE COULD BREAK THE MOULD.
I SAID
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
NOW, LET ME TELL YOU WHY I KNOW SHE'S LYING.
FIRST PLACE,
BETTY WOULD NEVER FALL FOR A SOAP STAR.
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT BARTENDER SOUNDED VERY SERIOUS.
BETTY'S HERE ON BUSINESS.
IT'S THE BIGGEST MARKET
FOR WHAT SHE'S SELLING.
WAIT, HOLD UP, HOLD UP.
THAT DON'T MAKE NO SENSE.
WHAT DOESN'T MAKE NO SENSE ?
WELL, YOU OBVIOUSLY BELIEVE THE LADY.
SHIT, WE'RE ALL THE WAY
HERE IN L.A.
SO YOU BELIEVED HER ENOUGH
TO COME THE FUCK OUT HERE.
IF YOU BELIEVED HER THAT MUCH,
NOW WHY IS THE REST OF HER STORY SUDDENLY BULLSHIT ?
- I JUST DON'T BUY IT.
- DON'T BUY IT.
CALL IT INSTINCTS.
CALL IT 35 YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL KNOW-HOW.
I CALL IT NUTTY AS MY SHIT
AFTER I EAT AN ALMOND ROCA.
YOU NEED TO REMEMBER
WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.
I NEED TO GET
MY FUCKIN' HEAD EXAMINED !
YOU CAN'T RULE SOMETHING OUT
JUST 'CAUSE YOU GOT A WHIM OR THOUGHT THE BITCH WAS FINE !
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR WHIMS
ALL ACROSS AMERICA.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I AM FUCKIN' TIRED ! WESLEY--
IT'S BENEATH HER ?
THE BITCH IS A FUCKIN' HOUSEWIFE !
AIN'T NOTHIN' BENEATH HER !
SO CHECK THIS OUT.
WHAT KIND OF CAR DOES JASMINE DRIVE ?
UH, MERCEDES, I THINK.
BLACK.
SO IS SHE AS FINE IN REAL LIFE
AS SHE IS ON THE SHOW ?
- BETTER.
- MMM !  GODDAMN.
WHY DON'T YOU
HELP A BROTHER SNEAK ON THE LOT ?
SURE.
GOOD LOOKIN' OUT, BABY.
GOOD LOOKIN' OUT. ALL RIGHT, NOW.
BLACK MERCEDES.
LOOKIN' FOR A BLACK MERCEDES.
IT'S GOT TEN KILOS.
BLONDE, GREAT FIGURE.
SORT OF A WHOLESOME
DORIS DAY THING GOING.
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
DORIS DAY.
YEAH, YOU COULD SEE HER
WORKIN' AT THE U.N. OR SOME PLACE LIKE THAT.
U.N.
UNITED NATIONS, MAN.
WHERE--  NEVER MIND.
HI.  BETTY THERE ?
YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE YOU DO ON TV.
YOU MUST BE ROSA.
I'M GEORGE McCORD.
I'VE HEARD
SO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOU.
HMM.  NOT AS MUCH AS
I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU.
THESE ARE FOR YOU.
HI.
OH, THAT'S NICE.
WELL, I SEE
YOU'VE MET DAVID.
YEAH, I SURE DID.
FUNNY THING, BETTY.
HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF
TO ME AS GEORGE.
OH, YEAH.
HE DOES THAT.
HALF THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM
CALL HIM GEORGE.
I DON'T THINK
YOUR FRIEND ROSA LIKES ME VERY MUCH.
OH, SHE'S PROBABLY
JUST JEALOUS.
SHE GETS
A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT MEN.
UM, SO WHERE
ARE WE GOING ?
WELL, FIRST I WAS THINKING
ABOUT PATINA, AND THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT THE IVY,
AND THEN
I THOUGHT SOME PLACE A LITTLE MORE ROMANTIC,
LIKE MY PLACE.
OH, GREAT !
WE'RE GOING
TO THE BEACH HOUSE.
NO.  I DON'T LIVE
AT THE BEACH.  DAVID--
NO, I MOVED TO THE HILLS.
I MOVED.
GOD, I HAVEN'T FELT LIKE THIS...
SINCE I WAS
WITH STELLA ADLER IN NEW YORK.
YOU JUST--  YOU'RE--
YOU'RE SO REAL.
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER
MENTIONED THIS STELLA TO ME BEFORE.
OH, HAVEN'T I ?
MM-MM.
SEE, I WOULD REMEMBER
THE NAME STELLA.
THE ONLY STELLA I EVER KNEW
WAS A PARROT.
SO WAS THAT BEFORE LESLIE ?
BEFORE US ?
I'VE NEVER MET
ANYONE LIKE YOU, BETTY.
WELL, THAT'S WHY WE'RE
MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.
YOUR DEDICATION
SCARES ME.
OH, IT'S EASY TO BE DEDICATED
WHEN YOU CARE ABOUT SOMETHING.
WHEN I MET YOU,
IT WAS LIKE A WARM BREEZE...
THAT'S SUDDENLY
BLOWN INTO MY LIFE.
YOU REMEMBER THAT LINE ?
I SAID THAT TO LESLIE DURING HER FUNERAL.
I LOVE THAT LINE.
WELL,
YOU SAID IT TO HER,
BUT YOU MEANT IT FOR ME,
DIDN'T YOU ?
YEAH.
MAYBE I DID.
SO I'M WALKIN' DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD,
CHECKING OUT
ALL THE STARS ON THE GROUND.
CLINT EASTWOOD,
ROCK HUDSON. NO PEOPLE OF RACE.
NOT ONE--
I COULD NOT FIND PEOPLE OF RACE ANYWHERE, RIGHT ?
SO I'M LOOKING
AT THIS CHINESE GUY.
HE'S READING HIS PAPER,
AND I LOOK REAL HARD, AND WHO DO I SEE ?
THAT'S LONNIE,
THE MAIN PRICK FROM THE SHOW.
AND WHO IS THAT
NEXT TO HIM ?  BETTY ! THAT'S DEFINITELY BETTY.
I TOLD YOU THIS
AIN'T NO COINCIDENCE.
WHAT THE FUCK ?
YOU BEEN HOLDING OUT ON ME ?
- THIS DOES NOT FIT
HER PROFILE. - FUCK THE PROFILE !
THAT'S THE SAME GUY !
NO, NO.  NO, NO.
BETTY WOULD NOT BE HERE
BECAUSE OF A SOAP OPERA. NOT A SOAP OPERA, MAN !
THAT WOULD MAKE HER--
THAT WOULD MAKE HER CRAZY !
NO SHIT, SHAFT !
AND YOU AIN'T TOO FAR BEHIND YOURSELF.
NO, NO.
BETTY'S SMARTER THAN THAT.
HOW THE FUCK DID YOU
STAY ON THIS JOB SO FUCKIN' LONG ?
WE ARE DRAGGIN' OUR ASS
UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY.
MEANWHILE, OUR ANSWER
TO OUR PRAYERS ARE RIGHT IN YOUR BACK FUCKIN' POCKET.
YOU LET THIS CUNT
FUCK UP MY--
DON'T YOU TALK TO BETTY
THAT WAY.
I DON'T CARE
WHAT SHE TURNS OUT TO BE.
DON'T YOU USE THAT TERM AGAIN.
YOU HEAR ME ?
YOU NEED THERAPY.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ?
YES, I UNDERSTAND !
NOW LET GO OF MY VEST. YOU'RE STRETCHING IT.
YOU MADE YOUR POINT.
GET YOURSELF READY.
GET READY ?
SHIT, I'VE BEEN READY
SINCE OKLAHOMA. "GET READY."
READY FOR WHAT ?
NO PEEKING, ALL RIGHT ?
HOW MUCH LONGER ?
NOT MUCH.
HERE WE GO.
THERE'S NOTHING IN FRONT OF YOU.
RELAX.  YOU GOT
A LITTLE STEP THERE.
YOU'RE FINE, YOU'RE FINE.
ALL RIGHT.  ALL SET ?
UH-HUH.
HERE WE GO.  AND--
SURPRISE.
LOMA VISTA.
GUESS WHAT.
YOU GOT THE JOB.
AND I'M DIRECTING.
OH, BUT I'M AT L.A. COUNTY.
OH, ARE YOU ?
COME ON.
IT'S ONLY FOUR LINES,
SO I JUST THOUGHT I'D KIND OF SPRING IT ON YOU.
HOPE THAT'S OKAY.
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ANY BLOCKING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
I'M JUST GONNA PUT YOU HERE
NEAR THE NURSE'S STATION--
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
OKAY ?  THANKS.
AND I JUST WANNA DO
LIKE A QUICK RUN-THROUGH, ALL RIGHT ?
RELAX.  YOU LOOK GREAT.
AND HERE WE GO IN A SEC. HOLD ON.
TRAFFIC WAS A NIGHTMARE
COMING OVER THE HILL.
THAT'S FINE.
WE'VE ONLY GOT... 70 PAGES TO SHOOT TODAY.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
DAVID !
WE'LL GET YOU IN YOUR HAIR
AND MAKE-UP AFTER THIS. JUST PUT THIS ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
UM--
HI.  WELCOME.
I HEAR YOU'RE REALLY GOOD.
WHAT ARE YOU

YOUR LINES ARE ON
THE CUE CARDS OVER HERE. WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE ?
OH.  BUT FEEL FREE

WATCH THE SCENE,
TAKE YOUR CUE FROM HERE.
HANK.
LINES ARE OVER HERE.
IS THIS SOME KIND OF A GAME ?
NO, IT'S MORE LIKE A NIGHTMARE I CAN'T WAKE UP FROM.
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE
IN THIS NIGHTMARE, AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET HURT.
I FEEL SO ALONE
RIGHT NOW.
HERE WE GO.
SHOW TIME.  SHOW TIME.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
I THINK YOU STEPPED ON MY FIRST LINE--
I WAS TALKING TO HER.
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING ?
LISTEN, I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE BEST WAY,
JUST KIND OF
THROW YOU INTO IT, YOU KNOW ?
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON ? IF YOU NEED LIKE A MINUTE...
JUST TO GET YOUR INSTRUMENTS
STRAIGHT, THAT'S FINE. CAN I TALK TO YOU ?
IF YOU WANNA JUST--
CAN I TALK TO YOU ? JUST A SECOND.
DAVID.
STOP CALLING ME DAVID, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
WE'RE ON THE SET.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL ME DAVID HERE, OKAY ?
WHAT'S GOING ON ?
WHAT IS GOING ON WHAT ?
YOU'RE ACTING CRAZY HERE.
ISN'T THIS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANTED ? I DON'T KNOW.
IS THERE A PROBLEM,

NO PROBLEM.  THERE'S--
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM ?
JUST DO THAT THING THAT YOU DO.
I MEAN, COME ON !

NOW, JUST RELAX AND,
AND LET'S DO IT.
HERE WE GO.  HERE WE GO.
YOU'RE FINE.  YOU'LL BE FINE. HERE WE GO.  SORRY ABOUT THAT.
ALL RIGHT ?
HERE WE GO.

NO.  IT'S MORE LIKE
A NIGHTMARE I CAN'T WAKE UP FROM.

OH, NO.  OH, NO.
OH, NO.
BETTY ?
OH, NO.

SHE CAN DO IT NOW !
I SAID FORGET IT !
ALL RIGHT.  WELL--
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT, ERIC ?
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.
I JUST PUT MY ASS ON THE LINE FOR YOU,

THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
UH, SHE'S STAYING WITH A FRIEND OF HERS,
ROSA... HERRERAS

OKAY, GREAT. ACTUALLY, THERE IS.
YOU KNOW,
I'M A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW,
AND I FIGURE YOU BEING
DR. RAVELL AND ALL,
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
ABLE TO GO OUT THERE AND TELL JASMINE TO COME OUTSIDE.
WELL, YOU THOUGHT WRONG.
HEY, MAN, IT'S JUST AN AUTOGRAPH.  IT'S NOT FOR ME.
IT NEVER IS.

HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED.
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT DEL.
HE WASN'T LYING.
YEAH, WELL,
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT WHAT THE LADY BARTENDER SAID.
YEAH, BUT YOU
WERE RIGHT FIRST.
YOU GOTTA FOLLOW
YOUR INSTINCTS.
SO WHAT DO YOUR INSTINCTS
TELL YOU NOW, KID ?
TAKE THIS SHIT
BACK TO DETROIT AND GET OUR FUCKIN' MONEY.
YEAH, WE COULD DO THAT.
I COULD BE
ON MY WAY TO FLORIDA.
YOU COULD GO ON DOWN
TO THAILAND OR SOME PLACE AND FUCK YOUR BRAINS OUT.
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO, IS IT ? NO.
SHE'S MY LAST ONE.
MY INSTINCTS ARE TELLING ME
I'VE GOT TO SEE THIS THROUGH WITH HER.
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I'VE TRIED TO TEACH YOU HERE--
- IT'S TO FOLLOW MY INSTINCTS.

OH, NO, NO.

- YOU KNOW WHO I AM ?
OH, I'VE GOT
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. LISTEN.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT DEL WAS INTO, DID YOU, BETTY ?
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
DEL WAS MIXED UP IN.
SO... YOU HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE DRUGS.
OH, MY GOD.  DRUGS ?
GOD, NO !
I AM TOTALLY
AGAINST DRUGS.
LIFE IS VERY STRANGE.
I REALLY HAD YOU PEGGED
AS A COLD-BLOODED BITCH.
I MEAN, NOT THAT I DIDN'T
STILL ADMIRE YOU FOR IT.
WHY ARE YOU HERE ?
TO SEE YOU.
I JUST PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.
I KNEW THAT DAVID,
LONNIE AND CHLOE WERE FROM THAT SHOW.
-
- BETTY THINKS THEY'RE REAL PEOPLE.
SOUNDED STRANGE,
BUT IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.
-
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ?
IGNORE HIM.
DON'T TAKE THAT TAPE OFF. YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT.
YOU'RE SUCH A LIAR,
ELDEN BALLARD !
- OH, SHUT UP !
- LIAR !  I'M THE ONE THAT FIGURED IT OUT, NOT HIM !
- SHUT UP !
- YOU ARE REALLY SMART ! - FUCK YOU, ROY OSTREY.
- HEY, SHUT UP !

SHUT THE FUCK UP
BOTH OF YOU BEFORE I KILL BOTH OF YOU !
- YOU WATCH THE SHOW ?
- YEAH, I'M THE ONE THAT WATCHED THE SHOW !
HE'S THE ONE THAT DIDN'T
'CAUSE HE'S A LIAR !
CALM DOWN !
STOP ACTING LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.
NOW, DID CHLOE CRACK ?
CHLOE FELL
COMPLETELY APART !
YOU DIDN'T KNOW CHLOE CRACKED,
DID YOU ?
WHAT ABOUT JASMINE ?
- JASMINE'S A LESBIAN.
- LYIN' MOTHERFUCKER !
YOU LIE !
JASMINE IS NOT A LESBIAN !
I KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT !
WHAT YOU WANT ?
YOU SCREAM, YOU DIE.
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS SHIT OFF.
YOU SCREAM,
YOU FUCKIN' DIE !
I HAVE A TAPE
OF TODAY'S SHOW.
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF MEN IN MOTION OVER WHAT YOU DID.
DO YOU THINK
THAT MAYBE-- NO, NO.  THEY'RE FINE.
THEY'RE FINE.
I DON'T MEET PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
I'M A GARBAGEMAN
OF THE HUMAN CONDITION. I DEAL WITH TRASH.
PEOPLE WHO WOULD TRADE ANY PART
OF THEMSELVES FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES OF THEIR ROTTEN LIVES.
BUT YOU'RE DIFFERENT.
I AM ?
YEAH.
YOU COULD PROBABLY
HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT.
AW.
SOMEBODY AS BEAUTIFUL AND AS STYLISH AS YOU ARE,
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
REALIZE IT.
I JUST DON'T THINK
I'M WHO YOU THINK I AM.
LOOK, LET ME JUST
GET THIS OUT.
I LIKE WALKS IN THE RAIN
AND SUNSETS AND SYMPHONIES,
KIDS, ANIMALS.
I READ PASSIONATELY.
I LIKE TO DISCUSS THINGS.
OH.
I GUESS, BASICALLY, I'M CONSERVATIVE,
BUT FLEXIBLE.
I FOLLOWED YOU
ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY, YOU KNOW,
AND I'VE COME
TO FEEL THAT...
WE'RE A LOT MORE ALIKE
THAN YOU THINK.
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU SAID...
THAT YOU WERE
THE GARBAGEMAN OF HUMANITY.
I JUST...
HOPED I COULD LEAVE THAT
BEHIND ME.
I THOUGHT "NO" MEANT NO.
FIRST OF ALL,
DON'T INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE...
BY TELLING ME
THAT DAVID RAVELL ATTACKED YOU IN THAT CAR.
SO, UM, THAT JASMINE,
SHE'S CERTAINLY IS INTRIGUING, ISN'T SHE ?
JASMINE AIN'T NO DYKE.
SHE'S JUST TRYIN' TO FIND HERSELF.
- YOU'RE MY ONLY FRIEND.
- LOOK AT THE TITTIES ON JASMINE.
JASMINE IS A WILDCAT.
YOU WOULD NEVER COOK UP A SCHEME LIKE THIS, WOULD YOU ?
WHAT THE--  OH, SHIT !
-
- WESLEY ! GET OVER THERE.
DADDY !
WHAT ?  WESLEY ?
OH, MY GOD !
MY FISH ARE OUT THERE !
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
THEY'RE NISHIKI GOI. HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT ?
HEY, WE'RE IN A SHOOT-OUT HERE !
YOU WANNA SHUT UP ABOUT THE DAMN FISH ?
NO, ELDEN !
YOU SHUT UP !
I'LL GET YOUR FISH.
ROY.
OH, CHRIST.
WHAT ?
TH--  THEY--
THEY SHOT MY BOY.
MY SON IS DEAD.
SORRY.
YOU'RE THE REASON
I'M HERE.
OH.
OHH !
SHIT.
GO CHECK HIS JACKET.
GIVE ME THE GUN. I'LL COVER YOU.
- NO.  LET'S WAIT
FOR THE REAL POLICE. - I AM THE REAL POLICE !
- WHY CAN'T WE SNEAK OUTSIDE ?
- LADY, YOU JUST DON'T RUN AWAY FROM CRIME.
AND BETTY'S IN THERE.
SO ALL OF THIS REALLY IS
BECAUSE OF A SOAP OPERA.
MY SON IS DEAD BECAUSE...
YOU WANTED TO BE
WITH THIS DOCTOR.
THIS FAKE DOCTOR.
WELL, TOO LATE ANYWAY.
YOU COULD AT LEAST
GIVE ME MY GUN.
MAYBE I COULD SHOOT MY WAY OUT,
TAKE A COUPLE OF THEM WITH ME.
I THINK I'D RATHER NOT.
BETTY, PLEASE.  PLEASE.
I DON'T WANNA SHRIVEL UP ALONE
IN SOME STINKIN' PRISON. NO WAY.
I'VE GOT
MY PROFESSIONAL PRIDE.
AND...
I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY ELSE
TO GET CREDIT FOR TAKING ME OUT.
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME.
BETTY--
YOU NEVER NEEDED
THAT ACTOR.
YOU DON'T NEED
THAT DOCTOR.
YOU DON'T NEED ANY MAN.
IT'S NOT THE '40s,
YOU KNOW.
HONEY,
YOU DON'T NEED ANYBODY.
YOU KNOW WHY ?
HMM ?
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT
YOURSELF.
IN A STORY THAT POLICE SAY IS BIZARRE EVEN FOR HOLLYWOOD,
A FATHER-SON TEAM
OF KILLERS...
TRACKED A KANSAS SOAP OPERA FAN
HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
ONLY TO FIND THEMSELVES
THE VICTIMS IN A FINAL, BLOODY CONFRONTATION.
WE GO NOW TO BEBE BURKE
AT THE SCENE OF THE-- THAT'S OUR BETTY.
THIS STORY
IS BEYOND BELIEF, WHICH IS PERFECT FOR US.
IT'S FREE ADVERTISING.
IT'S GONNA RUN FOR MONTHS.
I DON'T THINK
SHE CAN DO IT.
I REALLY DON'T.
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?
DID YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED ?
WELL, WHO WOULDN'T FREEZE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ?
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT HER PROBLEMS ARE.
SHE WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST PERSON IN THE CAST WITH PROBLEMS.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
NOTHING TO LOSE BY SENDING YOU TO TALK TO HER.
ME ?  OKAY.
LET'S TALK ABOUT ME.
WHAT ABOUT MY FEELINGS
ABOUT ALL OF THIS ?
I DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.
I DID LIKE
YOUR ICY WATER IDEA THE OTHER DAY THOUGH.
YEAH ?
I'M TOYING WITH THE IDEA
OF KILLING DAVID RAVELL OFF...
IN A BOATING ACCIDENT.
ONE OF THOSE
CASTAWAY DEALS WITH CHLOE AND--
NO, NO, NO.  DON'T--
DON'T TRY THE BLACKMAIL BULLSHIT WITH ME, LYLA,
'CAUSE IT'S KINDA,
IT'S BENEATH YOU, SO DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID.
I'M SORRY FOR THE THINGS
THAT I SAID AND...
FOR NOT
RESPECTING YOU...
AND JUST ALL THE STUPID
LITTLE THINGS THAT I WAS--
WHEN YOU HAVE A MINUTE.
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF AUTOGRAPHS,
AND I'M KIND OF
IN A MOMENT RIGHT HERE, SO--
IT'S THE CHECK.
I--  SORRY ABOUT THAT.
UH--  NO.  I GOT THIS.
I GOT THIS.
MY TREAT.
IT'S NOT THE '40s,
YOU KNOW.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW THAT MY BEST FRIEND
ONCE SAID...
THAT IF YOU WERE
ANY HANDSOMER, IT'D BE A CRIME ?
THANK YOU.
IT'S JUST TOO BAD THAT YOU'RE SUCH AN ASSHOLE.
UH, THAT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT ? THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M OKAY WITH THAT. THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.
NOW WE'VE SETTLED
THE WHOLE ASSHOLE THING, WELL--
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT
YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT JOINING THE SHOW ?
AT ALL ?
THERE'S ALWAYS
A CHANCE, DAVID.
BUT WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW
AND THE NEXT DAY...
IF YOU WERE
ANY HANDSOMER, DOCTOR, IT'D BE A CRIME.
I TAKE IT THAT MEANS
YOU'RE FREE TOMORROW.
I WAS GOING
TO ASK YOU THAT TOO.
LIKE--  LIKE YOU
DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE OR WHAT YOU WERE DOING ?
-
I HAVE THAT EFFECT
ON PEOPLE.
EXCUSE ME, SIR ?
SIR ?
