Previously on
I may have a lead on Nikita.
Oversight is thinking about
executing "Clean Sweep".
What the hell is that?
Years ago,
when Percy created Division,
Oversight insisted
he build in a fail-safe.
There's a tanker of VX gas
tapped into Division's
ventilation system.
pulls the trigger,
the place will be
a mass grave.
Why is Oversight doing this?
Thanks to you,
Division has become expendable.
You're planning an escape,
which we both know
is impossible.
There is no way out of here.
No way that you can see.
But you will.
We have to get
out of here, now.
On your knees!
I take my orders from
the same man I always have.
That's one
of the Guardians.
That's why
they were gathering,
their target was Oversight.
Percy.
Release Percy, or you eliminate
the members of Oversight.
That's correct.
Sounds good to me.
Keep listening.
Failure to comply will result
in the activation
of Clean Sweep.
Which means
now it won't take me more
than 30 seconds
to launch the program.
If you attempt evacuation,
we trigger it immediately.
How would they know
if she evac'd?
Roan. Percy's got him
on the inside.
Guys, shh.
And everyone inside
your facility dies.
Percy will give you
instructions for the next step.
There's a flaw
in your plan.
Really?
If Clean Sweep releases
VX gas through the facility,
everyone dies,
including you.
I can live with that.
The captain goes down
with the ship.
Percy's bluffing.
He's not.
My mother told me
Clean Sweep
could be activated
from anywhere.
Yeah,
but it can be deactivated
from the ventilation control.
Percy would have
thought of that.
Get me an E.O.D. unit down here,
right away.
I need to get
through this door.
There has to be
a way to stop this.
There is.
Kill the Guardian,
grab the trigger.
Whoa, what are
we talking about here,
saving Division?
It's saving lives.
Yeah, lives that
are trying to kill us.
You want to save them so they
can keep trying to kill us?
It's not about saving
Division, Birkhoff.
It's about ending this.
Our way, not Percy's.
We're gonna need directions
to Oversight.
I'll tell you
on the way there.
You tried to kill us,
what makes you think
you're along for the ride?
I was just trying
to protect my family.
Still am.
Sean, we're going
out there to save her.
Well then you'll need a lot
more than just her location.
You'll need
a tactical breakdown
of the perimeter
and the interior.
You need me there.
You're holding four prominent
Americans at gunpoint,
right now, no one knows.
The second
you touch the trigger,
you create national news,
and a nationwide manhunt.
Think about it.
Oh, I appreciate
your concern,
but Percy's got a plan.
Was it Percy's plan
to end up in a cell?
No.
He was betrayed.
Like hell.
Percy's the traitor.
He sold out his country,
and one day,
he's going to sell you out,
only you're too stupid
to see it.
Ah, oh.
Anyone else got a salient
point they'd like to share?
It'll take Phelps' team two
hours to dismantle that bomb.
You haven't got that long.
I won't give you Division.
You say that as though
you had a choice.
I'll let you go.
In exchange
for the Clean Sweep trigger.
Go where?
That would be your choice.
But if you try
to return to Division,
I'll have you shot on sight.
Hm.
You taught me
a good negotiation
is one in which both parties
leave slightly disappointed.
You get to live,
which is disappointing to me,
I remain in control of Division,
which is disappointing to you.
Queen of the understatement.
State it any way you like.
These are my terms.
Just the navigator.
No weapon, and you listen
to everything we say.
You got a t-shirt
I can borrow?
No.
Birkhoff, please,
think of a way to remotely
deactivate the trigger.
I told you, I would have seen
this system if it existed,
okay, it's not enough just
to pump gas in there,
you have to close off
the outside vents,
shut down the elevators,
all that takes power.
And I personally retailored
the electrical grid when I...
Was there.
What?
The old generator.
The emergency backup?
No, no, no, the generator that
used to power the missile base.
Can you hack it?
The only way
to shut that thing down
is to cut the hard-line,
up close and personal.
Well, we can't get in there.
I can.
Alex, that place is a gas
chamber waiting to happen.
If I hadn't
sent that bank transfer,
the Guardians wouldn't
be where they are right now.
I need to do this.
And I'm the only one who can.
Okay.
Alex heads to Division.
We head to Oversight.
Can I speak with you
for a second?
So that's two Guardians,
Amanda, and one rogue Navy Seal.
That's a lot of variables
for one mission.
At least we know what
the variables are,
right?
Contact the safe house
in Brighton Beach,
put them on standby.
Thank you
for coming down, sir.
What is it?
I'm busy.
We've had some success
tracking the Guardian
we lost in Basel.
Spyder picked up
on his image in Amsterdam,
where he met with another man,
whom we also believe to be
one of Percy's Guardians.
Do you believe they have
the Black Boxes with them?
I assume so.
The two men traveled
to Brussels via rail,
where they chartered a private jet
to Newark International.
I've yet to pinpoint
their current location,
but I would like to retask
the team assigned to hunting
for Alexandra
and put them on the trail.
So, now, Black Boxes are more
important than Alexandra?
They both hold secrets
about you, sir,
secrets we want to destroy.
Just make sure that your team
hits their mark this time.
Your master and I have reached
a new agreement.
There'll be no new agreement.
Talk to him yourself.
Hold your position.
I'm coming to you.
{pub}Those were
the perimeter guards.
Well, it's definitely
the right place.
Used to be a safe house
during the Revolutionary War.
and at least one point
of egress on every side.
Is our line still open?
Keep moving.
Sounds like they're
moving the hostages.
Everyone take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.
Or not.
Why are you moving us
into the study?
Sit down.
I'm going in.
No, wait, whoa, whoa.
There are two chemically
enhanced killers in there
who can hear a pin drop.
If we go in hot,
they will hear,
and that means everyone in that
house and Division will die.
Sean, we have to be careful.
Clear the perimeter,
set up two
long-distance shots.
They're the only ones
we're going to get.
It will be faster
if we split up.
No.
We do the sweep together.
You know, this would be a
lot easier if you
just trusted me.
It's not about trust,
it's about making sure
you've got this down.
Okay, this ain't like
plugging in a toaster.
Now one more time, once you
get down into the silo,
what are you gonna do?
I hit up
the generator access panel,
I plug your phone in, and
your program drains the power.
Right. Now keep in mind,
this thing has
a three-phase transformer
with a four-wire output, okay?
The gray wires...
Are you listening to me?
Yeah, it's all
on your magic phone, right?
Just trying to give
you some context.
Here.
This should get you around
the internal scramblers.
You know, if I'd
had this last year,
I wouldn't have had
to use that shell program.
Have fun
storming the castle.
By the way, what the hell
are you going to tell Amanda?
Exactly what
she wants to hear.
I will confirm our arrival
once we reach the rendez-vous.
Actually, Lawrence will.
I want you on base,
monitoring the perimeter,
in case there are any more
surprises waiting for us.
I'll be tracking
the escort team,
but I want verbal
updates every 15 minutes
confirming your status.
He may try to talk to you,
or convince you, manipulate you.
As long as you know that
everything out of his mouth
is a lie.
I will miss you.
Percy's on the move.
I had to meet him halfway.
I'm more concerned about
the problem inside Division.
We have a saboteur.
Something's moving.
We gotta stop him.
They're going to hear.
Why didn't you shoot him?
I wanted to,
make it look like
the guard did it, but...
It's a different
caliber gun.
The Guardian inside would have
heard and shot everyone else.
No way.
You think I wanted
to let him die?
You don't know me.
Lawrence, at this pace we have
you arriving at the Gates house
in approximately 30 minutes.
Does that match your estimate?
Affirmative.
I want a progress report
from Phelps.
We're looking at
four detonator cords,
all rigged to
an electrical housing unit.
I'm guessing we'll need
to open this thing up first
before we can
disable the fuses.
No guesses, just results.
I'm picking up a bogey on our
thermal image scanners,
approaching the northern
external perimeter.
I have Alexandra Udinov
at the northeast gate.
She's requesting entry.
Bring her in.
Eric Lawrence.
You were looking at
for smashing a man's head
against a telephone pole
until his neck snapped.
Granted, he did
rape your sister.
But there was no
material evidence
that would have led
to an appeal.
And then I stepped in.
Got you out,
gave you back your life.
Taught you how
to fight for freedom.
Now look at you.
Benjamin Greenwood.
Got you out of an institution
for the criminally insane.
Adrian Paticki.
Wrongfully sentenced,
but on death row.
I saved all your lives,
which is why it pains me
that you would demonstrate
more loyalty to Amanda
than you would to me.
I was beginning to wonder if
I'd ever hear from you again.
I know.
I have a lot to explain.
I know you went
into Russia, Alex.
I warned you
about attacking Semak
without my help,
before you were ready.
I know.
You're lucky you survived.
I know.
How did you make it out?
It couldn't have been easy.
I got in on my own,
and I got out the same way.
Hm.
But you were
right about Semak.
It was too much for me
to handle on my own.
Especially because of what
I found there.
Please, tell me
you didn't know.
Know what?
My mother, Katya.
She's alive.
I don't understand.
Semak must have made
a deal with Percy.
He's the only reason I'm back.
I don't care if I have to
torture it out of him,
I want to know why
he lied to me.
I'm afraid that's going
to be difficult right now.
I just wish I had more time
to convince you
that what you're doing
is wrong.
It just doesn't seem fair.
Oh, well.
There's something wrong.
{pub}How close are we?
We've interrupted
the electrical current
of the detonator hub,
but we still need
to make sure there aren't any
tilt vibration switches
before we move anything.
Time is not a luxury you have,
take too long
and you might
not live to see tomorrow.
How the hell did Percy get
a weapon?
Percy has a silent partner
inside Division.
Right now,
Roan is my prime suspect.
That would be a good guess.
I've been following
his movements.
But I'm concerned
he may be collaborating
with others.
In fact, the only person I know
he's not working with is you.
You've been away.
Do me a favor.
Keep an eye on him,
report back to me.
Once I know who
he's working with,
I intend to drown him in
a pool of his own acid.
Hey, it's me,
we have a problem.
With the generator?
With Percy.
He was on his way to you, and he took out
the Alpha team that was escorting him.
Where is he now?
He disabled
the vehicle tracker.
What are you gonna do?
You just focus
on your objective.
Now that Amanda's lost
her leverage over Percy,
nothing's going to stop him
from hitting that trigger.
Alex, you are our best shot
at stopping Clean Sweep.
Enjoying the countryside?
Eh, the ragweed,
doesn't agree with me.
Take an allergy pill.
Roan's gun came in handy.
What about the hostages?
Tell them to sit tight.
I can't wait to see them.
I've spent my life
in the military.
I understand what it is to be
beholden to your C.O.
that sense of duty,
obeying the orders,
following them into
the jaws of death.
But you don't have
to get caught up in this war,
you have options.
If you had a little money
in your pocket,
more than a little,
you wouldn't have
to answer to Percy
anymore.
According to
local news reports,
a small
recreational plane
crashed just outside
of Saratoga National Park.
The pilot, one Darren Smalls,
had just signed
up two passengers
for skydiving,
but only his body
was recovered from the wreckage.
The names of the passengers
match the names on the fake
passports used by the Guardians.
You believe they jumped
out of this plane?
Where could they be headed?
The only structure of note
within a 20 kilometer radius
of the crash,
is an old historical landmark,
the Gates house.
Satellite imagery
of the location
reveals several
vehicles outside.
I think they're
there right now.
Is the team on their way?
En route as we speak.
You sure we shouldn't
be wearing bomb suits?
This thing goes off
in this corridor,
concussion alone would
turn us into jelly.
Plus, the suit makes
my hands sweat.
One down, three to go.
I'm going to head up,
grab some magnetized
soldering wire.
Hi, Percy.
{pub}You, here.
What are the odds?
Tell your Guardians to
give up the Clean Sweep trigger,
and Oversight,
and you may get
out of here alive.
Michael,
I see you're embracing the whole
"rebel without a cause" motif,
right down to the hairstyle.
Can I shoot him now?
Not yet.
I crashed your little
"Guardian party" in Amsterdam.
The Boxes are gone,
along with your
insurance policy.
How do you think
we got here?
We followed your boys.
Even if that were the case,
the Guardians have been given
strict instructions
to pull the trigger
and gas Division
if anything happens to me.
I'm in,
I'm headed to the silo.
Five by five.
Did Amanda give you
any trouble?
No, she's all freaked
out about Percy and Roan.
She asked me
to go spy on him.
But you're
blowing her off, right?
Yup.
What are you doing down here?
Oh, no, that's not good.
I was actually looking
for you.
I know you were there
the night Division raided
my family's home.
You said "mother down",
confirming your kill.
But she wasn't dead,
was she?
You used a tranquilizer,
a little special side mission
for Percy.
I want to know the truth about
what happened on that night.
That's not why you're here.
Well then,
why the hell are you here?
Oh, just sabotaging Division.
Special little side mission
for Percy.
Phelps, is that you?
I feel like I've landed
in an alternate universe.
You, fighting
to save Division.
I don't expect you
to understand me, Percy.
I understood your quest
for vengeance,
retribution for your fiance.
Do you two talk much
about Daniel?
Must be a little awkward, since
you knew about the kill order
and didn't warn her.
If you think anyone's going
to believe your lies,
you're wrong.
Owen told me
the truth about Daniel.
But does Michael
know the truth
about you and Owen?
See, that's the look
that tells me
everything I need to know.
The crack in the foundation.
I don't blame you.
She lured you in with
the promise of regaining
everything that you'd lost.
Next thing you know,
you're knee-deep
in Nikita's war
with no end in sight.
That's funny.
I see an end in sight,
right here.
Such a commanding presence.
It's like she's leading
the new crusades.
So many people willing to lay
down their lives for you.
Like that poor fool
over there.
Sean Pierce.
That's a hell of a get.
I can still see your pimply face
on the family Christmas cards.
Looks like the Navy made
a real man out of you.
You're here
for Senator Madeline.
Mommy.
Uh-uh.
If I don't answer it,
Patrick will wonder what's
happened to me.
And if he thinks
anything's gone wrong...
I have Percy.
Give me the trigger
and release the hostages,
or he dies.
How do I know
he's not dead already?
Tell them our demands.
Kill them all but Madeline.
Son of a bitch!
I think we both know,
they had it coming.
And now that Oversight's
out of the way,
I'm willing to negotiate.
I'll give you Senator Pierce,
if you let me go
with the trigger.
Sean.
Cover him.
We can't go along with this.
We have to.
Giving him the trigger?
If Alex kills
the power on site,
we're in the clear.
He doesn't know about her,
Michael.
Birkhoff, are you there?
Holy crap, you're alive.
I thought the Terminator
got you.
He's still after me.
Okay, Birkhoff,
I'm at the control panel.
Okay, great.
Get my phone out.
I lost the phone.
Without the program...
It's okay,
we can do it manually.
It's simple,
it's like unplugging a toaster.
I thought you said...
I know,
I was just being me.
I'll walk you through it.
You've become a world-class
operative, Nikita.
I just hope someday
you stop trying to run
from who you really are.
I'm in your blood,
for better or worse.
Shut up, before
I change my mind
about blowing your head off.
Clear!
{pub}We have unidentified agents
approaching from the east.
Farewell.
We're experiencing
a power outage.
Elevators and main
hydraulic lifts are stalled.
Scanning for remote exploits.
The first wire
you're looking for is red.
Yeah, I see it.
Russian.
Gogol must have been
tracking Patrick.
They're trying
to take Sean's position.
- Cover me.
- Negative!
Get inside the house.
Gogol agents might
be inside already.
You have to get her out.
I'll stay and cover him.
Let's go!
Okay, I've got the blue one.
Okay, great,
you've got one more left.
It's the black one connected
to the transformer.
That'll cancel the override.
Got it.
Good, now get the hell
out of there.
Where's Sean?
He's outside.
And you're welcome.
Behind you.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thank you.
{pub}This is Admiral Winnick
of Southern Command.
Yes, he was.
This is Amanda.
Confirm Division survived.
Senator, are you all right?
Yes.
Percy and his men left.
And Clean Sweep,
has it been...
Averted.
Percy must have lost
control of the trigger,
or perhaps it was destroyed.
Whatever the case,
I've made sure Clean Sweep will
never threaten Division again.
Shall I send escorts
for you and the others?
It's just me.
That's... unfortunate.
We'll get to work on
a cover story right away,
to explain their deaths.
Most likely the act
of a deranged
domestic terrorist.
Yes. Make sure it looks
as though they died heroes.
And once things settle down,
we need to discuss how
to proceed with Division.
Needless to say,
after recent events,
a low profile is in order.
Absolutely.
We'll discuss it next week
in Washington.
It's probably best to keep
communications to a minimum.
As you say, we should
all keep our heads down.
Amanda.
After all,
we wouldn't want to risk
setting off any flags with
your colleagues in D.C.
But I promise,
Division will stay
strong and alert.
Good-bye.
What's wrong?
It's Amanda.
I've lost control of her.
Division's still standing.
Clean Sweep failed.
That's good.
Leaves us some options.
Let's get moving.
How did you...
Roan.
Ah. I take it you lost him.
I survived him.
You were right.
He was Percy's inside man.
And now he's gone.
As is Percy.
What about you, Alex?
Where will you go now?
I don't know.
Semak is still out there.
So is my mother.
And she's with him.
Alex, believe it or not,
I still want to help you.
Why?
So you can get
a foothold in Zetrov?
Not interested.
You should be.
You threaten the hold
Semak has on his empire.
That's why he fears you.
Alexandra Udinov's existence
has the potential
to shatter his world.
Too bad the world thinks
Alexandra Udinov is dead.
But what if they were
to learn the truth?
If Division's
truly gone rogue,
you have no choice.
You have to contact the CIA.
Yeah, what are
they going to do?
Send in the Marines?
Division's an army.
You're going to have
a war on your hands.
She's right.
Enough people have died.
It's funny.
You seem to be so concerned
about the body count now.
Didn't bother you when you were
sanctioning all those hits.
They were necessary.
Oh, I'm sure
it seemed necessary
in this room.
But I was the one
who had to pull the trigger.
You were a soldier.
I was a killer.
You're right.
I don't know what it's like.
You had to live in Division,
I didn't.
Which is why you're the only one
who can take it down
without exposing it
to the public.
I hate to say it,
but she has a point.
Exposing Division
is just as bad
as releasing the Black Boxes.
This is the person
who put a target on our backs.
What if I could fix that?
Clear your names.
A presidential pardon.
No.
If you reveal your part
in this to the President,
you'll go to prison.
No.
I would receive immunity
for my silence.
What do you say?
I thought today was going
to be the day it all ended.
It might not have worked
out that way,
but this is the first time
I can see a real light
at the end of the tunnel,
for all of us.
We're almost there.
Of course,
Percy's still a problem,
when is he not?
He's down to Roan
and one Guardian,
thanks to your hit squad.
Then I guess their timing
was perfect.
How can I repay you?
Oh,
I can think of a few ways.
Time for that later,
we still have business
to discuss.
My superiors are no longer
an issue.
Yes, we still have my boss
to contend with.
Well the good news
on that front is that
I think Alexandra may
be ready to make her return.
And Nikita?
I have a future planned
for her too.
It's considerably shorter.
