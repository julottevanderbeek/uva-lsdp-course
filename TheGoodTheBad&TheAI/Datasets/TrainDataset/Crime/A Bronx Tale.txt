- You got the note?
- Yeah, right.
Nice and tight.
Two, three, four.
This is the Fordham section
of The Bronx: my home.
A world unto itself.
Any borough
is only 15 minutes away...
but they seem 3,000 miles away.
That's Mount Carmel Church.
The sound of the bells
filled the neighborhood.
lt was 1960, and doo-wop
was the sound on the streets.
l felt like there was a doo-wop
group on every corner back then.
What a time it was.
The Yankees were playing the
Pirates in the World Series...
and Mickey Mantle
was like a god to me.
My dad and l would go to Yankee
Stadium and see the Yankees win.
That's the Chez Bippy,
where all the guys hung out.
l'll tell you about them later.
That's my building.
l live on the third floor.
There's my stoop.
On warm summer nights
all through the neighborhood...
you would hear young ltalian men
romancing their women.
Hey, Marie!
- Get in the fucking car!
- No!
- Get in the car!
- Leave me alone.
- You know l love you.
- Yeah, bullshit.
Get in the fucking car!
And right there,
under that lamppost there...
stood the number-one man
in the neighborhood, Sonny.
Everybody loved Sonny
and treated him like a god.
And in my neighborhood,
he was a god.
l would sit on my stoop and
watch him, all day and night.
But he would never even
look at me.
Never, until one day.
- What do you want?
- You got room there for us?
You wish.
- Oh, shit!
- Let's go!
That's my dad, Lorenzo Anello.
His bus route was 187th Street.
l used to love riding with him.
That's me, Calogero,
at nine years old.
See you later, Pop.
Go right upstairs, son.
That's my mom, Rosina.
She met my dad at a dance.
They fell in love
and been together since.
You're always listening.
Take care of this fucking--
Come on. Knock him out!
The Chez Bippy.
This is where all the guys hung out.
Get the fuck out of here!
Take a walk!
Tony Toupee was owner of the bar
in name only.
lt was really Sonny's place.
Tony was a frustrated singer.
Everybody hated his voice.
So just for spite, he would
never utter a spoken word.
He would only sing it.
He was Tony Toupee
because of his lousy hairpiece.
Eddie Mush
was a degenerate gambler.
He was the world's
biggest loser.
He was "Mush" because everything
he touched turned to mush.
Never mind.
l need a winner.
At the track, the teller would
give him his tickets ripped up.
l had the Yankees. They lost.
lf it wasn't for bad luck,
l wouldn't have no luck at all.
JoJo the Whale.
You didn't walk with JoJo,
you walked among him.
lf you stared long enough,
you'd see him get fatter by the hour.
Legend has it his shadow
once killed a dog.
They called him
Frankie Coffeecake...
because his face looked like
a Drake's Coffeecake.
He was tough to look at.
Hey, kid, how you doing?
His name was Jimmy Whispers.
He was Sonny's main man.
He was "Whispers" because
everything was a secret to him.
Danny K.O. knocked guys out...
and Bobby Bars spent
half his life behind them.
This was Sonny's crew, and
nobody fucked with these guys.
What are you doing here
Didn't we tell you not to come here?
l told you to come upstairs!
Wait till l tell your father!
- What were you doing here?
- l was looking for Daddy.
That's very nice!
l have to get something in the store.
Don't move!
You wait right here! You hear me?
l always tried to imitate Sonny.
He still wouldn't look at me.
Sonny had five fingers...
but he only used three.
Come on. Let's go.
Move. Upstairs.
l'm not in the mood for steak.
You're not?
You know how often l have to drive
that bus back and forth...
so we can eat steak once a week?
- Seven.
- Who told you that?
Nobody. l counted.
Your father
wants to talk to you.
- About what?
- You were by the bar today.
- l wasn't.
- Tell your father the truth!
- l was by the bar.
- Why'd you lie?
- l took a shot.
- Wanna do something here?
What am l gonna say?
Nice try, son.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Lorenzo, come on, please!
How can l keep him away?
lt's two doors away.
Daddy's right.
Listen to him.
Shut up.
Nobody's talking to you.
Give me your plate.
l want you to listen to me.
Do not go near the bar.
Stay on the stoop.
- When you're older, you'll understand.
- Yes.
- You don't see me going there.
- Mommy won't let you go either?
- What am l going to do?
- l got him all day.
l'm just kidding.
l'll won't go near the bar.
Look what l got. Two tickets,
Yankee Stadium, center field.
- Behind the Mick?
- Right behind number seven.
- Now eat your steak.
- Yeah!
Let's go, Alfie.
That's Phil the Peddler.
He would call everybody "Mary."
Me and my friends would
love to break his balls.
Slick and Crazy Mario
were my best friends.
Slick got his name
because of his hair.
Mario got his
because he was just crazy.
l'll kick your fucking asses
for you, you bunch of Marys.
Stay away from the fruit!
Keep your hands off the fruit!
You fucking Marys!
l'll kick you loose, you Marys!
The three of you!
l'll kick your fucking asses,
you fucking ball breakers!
Stay away from the vegetables!
What do you think this is?
Wait! Go make your mother
and father feed you!
l'll give you the heave-ho,
you fucking ball breakers!
How many did you get?
You don't stop
borrowing money!
Oh, boy,
Coffeecake's in trouble again.
What should l do?
He's gonna get his ass kicked.
Guys, check it out.
Mario, who's this?
That's Jimmy Whispers.
You'd better talk to him again.
You're responsible for him.
Whoa! Come on, wait a minute.
lt's Sonny.
You do somebody now,
big mouth.
Do somebody hard,
like Coffeecake.
- l can't do Coffeecake!
- That's hard.
Put a screen in front of your
face while l throw shit at it.
Oh, shit.
These niggers got some balls,
coming in our neighborhood.
They just pass through
from school.
- How the fuck do you know?
- Dad told me.
My father told me
that's how it starts.
Hey, get the fuck out of our
neighborhood, fucking niggers!
Go back where you came from!
You're lucky
you're on that bus!
Go back where you came from!
Stay out of our neighborhood!
l'll kick your fucking ass!
Why?
You don't fucking stop.
Get the fuck out of here!
Nobody's cooler than you, Sonny.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, you scumbag!
You motherfucker!
l'll bust your fucking head!
l'll bust your fucking head!
What's going on here?
Give me the gun!
Move the fucking car!
Come on!
When Sonny looked at me,
l went deaf.
l couldn't hear.
All l could see was Sonny
with the gun in his hand.
What happened?
Dad, it was just
a parking space.
- You don't understand.
- ls he all right?
- Baby, are you okay?
- Let's go inside.
- What happened?
- l'm okay, Mom.
Oh, my god, l got so scared.
You don't understand. They were
fighting over a parking space. Why?
lt wasn't over a parking space.
They just met at the wrong time.
- What kind of answer is that?
- Leave it alone.
He's okay.
That's the main thing.
l can't believe somebody
would do this.
Who is it?
Police. ls this
the Anello residence?
Yeah. Can l help you?
We'd like to ask you
some questions.
- About what?
- Just open the door!
How you doing? Good.
l'm Detective Belsik.
This is Detective Vella.
Hello, son. How you doing, ma'am?
We'd like to ask your son
a few questions.
- About what?
- There was a shooting outside.
- We believe your son was there.
- Really? He knows nothing about that.
There were people who saw him.
They're wrong.
He don't know nothing.
We can do things
the nice way or the hard way.
l don't care.
He don't know nothing.
Daddy, l know everything.
Kids. Sometimes they
make believe they see things.
We didn't pick your name out of a hat.
We know he was there. So let's go.
Son, here's what
l'd like you to do for us.
Take a walk downstairs with us and
your father. We have people down there.
l want you to pick out
the person you saw with the gun.
That's it. You think
you could do that for us?
Good. Come on.
Let's take a walk.
Mr. Anello,
take a walk downstairs.
- We won't be long.
- Will he be okay?
Everything's fine.
They'll be back in two minutes.
There's Lorenzo.
Fellas, turn around.
You two, take your hats off.
Put your head up.
Straight ahead. Look this way.
- ls that him?
- No.
How about this guy?
Straight ahead, fella.
How about him?
Straight ahead, you.
How about this guy?
Give me an answer.
How about him?
How about him?
ls it this guy?
Give me an answer.
Hey! Put your eyes up!
How about this guy?
Let's go. Hey, look
straight ahead! Over here.
Look at me. That's it.
ls it this guy?
- How about this guy?
- No.
Look at this guy.
How about him?
Hey! Straight ahead.
How about this guy?
ls it him?
Give me an answer.
- You satisfied, Officer?
- No.
- He don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, he doesn't know.
- He said he can't help you.
- Take a walk.
- Go ahead. Take a walk.
- Come on, son.
You guys can breathe again.
Get out of my sight.
- We really fooled them, Dad.
- Yeah.
l didn't rat, Dad.
No, you didn't rat.
l did a good thing, right?
Yeah, you did a good thing
for a bad man.
l did a good thing
for a bad man.
l didn't understand that
at nine years old.
All l knew was...
a rat was the lowest thing you
could be in my neighborhood...
and l didn't rat.
Why did you say l did
a good thing for a bad man?
Because sometimes you have to do
things that aren't right.
Do you understand?
No. lt's just that l thought
l did the right thing.
Now l'm not sure l did.
You did do the right thing.
When you get older, you'll see.
Your mother and l
love you very much.
Tomorrow you ride
on the bus with me. Okay?
City lsland was the last stop
on my father's route.
lt was one of our
favorite places.
lt was like
a daylong vacation.
My dad listened to jazz
and we talked about baseball.
Can l have an ice cream?
We do our job first,
then ice cream.
Okay, Pop.
Here.
- Let's play the game.
- Let's see how good you are.
What player last won
the Triple Crown?
Mickey Mantle.
Batting average, .353.
RBls, 130. Home runs, 52.
- That's pretty good.
- He's the greatest player ever.
Joe D.'s
the greatest ballplayer.
The Yankee Clipper.
- Nobody beat that. Right, Dad?
- Nobody beat that, son.
- You know why Joe D. was great?
- Because he was ltalian?
- Well, that's part of it.
- Then why?
Because he had the most talent.
That's right.
- Do l have talent, Dad?
- Of course you do.
Can l be a ballplayer?
You can be anything
you want to be.
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.
lf you've got talent and do the
wrong thing, nothing happens.
But when you do right,
good things happen.
- You hear me?
- You're right.
- Let's get that ice cream.
- Good.
- l'll shut the doors, right?
- Yeah.
Ready. Watch it.
- Got it?
- l got it.
Wasted talent was something my
father talked about all my life.
Let's hurry.
The game's starting.
the final game...
of the '60 Series.
And what a ball game
they're looking at.
Moose Skowron, with that
infield hit deep to third...
has picked up his twelfth
World Series base hit in 1960.
Time called. Blanchard back--
Come on, Sonny.
One out, unassisted,
to Nelson, to end the sixth.
Southpaw hitter.
Elroy Face...
staring down to
his battery mate Hal Smith.
lnto the stretch.
The little man sets.
Here's the first one
to Blanchard.
Outside and a ball.
See you later, Pop.
Get right upstairs
and watch the rest of the game.
No hanging out, son.
Hey, Lorenzo, how you doing?
Keep driving.
l want to talk to you.
Your kid is a good kid.
Thanks.
Sonny appreciates
what you two did.
That's all right. l'm just glad
everything worked out.
He'll help you now.
You drop some numbers off for us
and make $150 a week.
- Do it right off the bus.
- Thanks, but l got a city job.
- l could lose it.
- Think about it.
l just can't do it.
$150 a week. You don't
want to think about it?
l can't do this.
lt's not for me.
Sonny will be disappointed,
but l'll give him your answer.
Stop the bus.
l want to get off.
- They offered me a job today.
- Doing what?
Numbers. l just drop off
a piece of paper...
and get 150 a week.
What did you say?
What do you think?
l told him it's not for me.
What?
l don't know. 150 dollars?
lt's only numbers.
- You think l should've took it?
- l don't know.
But you get involved with those guys,
next thing, one, two three--
l don't like the way you look.
Maybe you're right.
- l'm going to check on the baby.
- Come here.
- What?
- Come here.
Are you sorry you got stuck
with a bus driver?
l fell in love
with your uniform.
The day of the funeral,
l felt really bad.
l realized a man died, and l
lied and committed a mortal sin.
l wanted God's forgiveness.
Bless me, Father,
for l have sinned.
lt has been one month
since my last confession...
and these are my sins:
l missed Sunday Mass twice...
l lied
about witnessing a murder once.
- l ate meat on Friday--
- Wait. Can you back up a bit?
l ate meat on Friday once?
Not that one.
Back up a little more.
- About witnessing a murder?
- Yeah, that's the one.
Do you realize what you said?
lt was only once.
- Do you know what the fifth is?
- Yes, Father, l know.
"l refuse to answer
because l might incrimin--"
The Fifth Commandment.
"Thou shall not kill."
That's right. Now, l want you
to tell me what happened.
No, Father, l'm not
telling nobody nothing.
Don't be afraid, my son.
- Nobody's more powerful than God.
- l don't know about that.
Your guy's
bigger than my guy up there...
but my guy's bigger than yours
down here.
You got a point. Five Our
Fathers and five Hail Marys.
For a murder rap? Not bad.
- What did you say?
- Bye, Father!
lt was great to be Catholic
and go to confession.
You could start over
every week.
Hey, kid!
Sonny wants to see you. Nobody's
going to grab that bike.
They're good kids.
They just did some work for me.
- Put them in.
- lt's up to you.
Here's the kid, Sonny.
Go ahead. Don't be afraid.
How you doing, kid?
Good.
We finally meet face-to-face.
Are you afraid of me?
- No.
- That's good.
What's your name?
Calogero.
That's a big name.
You got a nickname?
- What do your friends call you?
- Calogero.
That makes sense.
Are you a Yankee fan?
Sit down.
Come over here.
Sit next to me.
You must be pretty upset
after the Yankees lost.
Bill Mazeroski, l hate him.
He made Mickey Mantle cry.
The papers said the Mick cried.
Mickey Mantle?
That's what you're upset about?
Mantle makes $100,000 a year.
How much does your father make?
- l don't know.
- You don't know.
lf your dad needs money, go ask
Mickey Mantle. See what happens.
Mickey Mantle don't care about
you. Why care about him?
Nobody cares.
Can l ask you something?
Sure.
Did you shoot that man
over a parking space?
When you get older,
you'll understand.
From that day on, l never felt
the same about the Yankees.
l started spending a lot
of time with Sonny.
l would come home from school
and sneak away any chance l got.
l would serve the guys drinks and coffee
for tips.
- Bet!
- l'll lay a hundred.
Come on, Sonny!
- Son of a bitch!
- l don't believe it!
l should break his arm.
Here, kid, this is for you.
- Loan me a hundred.
- You know what's gonna happen!
- l feel it! Please!
- Give him a hundred.
- l'm in, l'm in!
- Go ahead. Give him the dice.
- Give him the dice.
- l'm in!
-lt's fucking hot.
-Come on, Mush, make a donation.
- Get this over with, Mush.
- Come on, dice.
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
Come on, seven!
Come on! Come on, dice!
- And seven!
- l don't even have to look.
- Craps! l'm out!
- Get out of here.
- Get him out of here!
- Man never hit a number in his life!
Bring the dice up here.
Where's the kid?
-Put this coffee on my tab?
-Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.
Where's the kid? The kid's
gonna throw the dice for me.
Sonny, don't let this kid
throw the dice!
- Anybody got a problem with that?
- No problem.
l want you to throw the dice for me.
- l don't know how to play.
- You don't have to know.
You just listen to me.
Hear what l said?
Put 500 down on the kid.
l got a hundred!
Can you stop fucking
leaning on me, please?
- You're breathing all over me.
- Hey, JoJo, relax!
l'm trying to get a bet in.
l wanna play too!
You got to hit the wall, kid.
You can do it. Hit the wall.
- You can do it.
- Wait!
l'm betting on Sonny.
l don't want your money
touching mine.
What, it's counterfeit?
My money's no good no more? Why?
Because you're
a fucking jinx, that's why!
Put him in the bathroom!
Get him out of here!
Get in there,
you fucking loser mutt!
Leave him in there!
- A fucking jinx!
- Shoot the dice.
That's a lot of money on you.
Come on.
- Roll a seven. Come on.
- Shoot the fucking dice.
Seven!
Bring the dice up.
Put $1,000 on seven.
You can do it, all right?
You--
Stop fucking breathing on me!
You're killing me over here!
l'm on a win streak.
Stop breathing on me!
- Put him in the bathroom.
- Eddie's in there. He won't fit.
l don't give a fuck!
Put him in there!
Give me a another seven.
Shoot the fucking dice!
Come on!
We got a four! That's all right.
Four's what we got.
- Let's go! Shoot the dice!
- Give the kid another shot!
What's wrong with this money?
What, is he crazy?
ls it counterfeit?
l say the kid makes the four.
Give me $500.
Get your bets down.
- Twenty-two on the hard four.
- l'll lay a hundred.
- Who wants a gag on the four?
- One-forty, no gag.
Put it down.
- l say he makes the hard four.
- He'll never make it.
- Come on. You can do it.
- Don't worry. l'll throw a seven.
- No seven!
- Yeah! Hit a seven!
- Shut up!
- Quiet!
- Do you believe this kid?
- Nobody laughs at this kid.
Seven's are not good now.
- Hit the wall.
- Get a four.
Make the point.
You can do it.
Frankie Coffeecake, no good.
l don't want his face looking
at that face when he's throwing dice.
Jimmy, get a towel from the bar.
Put it over his head.
l don't want a towel over
my head. lt's embarrassing.
Put him in the fucking bathroom.
Wait a minute. l got money here!
Get the fuck out of here!
- Get him the fuck out!
- Put him in the bathroom.
Get over here.
- Rat bastard locks us in here.
- Very degrading.
l need that point. Listen!
See that money over there?
See that money?
Are we going to make this point?
Come on. Attaboy!
- Come on!
- l need a 2-2 on the hard four.
Hey, don't get cocky, kid!
Fucking kid.
Just make the point. Go ahead.
l don't fucking believe it!
He did it!
Eleven. l made eleven
passes in a row.
l don't know how much money
Sonny won, but it was a lot.
He said the working man
was a sucker...
and l was at the best school:
the University of Belmont Ave.
l was getting two educations:
from the street and from school.
That way l'd be twice as smart
as everybody.
Hey, kid, you did good.
- Thanks.
- Here.
That's it?
Here.
All right?
- Go home. lt's getting late.
- See you later.
Listen.
We got to fix your name.
From now on, you're C.
- C?
- That's right. C.
Go home.
So long, Sonny.
Sonny took me everywhere
and introduced me as his boy.
l noticed strange things started
happening in the neighborhood.
Hey, Calogero, come on over.
l want to talk to you.
My name is C.
l mean C.
- How are you today, my boy?
- Good.
l got nice peaches
for your mom.
l don't have any money.
You don't need no money
with me, kid.
Don't embarrass me
like that again.
Just tell Sonny
that l took care of you.
l saw it was because of Sonny
that everyone was being so nice.
l liked it.
l liked it a lot.
Mommy, look what l got.
Some peaches for...
free.
- What's this?
- What's what, Dad?
Where did you get this? Your mother
found this behind your drawer.
l've been saving.
$600? Did you become
a brain surgeon overnight, son?
Tell your father
where you got the money.
- l worked for it.
- Doing what?
- Things.
- "Things"? What do you mean?
Oh, things. You know, things.
Don't lie. Just tell the truth
and l won't get upset.
- Promise?
- Would l say it if l didn't mean it?
l work the crap games for tips.
- Crap games?
- What crap games?
What crap games?
What tips?
- What crap games?
- You said you wouldn't get mad.
l lied. Tell me.
- l work for Sonny for tips.
- l knew it.
Weren't you told
not to go near that bar?
- But l worked for it.
- What do you mean?
- You're not supposed to go there!
- l'm taking it back.
-l'm bringing it back to the bar.
-Let's just think about it for a minute.
- What are you saying?
- We could use the money.
lt's not like
he had to do something bad.
You know where this comes from. l don't
want him having that kind of money!
- Let's just think about it--
- That's it!
- Come on.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.
Why do you got to go down
like this? Calm down!
Lorenzo, please!
l don't believe this!
- ls Sonny around?
- l think he's in the back.
We can't accept that.
Your son worked for it.
Right. My son. l don't want him
involved in what goes on here.
lnvolved in what?
Please, l'm not a stupid man.
- Just stay away from my son.
- Hey, you stay right over here.
C, go outside.
l'll speak to my own son.
Calogero, wait outside.
First, l respect you, Lorenzo.
You're a stand-up guy.
But don't ever talk to me
like that again.
l tell your son
to go to school--
lt's not what you say, it's what
he sees-- clothes, cars, money.
He threw away
his baseball cards...
because Mickey Mantle
would never pay my rent.
He said that?
l don't believe this kid.
That's not funny when he has
a bigger bank account than l do.
l offered you work.
You said no.
And l say no now.
Just leave my son alone.
Don't you see l treat that kid
like he's my son?
He ain't your son.
He's my son!
- Get out!
- l'm not afraid of you.
- You should be.
- l know what you can do.
And l would never
step out of line.
But this time you're wrong.
This is my son, not yours!
You want to fight? Get out or
l'll give you a fucking slap!
Stay away from my son!
- l don't care who you are!
- Get out of here!
- Where's my money?
- lt's in there.
lt was mine!
That's bad money!
You can't have it.
- l earned that money!
- Stay away from him!
- Please listen!
- Stay away from him!
- Dad, listen to me!
- Did you hear me? Stay away!
Sonny was right.
The working man is a sucker.
Wrong! Pulling a trigger
doesn't take strength.
Get up every day and work for a
living! Let's see him try that!
We'll see who's really tough.
The working man is tough.
Your father's the tough guy!
Everybody loves him, just like
everybody loves you on the bus.
No, it's not the same. People
don't love him. They fear him.
There's a difference.
- l'm sorry.
- l don't understand, Dad.
You will.
You will when you get older.
l'm sorry l hit you.
- Should l take care of him?
- No, leave him alone.
Sonny and my father never
spoke to each other again.
l never listened to my father
about staying away from him.
The bar was so close.
l'd sneak away any chance l got.
Eight years passed, and
as l grew, Sonny grew in power.
He became a boss,
and l was his friend.
Dion was topping the charts.
The Beatles were changing
our life-styles.
The Yankees were in last place
and l didn't give a shit.
There was change everywhere, but
my neighborhood was the same.
They're off! Kryptonite
comes first from the gate!
- On the outside--
- Here's the kid! We're in!
- C! You get it in?
- Yeah. lt's all on Kryptonite.
- You hold them.
- Look at this horse go.
- Come on. Take it home!
- Look at this one move!
- This horse can't lose!
- You can do it, Kryptonite!
lt's a lock. Don't even worry
about it. We can't lose.
l'm not even going to look
because l know we can't lose.
- Look! He's pulling away!
- Come on, Kryptonite!
Come on, Kryptonite!
Look at him!
Forget it. lt's over.
lt's all over.
Let's go!
- That's it, Kryptonite!
- Come on, Kryptonite!
Bring me luck!
Come on. Bring me luck!
Come on, Kryptonite!
Hang in there!
- Oh, shit!
- Come on! Let's go!
Get the--
He bet the fucking horse?
He bet Kryptonite?
Give me the tickets.
But, Sonny, we're winning.
We can't win. The Mush
bet Kryptonite. Fucking jinx!
- We're five lengths in the lead.
- Come on. We've been "mushed."
Come on. l got to get away
from this fucking jinx.
- Come on, one!
- Fucking jinx!
Come on. You can still do it!
Come on, Kryptonite.
You can still do it!
- Hang in there!
- Come on. Take it home!
Hang in there!
Shit!
- Fuck! This fucking close!
- l don't believe l lost!
l don't fucking believe it!
Hey, C, l got a tip
in the next race for you.
Go fuck yourself!
You're very emotional.
White Birch wins it
in an absolute shocker!
We finally got our own
social club.
We called it the Deuces Wild.
Drinks were a buck
and the jukebox paid the rent.
We only cared
about hanging out.
We would cut class
and hang out all day and night.
Nobody wanted to go home...
because you might leave and find
out later you missed something.
Whoa, look at those broads
over there. They're beautiful!
Yo, get over here!
Come here!
Put it back in your pants.
- Those broads are both pigs.
- How do you know?
- Fuck you, C.
- How the hell do you know?
- They'd fail my test fast.
- What test?
lf you want to marry a girl,
she's got to pass the test.
- l call it the Mario test.
- This l got to hear.
The test is, you take a girl
for a ride in your car.
You pull up to one of them big
You pull alongside it
and get the driver's attention.
Honk your horn. Make sure
he's looking. That's important.
At the same time, put your hand
behind this broad's head...
and push her head down
between your legs.
- Get the fuck out of here.
- lt's for her own good.
Now, if this girl
goes down on you...
knowing that truck driver
is watching...
then she's a pig
who can't be trusted.
You're a sick maniac.
When they're into it, they
throw their hair over their ear.
They did it before. Believe me,
they're fucking pros.
That's the second time
those niggers passed today.
- Who gives a fuck?
- l give a fuck, that's who.
Did they bother you? No.
Today it's one car, then two,
then it's their neighborhood!
- Then they'll fuck our broads.
- They shouldn't be here. Period.
lnvite them in.
Make them have a drink.
Smash their fucking heads.
You want a shot?
Take one. Come back!
Louie? Dumps! Get over here!
Where's my money?
l got to do that thing.
l can't--
This guy owes me 20 bucks.
lt's been two fucking weeks.
You can't dodge me forever!
Fucking piece of shit.
l'll be right back.
- All right, l'll see you.
- Come back.
Take a ride with me.
- Do l have to?
- Yeah, you have to. Come on.
Sit over here.
This music
gives me a headache.
You kids today don't even know
what good music is.
This is good music.
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?
You listening to me?
Can't you call me C?
Everybody does.
Calogero was your grandfather's
name, the name l gave you.
That's why l can't call you
C or whatever it is.
Want to go to the fights?
- Could l let you know tomorrow?
- Do you want to go or not?
- All right, l'll go.
- Don't say it like that.
Don't want to twist your arm.
Don't do me a favor.
She was tall,
she was beautiful...
and she was classy.
But she was black.
And that was a no-no
in my neighborhood.
- Jackie, what's the first?
- 2:00, fellas.
- Two. Your friend's number.
- Who?
- Your pal.
- Don't fuck around.
- Johnny Biscord bet 228 again?
- That's it.
- Again?
- Again.
l'll have better music
next time.
l'm only kidding.
lt's okay, Pop.
See you later.
- Louie!
- My grandmother's sick.
l'll talk to you later.
l got to go do something.
