Stop.
Come on.
How are you?
- Good. And with you?
Legitimation, please.
Of course.
Give it here.
How many times I said now all
you do not throw the ball?
Are you trying to scare your sister?
She cries.
- Of course she's crying.
She is still a baby.
You've also been that.
Yes, Papa.
What is it?
- Nothing.
What is it, Juan Pablo?
I want her to die.
That you should never say.
We are family
and should always take care of each other.
Do you hear me?
Hey?
- Poison shot some cops dead.
Well, how much?
- Two.
Two what? Brigadiers or agents?
Agents. You know Poison anyway.
Agents are a million each.
- Okay, so two million.
I write it down.
- Well, I'll talk to you later.
Ok ?.
What was that about?
Just matters.
I want to be just such a businessman like you.
Pablo opted for all-out war.
He paid for every dead policeman.
There were more than 200 massacred.
There was a mortuary
to be built.
The police retaliated.
My name is Alba Borraga,
born in 1962, in Popay? n.
My father Sandoval, my mother Mar? A.
We have a large tobacco plantation.
I studied chemical engineering
at the University of Cauca.
Do it once more and look at me.
I did it all 17 times.
You engaged me and my wife here.
Sit down and do it again
for it is good.
My name is Alba Borraga,
Born in 1962 in Popay? n.
My father Sandoval, my mom Mar? A.
We have a large tobacco plantation.
I studied chemical engineering
at the University of Cauca.
What do I do with chemistry questions?
Hopefully you bluff well.
Sit down. Again.
It's going better.
We were protecting Elisha because they Escobar
could link to the Palace of Justice.
But we were protecting a communist.
That made us traitors.
Can you imagine.
We go.
Are you done?
- Yes.
Honey, thank you.
Make sure we get Escobar.
- I want him dead.
We have no death squads.
You do not do the US
in Latin America.
What did you say?
- Honey, calm down.
You're angry,
but we must do this.
As if I had what to choose.
There is no other choice.
You may be thinking
to go back to Miami.
They sit in their car.
Wait a second.
I do perhaps.
Just get in.
They drive.
Forward.
I had Connie never have to get here.
She is unsuitable.
He has that red bitch with him.
- Do not do anything stupid.
Keep your head down.
It's so over.
Cut him off. Here to the left.
Disembarking, Murphy.
Get out.
Away from the car.
- You followed me?
Get him away.
- Quiet.
Backwards, dammit.
- Keep your hands ...
Get your hands off me.
You spying on me?
Who do you think you are?
Where is she?
Backwards.
With whom did you speak?
Pe? A.
I have problems with my wife.
Problems?
Your husband was smart
to let him follow.
I hope he's okay.
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you going?
Sorry, I'm American.
I do not speak spanish.
Do you speak Spanish?
Yes.
I asked where you are going.
Popay? N.
Legitimation.
Mrs. Connie Murphy.
Alba Borraga.
Good trip.
Thank you.
- Be careful.
Thank you sir.
She is now in the orphanage.
Beautiful.
And Elisha is ok ?.
Glad you make it good.
Listen, enjoy yourself ...
... and call me every hour.
Call me every hour.
Yes I know.
I love you too.
I'm proud of you.
Day.
Now Connie was safe,
I could focus on C? sar Gaviria.
The only one who then ran more danger
a Colombian cop ...
... was the presidential candidate
Colombia.
Gaviria was for expulsion
the narco to the USA ...
... and we had an interest in
he would win the election.
But in order to win ...
... he had to get the election alive.
Se? Or Gaviria?
That door over there.
You must be Agent Murphy.
Nice to meet you.
- You too.
I am Eduardo Sandoval,
head of security for dr. Gaviria.
What can we do for you?
Maybe our agency
you give means ...
... for Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.
The DEA can not get better
on drug traffickers hunt?
It is not separate from each other.
- Agent Murphy.
Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.
Take a seat.
Your Secret Service has informed us
about safety.
No meeting in the outdoors,
every day one different route home.
After the death of Lara and Gal? N
we knew that already.
Cut it out.
- Exactly.
These men do everything
to kill you.
I know.
We take all measures.
Your government has even
an armored Cadillac offered ...
... that is created for your president.
But driving around in Bogot?
in an American tank ...
... makes us determined not to vote for.
We honestly do not know
how we should respond to it.
I say 'thank you' when I
a new Cadillac will be offered.
Thank you, then.
And this here?
What we need this?
A bullet-proof trousers.
I suggest that you are wearing it.
Thank you for thinking.
We'll keep your advice in mind.
Thanks for your time.
WITH Gaviria IS FUTURE
The audience supported Gaviria
its position on extradition.
He became a target.
But our own target
Jos? Rodr? Guez Gacha ...
... we had detected
Cartagena, through an informant.
Have you ever
heard of a computer?
Someone wanted to sell me one.
No idea what it is.
What's up with you?
It's something technical, like new.
Already on sale?
- Yes, Daddy.
Day, baby.
You look beautiful today.
Calm down, girl.
We do not bite.
Would you like anything else?
- I want you.
No, thank you.
- All right, sir.
I want to fuck her.
There are now more important things,
my boy.
Understood?
Say it. What do you know?
Don Gonzalo, our men are everywhere
on the estate.
It's safe.
We also have men in the city.
What can you tell me about Medell? N?
Same thing, boss.
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc
is looking to Pablo.
Thank you, Navegante.
At your service.
- Make sure we stay safe.
Don Fredy.
Boy, I got a question for you.
Are we sheep or wolves?
Wolves.
- Yes, yes.
I like that.
They're in a house outside Cartagena.
Here, in this place.
He is protected by many people.
Navegante, you work for many years
for Gacha.
During that period, you will have more deserved
we will pay you now.
Why do you want to betray him?
That motherfucker's crazy.
We go there all by him.
I believe him for a penny.
What do you care
why is he doing it?
There are 23 agents with obsolete weapons
finished in Barranquilla.
He has twice as many people
with brand new weapons.
And honestly ...
... I've had enough
for young men to hunt in death.
So we have to be smart.
We need to lure him into a trap.
If we catch him alive,
he gives us Escobar.
And Ochoa's.
The whole cartel.
- Does me no ass, Javier.
I want him dead.
Death does not bother him.
He's just afraid
to have to rot in the cell.
That is the real victory.
- I forgot you're a gringo.
What do you mean?
- What risk do you actually walk?
These are not your men.
You have no family here
you can lose.
If this goes wrong, you get
more widows and orphans.
That's on my shoulders up.
Well ...
... I trust his information.
And I trust you.
But if this goes wrong,
you'll have to live with it.
What do we have?
Guards at the airport
Poison saw there.
Who is this guy?
No idea, but as Poison
retrieves himself ...
... he is very important.
Here is your payment.
It comes with a freighter
to the coast of Spain.
Our trucks bring
from there to the Basque Country.
It's all settled.
the first flight back to Spain.
How so?
You have an appointment with my cousin.
An appointment for this quantity.
What is this bullshit?
Than not.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Sorry for my cousin.
We should not go.
I want you to go to the US.
You'll be safe. Far away from here.
But if you ...
- Happens to me nothing.
We go.
Protect him, please.
Do not worry, that's good.
I walk along.
Day, Dad. I love you.
Gaviria's life was in danger ...
... my wife was with one fugitive ...
... and my partner was in Cartagena.
He had his own mission,
with cops ...
... those friends and relatives
had seen dying by Gacha.
Trujillo example, whose father
and two brothers, all agents,
... were killed in firefights
with the cartel.
We wanted Gacha just as happy
as the narco's wanted Gaviria.
I hated
this guy to ask for help.
Su? Rez was as slippery as an eel,
but without the charm.
Hello, Su? Rez.
- Look who it is.
Golden Gringo.
You do not call, do not write.
I called your office.
I only talk with Pe? A.
I need to know who this is.
I need to ...
Should ...
Must know who he is.
Do you "need to know who he is."
Give me, fagot.
'Must know who he is. "
Back, damn it. Back.
You work for me, asshole.
Did you understand that?
Clear?
Do you know who it is?
You tell me?
Su? Rez knew exactly who it was,
and he was not alone.
Jesus Christ.
- If you want to sew someone ...
... then you take them out.
What is it?
It looks like it
that it Medell? nkartel ...
... an attack on Gaviria
has planned.
Since we know nothing about.
Do your work, then instead of
other agents spying.
What does he mean?
- Never mind, ambassador.
The CIA has us
given these documents ...
... but 90 percent of it
defaced.
I have in the White House.
What is that?
Dick did not.
I get those files.
You read too many spy novels.
Have you read The Spaniard?
How did you get that?
Madam, he's been days in the country.
Together with one top-assassin
Pablo.
Let me see.
- The CIA has information about him.
I now get access or not?
The chamber is, in fact, not white.
He's more ... bordeaux.
Agent Schroeder, you come along?
The White Room
was a secret repository ...
... to the deepest, darkest
Secrets of the CIA.
So secret that 's existence
has never been recognized.
Sit here.
Agent Schroeder keeps you
keep an eye on.
Where are the files?
I think it's still too soft.
- He is sometimes harder.
I do not know, Pablo.
We can surgery
better to postpone.
It's too risky.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.
That's why you become bald.
Very funny, asshole.
Laugh.
How's our boy, mama?
He teaches, but with a heavy hand.
How are you, aunt?
- You tell it.
That has to be able to mingle
among the sons of the oligarchs.
Yes sir.
- He can give us information.
And these clowns?
They are a bit nice to you?
More or less.
What do you mean 'more or less'?
We are kind to you.
Can we eat, Gustavo?
Would you like rice?
Thank you.
Jaimito.
Welcome to the family.
Thank you, boss.
Can you absolutely nothing to do?
No.
As long as we are at war,
we can do nothing.
What a bunch of crap.
Every day people come to ...
... and it is thought that my friends
make it happen.
Let's talk about something else.
Yes.
Eg escape on together.
Now you can.
"Together escape."
Listen to it.
Why would you go off
with a criminal like me?
Why not?
Was it that easy.
I can not just leave.
I know.
It's your wife.
My wife does not interest me.
I mean other woman Pablo.
Who is the woman in the relationship?
Do you?
Gacha was always paranoid
when it was quiet.
He began to wonder things
about Navegante.
How is it, honey?
What are you doing?
I am married, sir.
No problem, I can so
Making widow.
Do not touch me.
Fredy, stay away from her.
Come here.
What is it?
The Search Bloc is here
not Medell? n.
Navegante but said that they were there.
Navegante ...
That's a liar.
He would never betray you.
Fredy, think.
Everyone has a price.
Let's go.
If they want war,
they can get it.
Everyone was interested
in the Spaniard.
He was a member of ETA.
Never heard of?
Who made an art
bomb making.
It was a group of "freedom fighters"
Basque ...
... who wanted to separate from Spain.
Their specialty was murder
public figures.
ETA was behind the murder
the Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco ...
... on the way home, after a wrong ...
... and behind the assassination of Prime Rivera
with one remote-controlled car bomb.
The man behind these bombs?
You guessed it: the Spaniard.
His real name is Ephraim Gonzalez.
He is now famous, and for rent.
Expensive, but the best.
Because Pablo hires only the best.
Pablo's plan was to blow Gaviria.
Only: where, when and how?
I appreciate your concern ...
... but to cancel the campaign
is not an option.
With the new information
the cop Murphy discovered ...
... reconsiders you hopefully.
He performs in Cali, Boyac?
and a dozen other cities.
You are everywhere a target.
We have done everything
what your Secret Service ...
... and Spain's Guardia Civil
recommended.
We also bomhonden
each campaign site, so ...
... that's good.
The Spaniard would not know it?
I know.
Tell me
how can he win the election ...
... if he's hiding
like a scared rabbit for all this violence?
What?
How can he win if he's dead?
I will not mention your wife
that you died on my watch.
You're not responsible.
Thank you, Officer Murphy,
but Eduardo is right.
I venture 't it.
His name is Steve Murphy.
He is of the DEA.
Hopefully you pay for this information.
Su? Rez talks with the DEA.
You know what to do.
He escaped.
They have slain the maid.
Colonel.
A message from the roadblock.
They stopped a car.
The driver seems to be a senator.
Can he identify himself?
- Everything seems to fit.
What's the problem?
There was a machine gun
in the trunk.
Come with me.
Check my papers.
No, I do not know who Gacha.
Why is there a weapon
in your trunk?
You ask why a politician
a weapon in this country?
Please, say.
He's my bodyguard.
- Where's your bodyguard?
You were still in the car?
Listen, agents ...
... if you do not let me go right away,
you will regret it.
Thank you.
Ogenblikje.
- Go ahead.
I do not believe him.
Me neither.
He can his papers
or bought.
What if he really
appears to be a senator?
Then we have a problem.
That's a risk I can not take.
That is true.
Not you.
The next I shoot in your head.
Good.
- Talk, fagot.
I will talk.
I love you, sweetheart.
I love you.
You have a visitor.
It is Don Pablo.
Hello, Jaimito.
Don Pablo.
- Is this your house?
Your family?
- Yes, welcome.
Tell me about them.
This is my daughter Marcela.
What a sweet baby.
You must be very proud.
- Certainly.
Of course.
They can buy soon
what they want, Jaimito.
Thank you, boss.
Can I have a glass of water?
- Of course.
Thank you.
And now you.
How are you?
- Well, you know.
Guys.
Well, Jaimito.
You wear it during your mission.
Thank you.
Really, Pablo?
Thank you.
What beautiful, say.
You must be careful
and may not be noticed.
Of course. I'll do anything you ask.
All right, boy.
Sit down.
These guys are going to explain to you
what should be done.
Tomorrow morning you step
the plane to Cali.
You need to record a conversation.
Quite simply.
Nothing to worry about.
Good.
How do you feel?
- I am very happy.
Thank you for this opportunity, Don Pablo.
And for the clothes.
I consider it an honor
to work for you.
Thank you very much.
Do not mention it.
Good.
Come here and hug me.
Thank you, Don Pablo.
Thank you.
Good evening, madam.
- I wish you well.
Thank you.
See you later, guys.
Take care of yourself.
- Yeah.
Look, sweetheart.
What a nice jacket, right?
- Beautiful. What did Pablo?
You know, we go higher.
You, me and the baby come up higher.
Thank you, my dear.
Look at that.
- Put on.
I have news about Gaviria.
They go to him en route to Cali
kill.
Did you say Cali?
Can I have an interpreter?
Su? Rez, listen.
I can interpret.
Wait, there's someone at the door.
'Tu puerta?
That's the door.
Pablo does not like
if you talk to the DEA.
Su? Rez.
Talk to me, asshole.
Su? Rez, hello?
I want the recordings.
- Coming.
Carrillo and his men came to Tolu
to kill Gacha.
Pe? A hoped him alive
to tackle.
It was her fault, Dad.
Do you still think that?
Let go, boy.
If she had said yes, I did it
not to shoot.
Be a man.
Damn, they found us.
Come on, son.
Everything good?
- Nothing to worry about.
He tries to escape.
- That's him fail.
Bring me a radio, fast.
Correal, one radio.
Come on, Dad. We go.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Stop.
Pe? A, Gacha is in the red pickup.
What did I say? We have escaped.
I'm afraid.
- What?
You're a wolf?
Yes, I am a wolf.
It is a helicopter.
They're going to kill us.
Nobody is going to kill us.
Do not talk nonsense.
Take this.
I see the pickup.
- Keep him on.
Do not let him escape.
Switch 's vehicle.
Did not work out.
We'll do it again.
Stop him. Anyway.
Do not leave me alone, Dad.
- Never, boy. Never.
Take a breath.
Would you like it, asshole? Here, take this.
We are being shot. We go to him
of approaching the other side.
Do not worry, son.
Do not take chances.
He can not escape.
Understood.
Look outside.
What happens, Pe? A?
We got him stopped.
He does not move.
Fredy?
We go.
Son.
You are a wolf.
Asshole.
Fredy, wake up.
Asshole. What do you want?
What do you want? Asshole.
What do you want?
He has no more bullets.
We can catch him alive.
You decide.
Shoot him at loggerheads.
Well, take position in
and patrol the area again.
Everything good?
I can sleep tonight.
This was the first successful
major surgery of Search Bloc.
The country and the world now understood ...
... that the fight against the narco's
had reached new heights.
We are in good shape,
according to recent polls.
We stand at a profit
in six districts of Cali.
That are important
in order to arrive in the lead.
The polls say nothing.
- I know.
The last time we dropped by five percent.
Yes.
Dr. Gaviria.
Stop him.
You may not pass.
Quiet, let him through.
Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?
He can not leave.
How so?
There awaits a bomb on him.
If he goes, he will die.
What are you talking about?
You decide.
But I know that something will happen.
Can you prove that?
I just feel it.
You just feel it.
And if you're wrong?
- I hope so huge.
But if I'm right?
Nervous?
A little, but I'm fine.
Wait here.
You know what to do?
Yes sir.
You should record the whole conversation.
Do not forget.
No sir.
- Good flight.
Will not you come?
No, I had to just
hither bring the boss.
Do not worry.
I'll come tomorrow that way.
Good then.
- Do not be nervous.
Flying is great fun.
Well?
Go ahead. The row is over there.
Good luck.
You tell me, Eduardo.
I lay me down to your decision.
Avianca, flight 203 to Cali ...
... is ready for boarding at gate six.
I follow your instincts.
I rule that he get out of here.
Stay with him.
Well ...
You and I are not the only ones worried.
Your belt, please.
