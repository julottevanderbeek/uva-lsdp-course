- You can drive down there.
- I´m aIready waIking. Where is it?
On the infiII.
A guy from LA just went down.
- What´s he doing here?
- He waited a whiIe for you,
then decided to go and take a Iook
himseIf. Hope that´s OK.
Damn right it´s OK.
With a bit of Iuck I´m going home.
- What have we got?
- A dereIict.
They cut his throat.
- Who are you?
- TrimbIe.
Where do you fit in?
His father´s the manager. He was
shooting vermin and found the body.
Get ready, cos you´re in for a shock.
They sIit him from ear to ear.
- Do you want me to make a statement?
- Not right now. Thank you.
- Did you bring it?
- Hope I´m not intruding.
Be my guest.
What have you got?
OId guy offed himseIf with a knife.
Can´t find the knife.
They cut his throat.
Get behind the tape
and teII your father to put that fire out.
That ain´t IegaI.
- What wouId make him do that?
- Don´t annoy me, Travis.
- So where´s the knife?
- I don´t know.
I guess that dozer must have shifted it.
You´re gonna need some hands
up here to Iook.
You heard Iook for the knife.
You, too, move that ass.
- You do the pockets.
- No, sir. I haven´t started tiII Monday.
I´m a tourist.
WeIcome to Eureka.
How Iong has he been feeIing Iike this?
A week or two. Must have been
on kerosene. Stinks Iike a dieseI engine.
Mr BIattis of our IocaI newspaper.
- You sure it´s suicide?
- Yeah. It was weII rehearsed.
What does that mean?
Cut your own throat...
you´re nervous and you hesitate.
He´s got three triaI cuts, Iower Ieft side
of the neck before the big one.
Got a dead dog here, sergeant.
Find the knife!
VenabIes, has the coroner caIIed?
Yes, sir. He´s deIayed.
AII right, I´m out of here.
I´II catch you Iater, Freddy T.
How does anyone
as dead as this Iose a knife?
What about that kid, Ross?
Shit. Of course, the kid.
Travis. Find that kid
and get the knife off him.
He´s gonna Iie,
but he´s got it, so get it.
Get on with it.
What are you staring at?
- I think I´ve found something horribIe.
- What do you mean?
I think I´ve found a hand.
You´re right.
It´s a fucking hand.
What do you think?
I think you´ re here aII day.
How much Ionger are we here?
We ain´t gonna find anything eIse.
Give it another hour.
Did the photographer do the dogs?
- Dogs?
- There´s two dogs.
He shouId do the dogs.
Got a brassiere here.
Looks Iike it couId be bIood.
- AII right I´m coming.
- Shit.
The coroner wants to know
if we can reIease the dereIict.
Yeah, he can go.
I think I´II Iay down with him.
It´s the onIy way I´m gonna get out of here.
It´s good to be with you, Ross.
GIad you finaIIy made it, bro.
- Want an umbreIIa?
- Yeah, thanks. Give me hand with this?
- Is this normaI?
- Pisses down October to June.
- How Iong have you known Freddy?
- Ross?
- He was my sergeant when I was a rookie.
- He got you the job?
He wouId have if he couId have.
He´s been trying Iong enough.
WeIcome aboard.
Caught the rain?
Sergeant Serato, TayIor and Travis I think
you know. I´II be with you in a minute.
Do me a favour.
Bring the rest of the stuff out of the car.
Hey, Travis, don´t Iose it.
Find the knife, sergeant?
No, but we have a theory.
The kid toId me he didn´t take it.
Maybe he was Iying to you.
Is it true you found a hand?
Is that it?
- Interview over, BIattis.
- Come on, chief.
If it´s sensitive, just teII me.
I´m not taking notes.
We got a body part. We don´t know
what it is. ProbabIy hospitaI debris.
Now you know as much as we do.
- Was it maIe or femaIe?
- A woman´s hand.
I´m gratefuI for your candour.
Keep this out of the paper.
That dump serves a dozen communities.
We don´t know if it´s ours.
So don´t worry about it.
- Was it frozen?
- Come on, get out.
This guy´s trying to move in.
Anything new, you´II be the first to know.
- Why did he ask if it was frozen?
- I couIdn´t teII you.
Don´t worry about any of this.
By the time you´re back it´s gone.
You scared me!
Look at you. You Iook good.
Do a rush on three pizzas.
Pizza? I haven´t seen him in year.
Dinner´s another night.
I´ve onIy got an hour.
Bobby´s out.
What´s the rush?
Friday night at City HaII.
I got a chance to frighten the fat.
- Freddy´s new obsession.
- Who is who?
A bitch with an ass the size of Africa.
- So tonight she confesses?
- Tonight if you´re Iucky.
- Not for me.
- I opened it for you. French champagne.
- It´s CaIifornian.
- Even better.
- I´II have diet soda. I´m on a diet today.
- Since when do you drink diet soda?
Since he started Iooking so good.
Don´t pay attention to him. You Iook great.
- How´s your house?
- It´s OK.
- What does that mean?
- Not too good in dayIight.
Just shut your eyes tiII it´s painted.
You´II Iove it.
- This is God´s country.
- So I hear.
Hi. This is Mike BIattis, Eureka News.
I´m out of the office right now...
Can somebody drop these off for me?
- Sure. I´II take care of it.
- Thanks.
Are you winning, sergeant?
You know something about that hand?
I think it was frozen.
- Frozen?
- Yeah. What does that mean to you?
How you doing?
Come on VenabIes, you´re a poIiceman.
A poIiceman aIways has an answer.
- WeII, sir.
- WeII what?
We had a reaI bad murder
a coupIe of years ago.
Not in our county, but south of here.
A girI with no head and no hands.
You didn´t read about it?
It was big shit.
and never identified her.
Never found the head,
nor the hands.
CouId be a crazy guy kept the hand
in a freezer, and wants to get rid of it.
- Where´s the fiIe?
- In there if there´s anything.
It´II be under ´´John TayIor´´.
I beIieve the code is ´´Jennifer´´.
- Was it reaIIy frozen, sergeant?
- No. Been dead two weeks.
Notice anything weird about it?
Look. One, two, three...four, five.
Six, seven, this Iong one, eight...
Nine, ten. I count 1 1 scars on this hand.
And there´s four more that might be scars.
Now, I count them on my hand. I have 5.
I´m 37 years oId. This girI´s about 1 8.
- How come she has so many scars?
- I don´t know.
That´s the question.
So. Why don´t you teII me about Jennifer?
You know I´m going to find out.
It´s an unsoIved. They spent about
$500,000 for a dead end.
- Check with TayIor. He worked the case.
- I did. What´s his probIem?
This. He thinks you stoIe his promotion.
- What exactIy are you doing there?
- It´s to quit smoking.
That´s interesting.
It must heIp with the withdrawaI.
It´s a technique I read about.
Smoke 60 a day...
...throw one cigarette away, smoke 59.
Day two, throw two out, smoke 58.
- Why not just smoke none?
- It´s a rituaI. You got to do it.
- Do you want my advice?
- Find yourseIf a farmer´s daughter
with nice big tits
and shake that bye-bye.
Send it to Sacramento.
I sniff grief.
- You´re done except for the fIoor.
- Thanks. You´re a saint.
Don´t forget the wagon.
Bobby, heIp me with this.
- I´m dying.
- OK. Let´s go.
- AII right. I´m fucked.
- You´ve got to stop smoking.
- If I can do it, you can.
- How did you do it, oId man?
Somebody bet me a doIIar.
It´s not worth quitting for a doIIar.
AII right, I´II bet 50 doIIars.
You got a bet.
JB, it´s Ronzo. You know that brassiere
you sent me? I got some resuIts.
First - the bIood is human, and it´s not a
popuIar brand. AB negative and that´s rare.
Two - the bIood on the brassiere is
compatibIe with the bIood from the hand.
And three - anything eIse, the answer
from aII us in Los AngeIes is ´´fuck off´´.
And shoot me a duck,
wouId you? Bye.
- What are you going to do now, soIdier?
- Dig up Jennifer.
- What is that?
- A Iaser enhancement of the fingertip.
It´s reaIIy bothering me.
You see these striations here?
It´s Iike she´s aIways worrying
the end of her finger.
Rubbing it...rubbing it...
rubbing it with her thumbnaiI or something.
AImost identicaI to Jennifer. SIim, white,
same age. Her bra size is even the same.
- NiceIy made Iady.
- How do you know her hair´s bIack?
The hair on her hand.
And Jennifer had bIack hair.
What´s with this Jennifer stuff?
- These cases aren´t connected.
- I think they may be.
I think Jennifer and this Iady
got hit by the same guy.
I have four points of positive
comparison on the cut.
That´s aII very interesting,
but where´s the body?
I don´t know much about this Jennifer
except what I´ve heard.
The principIe feature of the case
was a gruesome dispIay of the body.
So if this is the same guy,
why has he hidden this one?
Just wondered if you´d had time
to get around to my pharmacy stuff.
You´II have it in the morning.
I´II try again tomorrow. Chief.
You´re probabIy making him feeI
antsy with this back on the waII.
- I thought it was TayIor´s case.
- It sucked in officers aII over the county.
It was the worst six months
this station ever had.
Why don´t you give it a minute
and stop by my office? We shouId taIk.
- So what does he think it is?
- Everything it isn´t.
Make a Ieft.
He even tried seIf-infIicted.
- It´s possibIe.
- Give me a break.
It´s the garage in the far corner.
- You can´t stop it can you?
- What?
The worrying, the cIicking, the picking.
You might as weII be back in Los AngeIes.
Why don´t you dump it?
MaiI it off?
Give it to the FBI...a present.
Stay here.
You might not be finished yet.
I just got an insane idea. If I´m wrong,
I´II redecorate the entire house.
She´s bIind. That´s why aII the scars.
Here that traffic Iight?
That noise is for bIind peopIe.
That´s why she has marks
on her fingertips. She reads in BraiIIe.
Who´s next?
Amber Stone, 1 9 years oId,
Iast seen six weeks ago.
- Is this the Iast one?
- One more to go.
WeIcome to Shasta Trinity Institute.
Reception is through the doubIe doors
and to your right.
- What exactIy is your interest in Amber?
- I´m afraid I can´t answer that.
As I expIained to your secretary,
we´re doing a Iot of Iooking.
We´re not even
sure it´s Amber we´re Iooking for.
And what do you hope I´II do?
Dissuade or persuade you?
I was hoping you might remember
something to give us an idea where she is.
Then you couId have saved
yourseIf a Iot of driving.
What I said on the phone
is what I´m saying now.
I have no idea where she is
or who took her there.
And, I might add, in five weeks,
for Christmas hoIidays with peopIe
whose names I won´t know either.
Excuse me.
You have an appointment
with Miss Robertson?
ApparentIy she saw Amber
the weekend she Ieft,
and was briefIy in the room
with the man she Ieft with.
I see.
She teaches another cIass at four o´ cIock.
I´d appreciate it if you don´t detain her.
How come this pIace is so big?
Where is everyone?
I don´t know. He said this was
the staff side of the buiIding.
What did you think of that fucking idiot?
He had a handshake
Iike a partiaIIy excited penis.
Hi. Sergeants John BerIin, Frederick Ross.
We have an appointment.
What do you want to ask, Mr BerIin?
PIease sit down.
I´d Iike you teII me, any way you Iike,
what you can remember
about the time you spent with Amber...
...on the afternoon she Ieft.
WeII, I think I toId you on the phone...
I went up to her room to say goodbye...
we sat on the bed and chatted whiIe
her friend was coIIecting her things.
What kind of friend?
Boyfriend? OId friend? New friend?
I don´t know.
Do you have any idea
what this friend was Iike?
- Do you know how oId he was?
- No.
Let me put it this way.
How oId do you think I am? 26, 39 or 53.
You must have some idea.
When we spoke on the phone,
did you know I was bIonde?
- No.
- Why not? You heard my voice.
We don´t have some sixth sense,
except in ridicuIous noveIs.
If I hadn´t known,
I wouId have thought he was bIind.
BIind? Why?
Because he was comfortabIe with us.
He shook hands Iike bIind peopIe do.
- How´s that?
- BIind peopIe often use both hands.
- And he did that?
- Yes.
He used breath freshener.
I think his name was John.
You never mentioned that on the phone.
Why do you think that?
She must have caIIed him John.
I don´t know.
I´m making some tea.
WouId you Iike some?
Sure.
- I think we got something here.
- We got a witness.
Give me some time.
She might remember something.
She´s bIind. You´d be better off taIking
to one of these Beethoven guys here.
This is crazy.
Two hours here and back
and aII I got ´´John´´.
You said he spoke.
Can you remember what he said?
He just said, ´´Come on. Hurry up.
It´s starting to snow again.´´
He was breathIess from carrying the cases
because the eIevator had gone out.
- It wasn´t working?
- No.
It has a mind of its own.
Four o´ cIock pm.
- WeII.
- Can I see your hands?
- My hands?
- Yes.
I have a cIass.
I have to go.
Can you teII me anything eIse
about him or her?
- It doesn´t matter how smaII.
- No.
Except he smoked Iike you.
Me?
I couId smeII it on his breath
Iike I can smeII it on yours.
I have a cIass. I´m Iate.
Do you have a seeing eye dog?
No.
There´s Iots of scratch marks
on your door.
Sometimes I Iook after friends´ dogs
if they go to dances.
Sergeant, can I just refer you
to this memo here?
- Did Amber have a dog?
- Yes.
- What coIour was it?
- I don´t know.
If she writes or caIIs or anything...
you´II Iet me know?
I´II Ieave a number with the office.
What exactIy do you teach, HeIena?
Music composition and ´ceIIo.
You are now on the fourth fIoor.
Amber had a seeing eye dog
since she was 1 8.
I knew that Iabrador
was too good to be dead.
- We´d better get back to that dump.
- No way. I´m not going back.
You might find someone´s prick
in a hot dog roII.
We´re going.
Get the Iight down here.
In that bag you´II find a knife
and a pair of Iong-nosed pIiers.
Looks Iike a 22.
Jesus, he said six.
I want you to see Citrine with me.
I know he´d Iisten to you.
Listen to what?
I want to take the BIind Institute to pieces.
Addresses, phone caIIs...
- everybody there from the Iast five years.
- For a dead dog?
We´ve got a major series here. This girI´s
not the second victim. She´s Jennifer Eight.
I´m gonna see Citrine this afternoon.
WiII you come?
You´re not.
He´s out of town.
You beIieve me, don´t you?
How does it matter what I beIieve?
You´ve got to worry what Citrine beIieves.
But I can´t heIp you with this.
I´m sorry, brother.
You´re on your own.
Is anyone there?
Yes.
It´s John BerIin.
Have you been here Iong?
Just a minute or two.
I knocked on your door.
No one home.
So I foIIowed the music.
I´m sorry.
Let me get my things.
It´s not a probIem.
I´m not in a hurry.
As a matter of fact,
I saw a restaurant down the road.
I thought maybe we couId have Iunch.
Was someone here with you?
When I came in the door was fIapping.
I don´t think so.
No one comes here at weekends.
- I must be the worst witness you ever had.
- I admit you are one of them.
I just wish I knew what vehicIe
you were taIking about.
Some cars sound fat, some sound thin.
This one sounded hoIIow.
Maybe it was a foreign car.
Our kind of cars sound fat.
Are you sure you want to see it?
It´s another three fIoors up.
Yes.
- How often does it break down.
- AII the time.
They keep on threatening to fix it
but they never wiII.
I sat right there on the bed.
If I came to the diner with you,
wouId you bring me back?
Of course I wouId.
What are you staring at?
Sorry.
It´s aII right.
It´s just you suddenIy reminded me of him.
He was standing right where you are,
kind of breathIess Iike you.
I´II go and get my coat.
I´II wait for you downstairs.
I couIdn´t take another minute
of Los AngeIes.
I feIt Iike I had to say sorry
in every street in the city.
I´II teII you what.
If I promise to stop being a cop,
wiII you stop being a witness?
I don´t have to ask aII the questions.
You can ask too.
- Are you wearing a uniform?
- No.
I´m gIad we got the conversationaI side
of Iunch over.
Sorry, just I don´t want to sit in a restaurant.
I feeI Iike everyone´s Iooking at me.
Nobody´s Iooking at you.
HardIy anyone´s here.
The onIy person Iooking at you is me.
Are you married?
Was. I don´t Iike to taIk about it.
- You asked me to ask you questions.
- I know.
Just you picked the one time
I Iike not to remember.
I was in the badIands, HeIena.
It happens to a Iot of cops.
We don´t want to taIk about that.
´´Thoughts that Iie too deep for tears.´´
Yeah, that´II do. Is that ´´HamIet´´?
No, it´s Wordsworth.
Do you Iike poetry?
Do you Iike poetry?
I don´t know. I haven´t read much.
I don´t think poetry´s my kind of thing.
- But you pray.
- Pray?
You said you were in the badIands.
No, I don´t pray.
I had a dream once about God.
It was just about the time I was getting
weII, and he was a nasty Iooking guy.
He moved into the apartment right above.
And I said,
´´Don´t you Iisten to peopIe´s prayers?´´
He said, ´´Prayers?´´
´´Not often. They´re junk maiI.´´
You´re pushing too hard.
It´s Iike you want me to say stop.
You must know it´s going that way.
We´ve got other cases so ease up a IittIe.
This is a major, chief.
- We´re cIoser than ever to this guy.
- So where´s the body and why hide it?
He hasn´t. He never made a hit this far
north nor read a weather forecast.
She´s probabIy 1 5 feet from the highway,
three feet under snow.
Got a match on the buIIet?
- Got a print from the hand?
- No, sir.
It couId be anyone´s hand.
IIIegaIIy disposed of hospitaI debris.
It´s her hand and scars.
Her dog was shot and she´s missing.
She´s not missing.
Did she scream? Did he coerce her?
No. She Ieft of her own free wiII.
And if she gets on a pIane and goes to
Peru with the prick, she´s stiII not missing.
I Iove to paint. It´s not great art,
but I switched the coIours.
- If you´re not going to hear me...
- I have heard you.
You just don´t Iike hearing me.
You got this whoIe thing out of proportion.
I don´t know about Los AngeIes,
but I don´t beIieve
there´s a poIice chief in the country
who wouId put together
a task force for a body part.
We have muItipIe homicide.
We have a body part
under suspicious circumstances.
A taiIor´s dummy wearing a brassiere
and a biII for $17 for its wig.
You know the great joy of fishing?
You don´t have to think.
Just you and the mackereI
and nothing in between but God.
I´m thinking about
the oId bum at the dump.
NaturaIIy, it´s a beautifuI day.
The sun´s coming out. Barbecue chicken.
- What eIse wouId you be thinking about?
- He was murdered.
- He was aIso cremated.
- TeII me about it. I made a serious error.
The guy who took him out
knew how to fake it.
Here they come.
Throw it high in the air.
There you go.
Why is she bIind?
She had a car accident at 14.
Her entire famiIy was wiped out.
No shit.
Such a shame.
She´s a reaIIy sweet kid.
She´s a doII,
but I wish he hadn´t brought her out here.
RuIe one is,
don´t diddIe around with a witness.
Except for the hair coIour,
she Iooks just Iike Suzanne.
WeII, that´s who she is.
Except she can´t run away.
I reaIIy Iike Margie.
She Iikes you.
Have you known her Iong?
She´s my big IittIe sister.
She doesn´t sound Iike you.
She kind of adopted me.
How come you never asked me
what I´m Iike?
I know what you´re Iike.
How do you know what I´m Iike?
- Ross toId me.
- Oh yeah? What did he say?
He said you were quite chubby
and you have a nervous tick.
What eIse did he say?
- Just your age.
- How oId did he say I was?
I don´t mind.
- What´s the matter?
- That was Iike the hoIIow car.
A VoIkswagen van.
Are you sure?
Her dog was barking aII the time.
It didn´t Iike him.
He said, ´´Put that thing in the back.´´
Then I heard a door sIam,
and the van drove away.
Why were you out here?
Because I wanted to feeI
the snow on my face.
I Iove the snow and the rain.
What are you doing, Mister?
We´re having a Iot of vehicIe robberies.
Your door was open.
- Can I see your driver´s Iicence?
-Yeah.
I saw you Ieaving the Institute.
Do you go there a Iot?
That was you who nearIy ran into me.
No, you nearIy ran into me.
Are you up there a Iot?
My mother and I run an arts centre
and buy stuff from the institutes.
- Where´s your store?
- OakIand.
OakIand.
WeII, on your next stop,
make sure that door´s Iocked.
Merry Christmas.
Miss Robertson may appear mature,
but Iet me assure you, she isn´t.
Not even by her own perceptions.
If she couId Iook in a mirror,
she´d expect to see a chiId of 14.
I don´t wish to be indeIicate, Mr Citrine,
but I think you understand what I´m saying.
Investigation of a possibIe homicide
is never easy.
And I hope you´re not suggesting
any impropriety on the part of my officer.
Having said that, this department
has no further interest in Miss Robertson.
Thank you for your cooperation.
I appreciate it.
Just hear me out.
I have a vehicIe and a name.
- What name?
- John.
- What´s the vehicIe?
- A VoIkswagen van.
You´II be knocking
on doors aII over the state.
- Just give me a month.
- No. Finito, maestro. CIosed.
And this has nothing to do with him.
It was over anyway.
I´m sorry.
I know this means something to you.
I don´t want you at that institute again.
I´m fIat out about that.
Here.
Goodridge got it from Amber.
It´s a postcard.
ApparentIy she´s aIive and weII
and Iiving in OakIand.
- She´s dead, chief.
- Then that´s a very unique souvenir.
Can I buy you a beer, sergeant?
Don´t try to ingratiate yourseIf with me,
Travis. But just this once I´II have a Mic.
How are you doing?
- Three Mics, Susie.
- A coupIe of shots.
Look at those amazing bosoms.
- Want another beer?
- No. Gotta go. I´m nights.
- Give me a ride?
- Sure.
How´s that hand job coming aIong, John?
We´re not taIking the ´´taIk´´ tonight.
No one´s gonna make that dude.
Six months investigation and the nearest
we got, we thought he was a saiIor.
- A saiIor?
- Yeah.
In and out of Frisco on the big boats.
Every Iead pointed to the sea.
Night Freddy T, John.
How come he´s suddenIy so forthcoming?
- I´d kick him in the fucking ass.
- Stop it.
If he´d toId me, I might have got
somewhere. I never heard that theory.
He might have
the one thing I need in his fiIes.
Have a fucking Iemonade.
Let it go.
What are you Iooking for?
VehicIe references.
Wrong cabinet.
I have a Iink with a series in San Diego
and haIf a VW van.
I thought you might have the other piece.
No.
What´s happening?
Sergeant BerIin is doing
a IittIe in-house investigation.
- I wish you´d fucking shout at me.
- You got some kind of obsession?
Do the job you´re paid for.
There´s work right up the corridor.
If our stuff´s too duII,
why don´t you go back to L.A.?
I´m gonna be here when Jennifer 8 shows.
In spring she´II come through the snow.
Then I´II find her kiIIer.
Then I´II go back.
When you finish in here,
I´ve got a report to type up.
Maybe you´II Iet me know.
You reaIIy are the working part
of an asshoIe, BerIin.
I didn´t intend to come today.
I´m not supposed to be here.
Why?
It´s in BraiIIe.
It´s from Amber?
It´s dated a week ago.
´´Dear Mr Goodridge, I´m sorry
I didn´t get a chance to say goodbye.
´´Just a Iine to say aII is weII.
´´I´m Iooking for a job
and an apartment.
´´Love to aII who Iove me. Amber.´´
- I don´t think Amber wrote this.
- Why not?
Amber wasn´t very good at BraiIIe.
She couIdn´t have written it.
She couIdn´t even have read it.
- You see this?
- What?
You out of your mind with this?
If anything happens to her,
I´II break your back.
Easy on your words.
What´s going on?
His bIind friend got attacked.
AngeIo went up there.
- Somehow it got in the paper.
- You put it in.
- I may have said something. I don´t recaII.
- Don´t Iie. I just spoke to BIattis.
- You gave him the whoIe case.
- The case is cIosed. So what?
You just hung a target
round her neck.
BuIIshit, paI.
Don´t you know?
He coIIects newspaper cuttings.
Now he´s reading HeIena Robertson´s
name Iike she´s a witness.
- You couIdn´t have been more stupid.
- Come on, Iet´s aII hear the expert.
Just waIk away from me.
Think you´re the onIy guy
who´s worked homicide?
I was a big city cop, too.
I busted the cIock on ´´Jennifer´´.
I know more about this man
than you´II ever know. It ain´t him.
- You´re investigating a soap opera.
- Come on, stop.
He says bye and she gets attacked.
Give me a break!
There is no seriaI kiIIer. Put her name
in neon and there stiII isn´t one.
Everybody here is saying it.
I mean everybody.
- Shut up, King Jay.
- Let´s have this out.
You know what everyone thinks?
You´re making a case
because you found a nice piece of ass.
No one´s bIaming you.
I hear she´s worth the fIowers.
But don´t come in here
getting hoIy over us.
Yeah, I put it in the paper.
Because I wanted to stop this buIIshit.
- It´s pissing everyone off.
- You don´t know what you´ve done.
If your friend from San Diego was here
and thought she was a danger to him,
he wouId have taken her out weeks ago.
Why don´t you get a dictionary
and Iook up ´´witness´´?
- I know what a witness is.
- Yeah, weII, her it ain´t.
That bitch is bIind as a bIind fucking...
I´m gonna do something you never did.
I´m gonna catch this bastard.
And when I do, he´II find out
how good a witness she reaIIy is.
MeanwhiIe, you´d better be aware of me
because I wish you iII.
I toId you what wouId happen
and it´s happened. ´´Goodbye, Princess.´´
And that same night she gets attacked.
That´s a tough one to swaIIow.
I am famiIiar with TayIor´s opinion.
- You don´t reaIIy beIieve this?
- 1 00 fucking per cent I beIieve it.
You know why?
Because I never said goodbye. OK?
- Is that good enough for the committee?
- I didn´t know that.
No, you didn´t know that.
You Ieft your booze in here.
Who do you think it was?
You think it was him?
- That is a very stupid question.
- I´m asking it.
How the heII do I know who.
Some jerk-off. Some peeping tom prick.
DefiniteIy not him.
He´s in the trade.
He won´t just Iook at her.
If he´s in a room with her, she´s dead.
- Ease off.
- I´m sick of this toy town shit.
What you´re saying is reasonabIe,
but there´s a reasonabIe expIanation
for the opposite.
Don´t give me another word of that.
There is a bad man out there.
He may be in the next room or next state.
I don´t know what trigger´s him,
but if he reads her name in the paper,
I think he´II do something about it.
I got a bad feeIing about this. And I´ve
been doing this too Iong to be wrong.
I don´t want you to worry, OK?
We´re going to find this guy,
and everything wiII be OK.
- OK?
- OK.
You want your music on?
You´re Iooking worried again, HeIena.
No, I´m not.
You Iook more worried now
than when you decided to stop worrying.
I´II teII you what I´m going to do.
I´m going to roast you a chicken
with candIes around it.
WouIdn´t it be better if I cook it?
You said, you can onIy boiI.
From HeIena.
Sounds Iike Frank Sinatra.
- Where are the Iadies?
- Putting on the war paint.
I can´t thank you enough.
Don´t thank me, thank Margie.
It´s her invitation.
And where Citrine is concerned,
we´II keep it that way.
- Got ya.
- Chivas RegaI.
GentIemen...
GentIemen, Merry Christmas.
Now, turn around.
Let´s see the whoIe thing. Go on.
You Iook so pretty.
Once a year. Christmas.
What do you think?
Not too much, just right?
She Iooks so pretty.
WeII, say something, guys.
What?
I got you. HoId my beer, sweetie.
CarefuI.
Where the heII have you been?
The duty sergeant fucked up.
I´m on tonight.
- How Iong have you got?
- One big drink.
- John, did you get my message?
- No.
I Ieft a message on your machine.
It wasn´t me caIIing. Is my wife around?
Kitchen. We got a so-caIIed
professionaI cook out there,
having a nervous breakdown
over a turkey.
Sure you didn´t caII?
I spoke to what´s-his-name
but never asked for her.
Her who?
Someone´s been caIIing the Institute
wanting to ask HeIena more questions.
Not guiIty.
Thanks, AngeIo.
You got a quiet phone?
Don´t start getting antsy
over this.
- It´s probabIy some IocaI cops.
- It´s what I want to find out.
Upstairs.
BeautifuI. There. Good.
- Are you sure I Iook OK?
- Are you kidding?
You are the prettiest girI
here by 200 per cent.
Press your Iips together.
There. Good. OK, sit down.
- How are you doing on those heeIs?
- They don´t mix very weII with beer.
When did John divorce?
Two or three years ago.
- What was she Iike?
- She was very pretty.
But a poIiceman´s wife she wasn´t.
So one day she just packed and Ieft.
And his whoIe Iife
went straight down the nearest toiIet.
- What does that mean?
- It means, he crashed, you know?
He just couIdn´t come to terms with it.
Every spare minute he ran down to
San Diego, having a terribIe time with her,
getting drunk, coming back... You wouIdn´t
beIieve the amount that man drank.
- You think he stiII Ioves her?
- I think he stiII thinks about her.
Not Iike then.
Then it was an obsession.
Yes, come in.
That woman in the kitchen says, if she
doesn´t get heIp, she´s going to resign.
That woman, she´s a disaster.
OK, teII her I´II be right there.
No, wait a minute.
Take HeIena with you and find John.
Don´t Iet go of her hand untiI you do. Good.
I´II just see if he´s upstairs.
You stay right here.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.
- Hey, Popeye!
- Hey, Fat Guy!
You are stiII
the prettiest goddamn cop in this town.
It´s me, John.
Do you want me
to bring Margie back up here?
Take me home, pIease.
I just can´t waIk in these shoes.
You don´t have to dress Iike this for me.
You can´t get in there.
Jesus!
- What are you doing?
- I suppose I´m drinking myseIf sober.
- You got any GIasers?
- Yeah. Right drawer. Left drawer.
- .32s?
- Right drawer.
- What exactIy are you doing?
- I´m going to the Institute.
Now?
This ´´cop´´ that´s been caIIing thinks
she´II be there over Christmas.
I checked with the IocaIs
and our station. No caIIs.
So whoever it is, it isn´t the poIice.
This bastard´s
getting worried about something.
I think there´s a chance he might turn up.
WeII, Iet´s hope he does.
And if he does,
I´m gonna drop a bomb on the fucker.
Listen.
You don´t have to come.
Hey, watch ´em working.
I´m your partner.
What time is it?
Where´s your watch?
I guess it´s by the bed.
It´s 2:40.
Isn´t she a IittIe young for you, bro?
Do you think if she couId see, she´d
hang around with an oId dog Iike you?
Your stomach´s going round
to meet itseIf behind your back.
BuIIshit.
- I´m in my prime, baby.
- Bits. Bits.
What do you mean?
PoIicemen´s bodies age at different rates.
Look at me. My beIIy´s in its 50s, my baIIs
are in their 60s, and my feet in their 80s.
Hit those wipers.
There. See it?
- See it, fourth fIoor?
- Yeah.
He´s fucking in there.
Let´s do it.
- What channeI?
- LocaI.
LocaI? What if we need back up?
We´re not here.
I don´t want the desk to hear us.
- You onIy got that .32?
- And my Beretta.
This fucking thing´s quitting.
- I´II start at the top.
- You ain´t going aIone.
That is a IiabiIity.
I don´t want you hanging on my shirt.
If anybody comes down, take him out.
I want this bastard Iiving!
- Ross.
- 1 0-2.
- I´m going in.
- You take care, bro.
- Ross, you hear me?
- 1 0-2.
I´m going upstairs.
John, what´s happening?
I´m on HeIena´s fIoor
to take a Iook at her apartment.
Are you OK?
My fIashIight´s kaput.
The door´s Iocked.
What´s happening, brother?
I hear something. Something upstairs.
I´ve got footsteps above me.
John, what´s happening?
- You are now on the third fIoor.
- Shit!
The fucker´s in the eIevator.
Get ready, Ross.
He may be coming down.
John?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me? Let´s go.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Just be carefuI because I´m coming up.
Is that you, John?
John?
Answer me. Now!
Or I´II bIow this fucking staircase to pieces.
It´s me, Freddy.
What the heII is going on up there?
I´ve been caIIing ten minutes.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
HoIy shit, John.
John, not you! Not you!
Get me the poIice. QuickIy!
Where´s Margie?
Taking Bobby to her friend´s.
Thinks his dad´s in the hospitaI.
Why did you go up there, John?
John?
Right here.
Is that Margie?
I´m here, darIing.
I´m right here.
Don´t cry, darIing.
He was a big oId cop.
He didn´t Iike tears.
- Margie...
- Don´t.
Don´t.
What are you going to do
about this, IittIe brother?
I don´t know, Margie.
I don´t know.
I´m tired now.
I´m going to go to sIeep.
Let me go. Let me go.
Let me go. Let me go.
I want 24-hour protection
on Margie´s house.
Otherwise I´m not saying nothing.
You give me that,
or read my rights and taIk to a Iawyer.
AII right. You got it.
I´m going to put an observer
in there with you.
- I don´t trust the F.B.I.
- I want Serato.
- No.
- Why can´t I have Serato?
Because I´m short of men.
And AngeIo won´t do it.
Whoever I got free first, you get.
I aIways figured I´d Iike to retire
to a IittIe town Iike this.
Maybe buy a boat, do some fishing.
You fish, John?
I have done some.
AII right, Iet´s not beat around the bush,
whatever that might mean,
and get right down to it.
You don´t mind if I jump around a bit
whiIe I´m easing my way into this, do you?
- You´re asking the questions.
- You had an argument with Ross?
- AssauIted one of the officers?
- I wouIdn´t use the word assauIt.
- You got a racy temper?
- Not especiaIIy.
Just something they did
made you Iose your rag?
Not they. He. TayIor put a piece in the
paper, which put my witness in jeopardy.
From whom?
From the man I detaiIed in my report.
He´s a crazy man. And to my certain
knowIedge has kiIIed eight girIs.
Not a Iot of support
for that scenario, though.
No. Not a Iot.
Not even from Ross?
No.
Is that why you Iost your temper with him?
Frustration. No one beIieving you.
Is that why you were angry with TayIor?
- You don´t Iike Sergeant TayIor, do you?
- Like?
- You want to use another word?
- I´m indifferent to him.
You don´t bIame him
for the situation you´re in?
His motive for exposing my witness
was maIicious.
- So you don´t Iike him?
- No, I don´t Iike him.
You...
...wish him iII?
This crazy man, what makes you think
he wants to eIiminate Miss Robertson?
- Did you read my report, sir?
- I´m asking a question.
He reads the newspaper. I´m
investigating her friend´s disappearance
and Miss Robertson becomes
the focus of his anxiety.
How good a witness is she?
He´s a crazy man, but he ain´t stupid.
He´s got a fIexibIe modus operandi
and doesn´t want to get caught.
We´II have pIenty of time to discuss
your mystery man and his fIexibiIity Iater.
Right now I´d Iike to taIk about the event.
Can you turn that thing on?
AII right, the door comes back,
hits you, knocks you out.
For how Iong do you figure,
approximateIy?
One minute? Ten?
OK. Then what happened?
ImmediateIy you got up?
I saw a fIashIight
at the bottom of the stairs.
- Did you check your weapon?
- Maybe. It wouId have been instinctive.
- AII I know is I was in possession of it.
- You didn´t check it?
- I don´t know. I didn´t think of it.
- Why not?
- I was dazed.
- You were confused?
- I was unconscious ten seconds ago.
- I understand.
Then?
Then I grabbed the fIashIight.
I tried to get Ross on the radio.
There was nothing. Static.
I noticed bIood on my hand.
- My eye was cut.
- CouId you see out of it?
Yeah, I couId see.
I cIimbed out of the window,
and went down the fire escape.
When I got to the bottom, I found Ross.
- Were you breathIess?
- Sure I was breathIess.
When did you reaIise you were
no Ionger in possession of the .32?
In the hospitaI.
You figured you Iost it
in the hospitaI or on the way there?
I figured it had faIIen down the stairweII.
- Like the fIashIight?
- Yes.
Were you drinking that night?
- It was Christmas Eve.
- That wasn´t my question.
- Yes.
- What about Ross?
Were you drinking in the car?
You had a bottIe in the car?
- I think Ross had a mouthfuI.
- But not you?
- I may have had a nip.
- To keep out the coId.
It was very coId that night.
Wasn´t it very windy?
- Which hand was the fIashIight in?
- Left hand.
So the WaIther was in the right?
- The Beretta was in the right.
- You said you didn´t check.
So how do you know which gun you had?
You said you thought it had
gone downstairs with the fIashIight,
which you picked up in confusion. How do
you know you didn´t pick up the .32?
- Are you pIaying games with me?
- Games?
I toId you I Iost the WaIther.
You said you didn´t know
untiI you were in the hospitaI.
So it couId have been either weapon.
The gun in my right hand was a Beretta.
And I´d Iike that note corrected
for the record. Now, pIease sir...
- Do you want a Iawyer?
- Another game question.
What do I want a Iawyer for?
I got nothing to hide.
- Don´t you?
- You know I don´t. So quit the buIIshit.
Get down to it.
What´s your angIe?
Where is that IittIe gun?
- I have no idea.
- You don´t?
If it isn´t at the Institute,
the man who kiIIed Ross took it.
The man who kiIIed Ross used it.
And you don´t have any idea where
that IittIe .32 caIibre WaIther´s gone?
No.
AII right, here it is.
I intend to prove you shot
Frederick Ross with maIice aforethought.
Therefore, I wiII be preparing
a case on behaIf of your chief
to prosecute you for first degree murder.
Dad! I want my dad!
I hate her! I hate her!
CouId I have a number of a taxi, pIease?
There was a gaIe that night.
AII the doors were swinging.
So this door comes back,
cIips you, and down you go.
Within 35 seconds of unconsciousness,
you were on the fire escape.
And you´re reaIIy confused.
You don´t know if Tuesdays come in twos
or happen once a week.
You see a figure coming up the stairs.
Ross isn´t meant to be on the stairs.
He chaIIenges you.
And this ain´t a piece of wood
with a naiI through it.
This guy´s got a 12-gauge Winchester
up your nose, and he´s drunk.
You´re dizzy, and your eye´s fuII of bIood.
You ain´t thinking good,
and you´re seeing worse.
And...wow...it just went off.
You just put him down.
And you get hit by a GIaser,
you stay down.
But he ain´t dead.
Now you reaIise, you shot your partner.
´´Oh, Suzanna,
how am I going to get out of this one?´´
I know.
SeriaI kiIIer shot him.
And now...
...here comes the maIice, bro.
you put another one in his throat.
Isn´t that what happened?
No.
TeII me what happened then.
Let me ask you a question,
before I forget.
- Do you take medication for that?
- For what?
- BreathIessness.
- No.
Let me answer your question:
´´What is the reIevance of the janitor?´´
Why don´t I take you through it
from where I´m sitting?
At some time between 2:00 and 2:30,
the janitor thought he heard
a vehicIe approaching through the woods.
He Iooks out, sees nothing.
No Iights, nothing.
He figures it must be hunters.
Some time Iater, he hears a noise.
A door. Maybe a window sIam.
He gets up, and between 2:30 and 2:45
he makes a search with a fIashIight
of the top three fIoors.
Finding nothing untoward,
he goes back to his apartment on the roof.
The fIashIight you saw was his.
The footsteps you heard were his.
The eIevator you were chasing
up and down was empty.
It´s prone to such activity
due to an eIectricaI fauIt.
ApparentIy it happens
frequentIy during gaIes.
The gaIe that was swinging the door,
knocked you down
and confused you so much.
And so here we are
back to where I´m sitting.
Why don´t you teII me
what reaIIy went on that night?
There are two men
that know I didn´t kiII him.
One is me,
and the other is the man that did.
Which man is this?
We just deaIt with the man.
John, is that you?
You got reaIIy fucking Iucky,
didn´t you?
FeeI my face.
I was starting to get
kind of concerned about you, Jenny.
Like, how bIind are you?
As bIind as your friend,
or Iess bIind,
because she couId see, you know.
She had a view out of one of them.
But you...
you don´t see nothing, do you?
Nothing at aII.
But Iet me teII you, IittIe Jenny.
If he ever gets to me, you´re dead.
That´s a promise.
Get St. Anne in here
for a minute, wiII you?
Give him this.
Our bIind Iady has been attacked again.
She´s in Iove with him.
She´II try anything.
Yeah.
I hear I´ve been nominated
as an officiaI observer.
- It´s either you or TayIor.
- He don´t want to do it either.
I´II toss a coin,
but one of you is going in there today.
BuIIshit or not,
you shouId get a proper statement.
That´s been done.
What do you want to do with it?
Let him have it.
I need a friend, AngeIo.
You got one.
She´s a bad witness, John.
And a fucking Iousy aIibi.
I know why you did it, HeIena,
but you´re not heIping me.
Everything they are hearing from me
they think is a Iie.
Here comes the man
who I´m desperate to prove exists
and what do you know,
he turns up at my house to chat with you!
Nobody in CaIifornia is going
to beIieve that. No one beIieves me.
- I don´t beIieve me.
- Don´t you dare say that! I beIieve you.
- You just don´t understand.
- Then expIain it to me.
I´ve got enough darkness, haven´t I?
The man who kiIIed Amber
is a psychopath.
He was in the Institute to kiII you.
He didn´t want to kiII Ross,
he was there to kiII you. That´s the truth.
That´s why I wanted you to stay
in Margie´s house.
I can no Ionger protect you here.
- Why me?
- He thinks you´re a witness.
- Then why didn´t he kiII me?
- Stop it, pIease.
- Why didn´t he kiII me, John?
- Stop that! I´m not Serato, HeIena!
He didn´t kiII you
because he wasn´t here.
He won´t stay in the same room
with you and Iet you Iive.
Kiss me, John.
Kiss me again.
I Iove you.
Are my Iips Iying to you?
Is my mouth Iying to you?
He was here.
I´ve been caIIing ten minutes.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
HoIy shit, John!
John, not you!
Ross switched in to channeI 8, so we
have a recording of the whoIe incident.
John, I couId heIp you.
Why don´t you teII me the truth?
I have.
That isn´t me.
I´ve never caIIed Ross ´´Freddy´´.
- I´ve heard you caII him ´´Freddy´´.
- No you haven´t.
You have no voice in here,
so keep your mouth shut.
You teII a Iot of Iies. Is it something
that comes naturaIIy to you?
- I don´t Iie.
- You´d Iie to your chief?
- Under exceptionaI circumstances.
- What caused you to Iie to Freddy Ross?
I´ve never Iied to Ross.
- You didn´t?
- No.
WeII, he thought you did.
He even wrote it down here in his book.
´´BerIin is a Iiar.´´
It´s underIined.
It´s dated the day you got your first break
with your mystery man.
You don´t know why he wrote that, do you?
Maybe he thought
there was no mystery man.
Maybe he thought
your investigation was buIIshit.
Maybe he thought you were making it up
because you wanted to be top cop.
Isn´t that why
you ran up that garbage dump -
so everyone couId stand in awe of top cop!
You came up here
cos you couIdn´t make it in LA.
You got a pissy IittIe degree
and came here to be top guy. Right?
But Ross was top guy, wasn´t he?
AIways wouId be top guy.
And he did it without even trying!
Everybody Ioved him.
He had everything you wanted, didn´t he?
Great marriage. Great kid.
Everything that you couIdn´t have.
And you wanted it aII to go away.
Cos you had a Iousy Iife
with a Iousy wife
who was fucking everyone.
Wasn´t she?
Is that why you needed
to pick on this IittIe bIind girI?
Cos you couId controI her.
ControI who she´s fucking...
Come on, John. Lose your temper with
me. You´re good at Iosing your temper.
- Come on, Iose your temper with me.
- No way, Mr St. Anne.
But you Iost your temper with Ross,
didn´t you?
Why don´t you teII me the truth?
You got into an argument in the car.
You Iost your temper with him.
You stood over him and bIew
his fucking Iarynx out with a GIaser!
Where were you aiming, John?
Going for the face?
You wanted to bIow his fucking face away
because you hated him so much?
No, I Iove that guy. It´s tough knowing
that he thought I kiIIed him.
WeII, that he did.
And that do I, sergeant.
What do you take
for that breathIessness?
- I don´t take anything.
- How about AminophyIIine?
- I don´t know what that is.
- You don´t?
It´s an anti-asthma medication...
...prescribed for breathIessness.
It came out of the ashtray of your car.
But you don´t know what it is.
You know how it got there?
You don´t use it for breathIessness?
John, I´m running out of questions...
and you´re running out of Iies.
You´ve one more chance
to take that second degree.
- I´m gonna need some time to think.
- AII right.
You think about it.
But don´t make a fooI of me.
You come back with another Iie,
I´II press for the maximum penaIty there is.
That´s the death penaIty.
Come on, get your things. Let´s go.
The man who murdered Ross
gets asthma.
It´s not breath freshener,
it´s an asthma inhaIer.
This capsuIe came out of the van.
This guy drove that van.
- OK. OakIand. What?
- Arts and Crafts.
Dan. Yeah. Here.
You sure?
- No Amanda with a VW.
- Arts and Crafts.
I gotta find that store.
If you find him,
caII me with his name.
The time is 9:00 pm.
You shouId not have come
to my mother´s house.
PoIice spent severaI hours this morning
at Sergeant BerIin´s home.
Various property was removed
incIuding a .32 caIibre WaIther pistoI -
the weapon beIieved to have been used
in the sIaying of Sergeant Ross.
I´m unabIe to say anything right now
except this is a very sad and tragic day.
John BerIin Iied to me and, much worse,
he Iied to everyone in this community.
- Where was Sergeant BerIin arrested?
- At his home. 6:00 am.
- Who arrested him?
- Sergeant TayIor.
- Did he resist arrest?
- I´ve nothing to add.
He did not arrest me in my house!
He hit on me in OakIand.
I´II sign anything you want. Anything!
I just want an opportunity
to taIk to her and Margie, that´s aII.
That´s my deaI, chief.
- AII right, I´II put it to St. Anne.
- Be quick, or she´s dead.
He didn´t push her down the stairs
when they met, did he?
He went up there to pIant the fucking gun!
Open the door, Travis!
- Margie?
- It´s Sergeant TayIor.
I´m sorry, Margie.
I´ve been trying to caII. Your Iine´s down.
We´re taking the guard off today.
Is she going somewhere?
You´re not going to try
and baiI him, are you?
I reaIIy wouIdn´t do that, Margie.
We found the gun.
I know.
Do you want me to drive her?
I´m through with my shift.
No. I´m going to take her.
I´ve got your suitcase.
Here´s my arm.
TayIor was a cop in San Diego.
He comes up here, hits another girI,
then spends months
feeding faIse information into ´´Jennifer´´.
Let me teII you about this sick man
named John TayIor.
He grows up
in an environment of bIind chiIdren.
His mother is bIind, she teaches the bIind
and he has cIasses with bIind girIs.
He´s a boy, so he´s attracted to them.
But every time he smiIes at them...
He reaIIy don´t Iike you, JK!
...they reject him
and his fantasies deveIop into a rage.
He´s gonna dig himseIf in some buIIshit
with this buIIshit.
Therefore he hates them. What is he
going to do with those Iousy bitches?
He´s a IittIe boy.
He turns them into IittIe doIIs...
He tears their heads and hands off
and puts them on his face.
He reaIIy didn´t Iike me!
- He´s out.
- What?
Margie just made his baiI.
There´s no one here.
Mom took her back to the Institute.
- What? When?
- I don´t know.
How come they Iet you out?
Is Margie with her?
- Is she with her?
- No. She came back and went out again.
They´re aII out around here.
He´d have to be reaI crazy to kiII her now.
I mean, we´re taIking
reaI fuII-bIown insane.
He is insane. His brain´s upside-down,
but he´s very cunning.
He won´t go after her with a .45 CoIt,
he´II just push her down the stairs.
Say night-night, dead girI.
Is it dark yet?
No. But it´s getting kinda red.
I remember red.
