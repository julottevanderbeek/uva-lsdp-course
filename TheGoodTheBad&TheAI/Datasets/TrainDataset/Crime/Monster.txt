Based on the true story
I aIways wanted to be
in the movies
When I was IittIe I thought for sure
Or maybe just beautifuI...
BeautifuI and rich,
Iike the women on TV
Yeah, I had a Iot of dreams
And I guess you can
caII me a reaI romaniac
Because I truIy beIieve that
So I dream about for hours
It was the year whiIe I Iearnt,
I shared thing for peopIe
They said I was dreaming
But back then, I beIieved
that whoIe heartiIy
So whenever I was down,
I was just escape into my mind
To my own Iive, where
I was someone eIse
They maybe happiIy think
that aII these peopIe...
They didn't know that
who I was gonna be
But 1 day they'II aII see
I heard that MariIyn Monroe
was discovered in a soda shop
And I thought for sure,
it couId be Iike that
So I started going up
reaI young...
But I aIways secretIy Iooking
for who is gonna discover me?
Was it this guy?
Or maybe this one?
You never knew
They couIdn't take me
aII the way Iike MariIyn
They wouId somehow
beIieve in me just enough
They wouId see me for what I couId
be, they think I was beautifuI
Like a diamond in
a rough
They'II take me away...
To my new Iife
And my new worId
Where we think wiII
be different
