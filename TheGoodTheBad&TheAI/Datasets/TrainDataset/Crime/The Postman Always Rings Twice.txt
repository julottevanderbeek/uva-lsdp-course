Sorry to bother you.
You want a cup of coffee?
Yeah, thanks.

I got to cover a bet.
-I can't talk to you about it just now.
-Frank, I can't go out there broke.

Oh, I must've skipped you.

Wait a minute.
Are you leavin' with the money?
Well, I won it.

Fuck you, Commodore.
I won this money.
All right?
It's all right with me, pal.
-Good meetin' with ya.
-Come on, Jim.
Wait a minute. Let's play.
Did you see that good-looking girl
that I was talking to leave here?
No, I don't know where she went.
Okay, you can turn 'em on.
I told you we shouldn'a hooked this
up in the rain in the first place.
Finish up, already.
-You check the connections?
-Yes, I checked the connections.
-Did you check the switch?
-I checked the switch.
Well, go check the hookup.
Your boss say, "Sign work both

-Want a cup of coffee, Nick?
-Turn 'em on.
He's checkin' the hookup.
Well, hurry up.
I wanna see lights on.
Turn on.
Where the hell is it, anyhow?
Go around there,
he said it's around to the left.
Yeah, I think I've found it.
He would have found us anyway.
You don't know him, Frank.
He would've followed us,
and he would have found us.
Don't lose sleep over it, Cora.
I'm just disappointed.
I thought we had somethin'.
You just don't know what it's like.
Bein' a woman,
trapped in this kind of...
You don't, you don't know.
There's always a way, Cora.
If we stick together.
I didn't know what to do.
Cora!
I've got to have you, Frank.
If it was just us...
If it was just you and me.
What are you talking about?
I'm getting tired
of what's right and wrong.
They hang people for that, Cora.
Cora!
Come here!
Hey, Frank, it look good
from here, uh?
Yeah. It's a hell of an idea you had.
Hey, neon, huh? Neon.
All right?
Ah, ring twice for danger.
And the door?
Locked from the inside.
And then down the ladder
and that's it.
-Yeah.
-Okay.
Do you love me, Frank?
Sure.
You know I do.
Don't worry about anything, okay?
Don't tell me that.
Evening.
You knew I had to stop here, didn't ya?
She's beautiful.
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?
-Just today.
-Had to be.
What was that?
-There's a damn cat up there.
-Oh, yeah.
Hey, they sound a lot like
babies cryin' sometimes, don't they?
Yes, they do.
Well, I expect I ought to
get back to work.
Yeah, well, we all got to sometime,
that's for sure.
That's for sure. Take care now.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Frank, get over here!
Oh, my God!
What happened to the light?
I hit him! I hit him!
-What happened?
-I hit him and all the lights went out!
Get on the phone. Call an ambulance.
The cop came by and saw everything.
-The cop? What cop?
-Get on the phone!
We're gonna die for this!
Hello, Nick.
Nick, wake up.
Come on, Nick. Come on, Nick.
Nick, wake up.
We'll know for sure
after we see the tests.
It'll be about a week.
All of a week.
Can I have the book, please?
Thanks.
All he knows, it went dark.
If he'd have turned around, Frank,
they'd have hanged us for it.
And something,
something put that cop there.
It's an act of God,
those lights went out.
Don't look back.
-What?
-Don't look back. It's a cop.
-His red light's on.
-Oh, God.
No, no, leave 'em on.
Bathroom upstairs?
Ah, yeah.
What's the ladder doin' there?
I don't know.
Hey, come here.
All right. Sure.
Hey.
Cover's off this fuse box up here.
I'd say that sucker stuck a paw in it.
Fried him deader than hell.
Yeah. How about that?
Must've been those guys
that were workin' on the sign today.
Yeah.
Sounds like that.
Sorry about your husband, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
I'll get a flashlight.
I know it's tough...to go down
and see him.
You're sure you don't want
me to drive?
Hurry back.
Take it easy guys, there's plenty here.
Cut pie. Little portions.
John Philip Sousa.
I don't want to make love tonight.
It's our last night.
I know.
I don't want to make love.
Yeah, you're right.
Me neither.
Oh, Christ, Cora.
It's all in the feet.
You must watch the feet.
-Can I talk to you a minute?
-It is beautiful, believe me.
-You just watch your feet...
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-And you will learn...
-Excuse me.
I can't talk about it now.
What do you mean,
you can't talk about it now?
Four days already,
you can't talk about it.
Yeah, and you don't understand.
I can't do it anymore, Frank.
You understand?
Why can't you do it anymore?
What does that mean?
You can't do it anymore?
-It's over.
-Come dance.
What? What are you talkin' about?
Bravo, Nicko.
Come here.
Come here.
This man saved my life.
I'm fond this man.
Cora, my feets, you know.
My feets. They're beautiful, huh?
-Beautiful.
-You say it.
You say it Greek.
Nick, I can't say it in Greek.
Come on, you say it.
Say it.
That's it.
Come here. Now, you say it.
Is beautiful.
Tonight.
What?
What?
What're you doing?
You're the guy's wife, Cora.
You told me that.
You were gonna leave me?
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?
-Is that what you were doing?
-Cora, look.
Live here.
Live with the guy.
Took a chance, we didn't make it.
Live with the man.
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?
He's changed.
He says the accident changed him
and now I'm supposed to have his kid.
How am I gonna do that, Frank?
How am I supposed to have his baby?
I can't have his baby.
The only one I could have
a baby by is you.
Okay.
Say you won't leave me. Please.
Just stall him, babe.
Just stall him.
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.
A trip. A change of scene.
-Is it much farther?
-It's a couple of hours.
-That's it.
-What do I owe ya?
$1.44.
-Okay. Here you go.
-Be right back.
-Here's your change.
-I'm gonna drive now.
You can't even walk.
What are you talkin' about, drivin'?
-Now, get in the back.
-What?
-Get in the back.
-Are you nuts? Are you nutty?
-Mister, you don't want to--
-I'm drivin' this car home.
-Come on, Frank.
-You don't want to drive tonight.
-You don't want to drive tonight.
-What, do you own this car, big fella?
-Get in the back.
-Just get in the back.
That's it.
You drive safely now, okay?
Goodnight.
-Good wine.
-C'mon, Nick.
Is nothing like to have a wife.
-Cut it out, Nick.
-Don't worry. He's drunk.
-Shit!
-Don't talk like that.
It's boiling over, Nick.
I gotta pull over.
Hey, wake 'im up.
Wake up. The car's stopped.
Come on, wake up.
You gotta fix it.
Frank, get out of the car.
Shit.
I'll fix it myself.
What's a matter...with door?
There, got it...
Is he dead?
Get in!
Come on, Cora, get in.
Drive.
Put it in neutral.
Wait.
