Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.
My name is Jimmy Breslin. l'm a writer.
l write about New York,
the city of my birth,...
..where l've lived and worked all my life.
The city that l love and hate both equally.
Today things are much different.
Business is booming up, up and up.
Crime is down, down, down.
Homicides are the lowest
it's been since 1 961 .
Well, it wasn't always like this.
This film is about a different time,
a different place.
The good old days,
the hot, blistering summer of 1 977.
There are eight million stories
in the Naked City...
..and this was one of them.
Shut that dog up!
Shut that dog up!
Shut that dog! Shut that dog up!
Shut that dog up!
Shut that dog up!
Shut that dog up!
There was something
in the air that night
The stars were bright
Fernando
They were shining there
for you and me...
Wanna go to the beach tomorrow?
- Yeah, let's go to Jones.
- Yeah.

- Oh, l have a hair appointment.
Tsk. Ah, l'll just cancel it.
Yeah.

- Can we help you with something?
lf l had to do the same again

But they banned it from the home
There but for the grace of God

More terror, more bloodshed.
The .-Calibre Killer striking again,

..but the police have not released
its contents to the press.
Parents continue to warn
their children not to go out...
..and keep their daughters home,
afraid they will park in Lovers Lane...
..and end up another victim of the killer.
lt's hot and hazy and humid. People trying
to go out at night, but they're afraid to.
They're afraid
this mad killer will strike again,...
..shooting them down in cold blood.
Good morning, Ma.
Not a good morning for me. l'm losin'.
Couldn't you put some clothes on?
Morning? lt's . in the afternoon.
Nice. Nice tux, ed.
lt's your mother's idea.
She got me a gig with a wedding band.
Can l borrow  bucks, Ma?
- Whoa!
- l gotta get my car fixed.
- Take it from the kitty.
- That's for food!
This is what l mean with this kid.
Ritchie, why not work for a living?
Only the coloured and Spanish sponge.
Mind your own business.
l gotta sing for $ tonight,
and he gets ? No, no, no.
$ dollars, and you should
make him work the game.
All right, but he's not gonna work

Thanks, Ma.
- Hey, Ritchie.

Barracuda!
Get out of the water!
l've been buying
the Post and the Daily News all week.
l wanna get some money back.
You should be payin' us
money just to be standin' here!
- Joe, l been spendin' a lot of money.
- Oh, come on!
Shut the fuck up, all right?
Just listen to this.
''Police officials declined
to discuss the contents of the note,...
..but our unofficial source said
it was written by a homicidal maniac,...
..a real sicko who lives
in a nightmare world.''
- Joey, do l look pale to you?
- You look all right, Vin.
Hey, Anthony, do l look pale to you?
Yeah, you look like a piece of mozzarella.
- You guys are fuckin' funny.
- Holy shit! Look at this.
- This is our neighbourhood.
- There's Layton Avenue.
- Joe, look. We're famous.
- Let me see that.
l'd lay five-to-one
the killer's from right here.
- You think the killer's from around here?
- Don't you think we'd notice a sicko?
What do you think makes them sickos?
You don't notice 'em.
You think this was a random killing?
He just pulled off the highway?
You don't think
he knew where he was going?
- Joey, l need another lude.
- You just popped it.
lt's not working. Give me another one.
Don't be fuckin' cheap!
That was some heavy shit you saw.
- l'd be freaking out if l was you.
- Yeah, l am.
l'd be freaked out
since the killer knows you saw him.
- What do you mean, he saw me?
- He might think you're a witness.
l'm serious. l saw this on a news show.
lf he saw your licence plate,
he knows where you live.
You think l'm number eight?
- They stick around.
- They see who comes by...
Oh, shut the fuck up!
l only saw victims.
l didn't see nobody.
Don't start spreadin' that shit, asshole!
What's the matter? Leave him alone!
Oh, that's real funny, right? Ha-ha!
What's the matter? You can't take a joke?
No, l can't!
- Vinny, relax.
- Come on. We're playin' with you.
Here, here, come on. Take a half a lude.
Go home and get some sleep, all right?
- Fuckin' guy can't take a joke.
- Leave him alone.
One fuckin' lude ain't gonna work on him.
Why don't you guys go
fuckin' take a walk?
We were just jokin'.
Holy shit! Look at this creature!
Hey, guys, l got live lobsters.
- What you got there, Woodstock?
- Live lobsters, $ each.
You stealing lobster traps?
Those guys'll shoot you.
Where were you last night?
You shoot two people?
- l only shoot heroin.
- These lobsters are broke.
- And half-dead. What is this shit?
- They're good! $ each.
Get the fuck outta here

These are good for making brisque.

You ain't Bruce Lee.
Stop kicking Woodstock.

- Don't give us that bullshit.
You come back here lookin' like a freak,
soundin' like a British fag,...
..we're supposed to be OK with that?
You're fuckin' right.
How's your wife and kid, JT?

Moved back in with my mother.
Look, Joey. A dollar each.

All right, all right, all right. Here, here.
Here's your $.
Now get the fuck outta here.
- Woodstock, l need some smoke.
- l'm handling that now. l got nickels.
Right. l'll take two then.
Hey, Ritchie, you heard about the killer?
Yeah, yeah, l heard.
- What's up, Vin? Not gonna say hello?
- Hello.
Where the fuck were you last night, huh?
You drove past me outside the club.
Do me a favour and drop this stupid
accent. Talk to me for real, huh?
All right.
- Why didn't you come in and say hello?
- l wasn't dressed for disco dancing.
l wasn't dressed for dancing!
Look at him! He was dressed
for Halloween, this fuckin' goblin.
Hey, porcupine...
Vinny saw the dead bodies last night.
- You saw the bodies?
-  Yeah, l saw the bodies.
l was on my way home. But l didn't
see no fuckin' killer, you numbnuts!
So don't fuckin' spread that word around.
Hey, here comes Ruby the skank. Ruby!
Yeah, but... l thought you said
your parents were in Hawaii.
First europe, then Hawaii.
You know, Ron,...
we've been dating for three weeks now...
..and all you ever do is take me to motels.
OK? You wanna see me again?
- You introduce me to your parents.
- Must you always bring up my parents?
- Are you getting out of the car?
- Yeah, l gotta go.
What about our weekend in the Catskills?
l've already paid for the room.
Then you can go there
and you can jerk off.
Cos that's what you are, a fuckin' jerk-off!
Fuck you, you dago wop skank!
-  Whoa!
- Hey, what did you say?
- ''Dago wop skank''?
- This doesn't concern you.
- That's my fuckin' sister!
- Stay away from the car.
Get the fuck out of the car!
Get out of the car!
You fucker!
Go back home, pretty boy!
He ain't showin' his face here again!
Hey, Ruby, come over here. l'm horny.
l mean lonely. l need a hug.
Then go home to your mother.
- Twat you say? l cunt hear.
- l have an in-fuck-tion in my ear.
Don't you assholes ever grow up?
What the fuck is your problem?!
- Ruby!
- Hey, is that Ritchie?
- That freak don't want you.
- Get the fuck out of here!
Ritchie, hey! How are you?
- Hey, Ruby.
- How ya doin'? You look good.
- You look great.
- Good enough to eat?
Hey, l like the new look.
What, it's... punk?
Yeah. You should come
to the city sometime.
- Maybe check out my band.
- They suck.
Yeah, they suck real good.
Just like you, Ruby.
- l learned from your mother,... dick.
- You let your sister talk like that to me?
- Come on, get lost.
-  Leave me the fuck alone.
- Hey, you live in Manhattan now?
- l did as of last night. l got evicted.
- Will you stop talking like that?
- You been in London, too?
No, but it's... it's all in the attitude.
lt's all in the attitude.
ln the attitude.
Well, l-l gotta go.
My father's gonna kill me. l'll see you.
- lt was great seeing you.
- Yeah, you too. You look good.
- You take care of yourself, Ruby.
- Yeah.
Be careful.
Ritchie, come here. l wanna talk to you.
Take it easy on the rebound.
- Whoa, whoa.
- You tryin' to knock me down?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
Don't tell nobody.
Now, it's bad enough
that l balled her, right?
But then some sick side of me
had to drive Dionna right past the spot...
..where l was just sticking it
up her cousin's ass, you know?
Shit. And that's where l saw
the dead bodies, right there.
You know what?
God spared me. He spared me, man.
Cos it's a fuckin' omen. No, l'm serious.
He fuckin'... He let me go.
What the fuck could this mean?
lt means something. What does it mean?
l don't know. What do you think?
l think God's tellin' me
that l'm gonna burn in hell...
..if l don't stop cheatin'.
l told you you weren't ready
to get married.
You don't fuckin' listen.
Cos l fuckin' thought l was gonna
stop cheatin' when l got married.
And now l'm just fuckin' cheatin'
a lot more than l ever did.
You know, l thought
the man up there understood.
l thought He would fuckin' understand!
God has got nothing to do with this, Vin.
Oh, come on, Ritchie.
Yes, He does. Yes, He does.
God is tellin' me, ''You shouldn't
be doing these things with your wife.''
- What things?
- Don't be stupid. You know.
You know, butt-fucking,...
..69, doggie-style.
And that's the message.
God is saying, ''Cut that shit out.''
''Otherwise, l won't
spare you the next time.''
That's what He's saying.
l'm telling you, l swear l think
the guy saw my licence plate.
l think he's after me. l tell you, l'm
gonna be number eight. My life is over.
You don't gotta worry about anybody
comin' after you or any omen.
What the fuck am l gonna do?
What if l can't stop?
- What if l got some sort of hang-up?
- You don't got any hang-ups.
You know, once you're deviated,
you can't go back. You know that.
Why don't you just tell Dionna you like
these things? Maybe she'll do it.
- You don't do that shit with your wife.
- Why not?
- Nah, it's a fuckin' sin.
- ''Please, can l put it up your ass?''
- ''Just one time.''
- Don't fuckin' make fun of me, man.
- ''Let me put it up your ass.''
- Shut up.
''Oh, Dionna...''
What do you want me to tell you?
Get a fuckin' divorce.
Divorce is fuckin' evil.
You got some bad advice.
''evil'' spelled backwards is ''live.''
You're a corny fuck, you know that?
Dionna? Dionna, l gotta talk to you.
Vinny, what are you doing here?
- l just gotta talk to you for a minute.
- Now?
Honey, we're in trouble.
We got Luigi here and we're not ready.
- Just sit down with me here.
- Vinny!
What's wrong with you?
l need to talk to you, please.
And listen to me for once, OK?
Could you? Could you do that for me?
- All right.
- All right?
What l saw last night...
made me think about a lot of things, OK?
lt opened up my eyes really wide
to everything.
And those murders made me realise...
..how much l love you.
l love you, Dionna.
And l swear to God...
l swear, l promise...
l promise you and God
that l'm gonna be the best husband...
..that you ever had in your entire life.
lf l had eight tongues, it wouldn't be
enough to tell you how much l love you.
- OK. You swear to God?
- l swear to God, l love you.
OK.
l'm so sorry about everything.
l love you so dearly.
Baby, um,... l'm in the middle of work.
Dad's in trouble and l gotta get stuff out.
Make up an excuse
and let's go somewhere.
- Baby, l can't.
- l'll take you to dinner.
Why don't you stay here?
l'll make you something nice.
l'll be back in  minutes.
Sit down. l'll get you a glass of wine...
- l don't wanna wait  minutes.
- A glass of wine!
Daddy,... Luigi's veal. He's waiting.
He'll wait. He'll wait.
How's that husband Vinny of yours?
He's all right?
Well, he was all shook up,
but he's... he's a lot better now.
- Thank God.
- You don't seem so good today.
How am l doing? l'm concerned, OK?
l'm very worried about your safety.
Did you see those parents on television
crying for their kids?
l don't want to be on the news talking
about the daughter that l used to have.
When's the food coming?
Tomorrow?
Get rid of this thing, too.
lt's disgusting.
- Hi. Here's your order.
- Thank you, honey.
- Beautiful.
- Thank you for waiting.
- Tell your father he's a great man.
- That looks great.
- Thank you, honeybunch.
- So long, sweetie.
Luigi, look who's here.
Starsky and Hutch.
Are we double-parked
outside or somethin'?
You gonna invite us to sit or what?
You both got asses. Feel free to use 'em.
Mario? Mario!
Si, signor Luigi?
Two setups for New York's finest.
Ah, sure, paesano.
You're gonna invite us to a meal?
That's against regulations.
- You sit at my table, you eat.
- Nobody's counting, huh? Sit down.
Detective, you ever have
Veal Sorrentino?
- Uh, no, l haven't.
- Well, you're gonna have it now.
- Sounds delicious.
- That's ltalian for veal delight.
- What is it?
- lt's ltalian food. Veal Sorrentino.
You need your energy to catch
the criminals of the world.
l like that. That's good.
Sorrentino, here you go.
Try to catch this one.
Compliments to the chef. Yeah.
Your partner tell you
he ran errands for me as a kid?
No.
Yeah. When he was a pipsqueak.
Too small even to piss straight.
- No, he never told me that.
-  Never told you other things.
My partner knows l'm from here.
Can we get down to business?
What business?
We need your help.
What do you want me to do?
Arrest myself?
l wish this was a joking matter,
but it's not. lt's serious.
l want to talk to you about
this crazy son-of-a-bitch killer.
We need your help.
You got a hundred cops on the task force.
You need my help? l'm only a plumber.
Luigi, you know l wouldn't be here
if l didn't have to be.
l'm asking you : This guy,
how many people did he kill?
Three, four, five?
And with no disrespect, detective,
in Harlem last night,...
..your people, the coloureds, how many
of each other did they kill? Seven, eight?
eight, nine, at least.
And on Saturday, , if we're lucky.
- OK, l'm out.
- Take it easy. Sit, sit.
So... so...
So... why didn't you ask me
who killed them? Huh?
Not enough press in it for ya?
Not enough Post
or Daily News headlines?
There's a homicidal maniac
runnin' around the neighbourhood.
You don't wanna do anything about it?
You have been busting my balls
ever since you got promoted.
Now, why is that?
Wasn't l good to you
when you were a kid?
Didn't l take you to Yankee Stadium?
Didn't you meet Mickey Mantle?
He signed a baseball,
''To Louie, from Mickey Mantle. ''
Motherfuck the Mick!
Willie Mays was the man.
Get outta here! Mick was the guy.
- He was the guy. Come on.
-  All right, enough.
And the family. Your family...
Didn't l take care of them?
l treated you like a son.
And now you have the balls to come here
and ask me to do you a favour?
Never!
When you wanted to become a cop,
did you come and ask me?
Did you ask for my blessing? No.
And you could have been
a great plumber, as good as me.
l'm gonna read you something,
but it can't leave this table.
Not even the newspapers
know about this.
Read it.
''Dear sir, l am deeply hurt...
..by the newspaper
calling me a woman hater.''
''l'm not. But l am a monster.
l'm a little brat.''
''l am the Son of Sam.
Sam loves to drink blood.''
''Go out and kill,''
commands Father Sam.
Behind our house, some rest.
Mostly young, raped and slaughtered,
their blood drained.
Just bones now.
-
- Papa Sam has me locked in the attic too.
Shut that dog up!
l can't get out.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
When l look out the attic window
and watch the world go by,...
..l feel like an outsider.
l am on a different wavelength
than everybody else.
Programmed to kill.
Do you know where...
No!
However, to stop me,...
..you must kill me.
l am the monster.
- Beelzebub.
- Beelzebub. The chubby behemoth.
l love to hunt.
Prowling the streets,
looking for fair game.
lt must be the water they drink.
l live for the hunt. My life. Blood for Papa.
Sir, l don't wanna kill any more.
No, sir, no more.
But l must honour thy father.
l wanna make love to the world.
l love people. l don't belong on Earth.
Return me to yahoos.
l wanna wish you all a happy Easter.
May God bless you in this life
and the next.
And for now,...
..l say goodbye and good night.
Lasciami. Non mi toccare!
Police, let me haunt you
with these words...
l'll be back.
- ''l'll be back.''
- l'll be back.
To be interpreted as...
..bang-bang-bang...
..bang-bang... bang.
''Yours in murder, Mr Monster.''
- Holy Jesus Christ.
- Holy shit!
Will you excuse me for a minute?
Luigi...
Sugno che oggi ho tanto... Pe' Vossia...
Chisto, chisto madman é uno nostro.
Come on. Aiutami.
Non te preoccupare.
Ci penso io pe' iddu.
Grazie. Grazie.
Basket catch.
Hey, pally, that catch in the ' series...
There's a long drive
way back to centre field.
Way back! And it is caught!
He got lucky!
l'm gonna love you
Like nobody's ever loved you
When you sang that song,
l fell in love with you.
Come rain or come shine
- eddie Sabatini.
- That's me, baby.
eddie Sabatini!
High as a mountain
Deep as a river
Oh, baby, come here.
Da-da-daah!
Just when you met me
lt was just one of those things
But don't, don't you ever bet me

.. was signed by the madman himself,...
..calling himself the Son of Sam.
Son of Sam.
Hello from the gutters of NYC,...
.. which are filled with
dog manure, vomit,...
..stale wine, urine and blood.
Hello from the sewers of NYC
which swallow up these delicacies...
.. when they are washed away
by the sweeper trucks.
Screw Son of Sam. l'm not cuttin' my hair.
Hello from the cracks
in the sidewalks of New York City...
..and from the ants
that dwell in these cracks...
..and feed on the dried blood
that has settled into these cracks.
Mr Breslin, sir,...
..don't think that because
you haven't heard from me for a while...
..that l went to sleep.
No. Rather, l am still here,
like a spirit roaming the night.
''Thirsty, hungry,
seldom stopping to rest,...
..anxious to please Sam.''
l love my work.
Now the void has been filled.
He won't let me stop killing
until he gets his fill of blood.
Tell me, Jim,...

Not knowing what the future holds,...

The man must live somewhere.
So we have a man who, we suspect...
Maybe you notice he comes home late...

You know what we gotta do.
We gotta get this rat bastard.
We gotta do it.

You believe this freak?
- Do you like me?
- Ritchie, be serious with me for a minute.
- Here you go.
- l don't feel like eating right here.
- Chicken's yours, right?
- lf he stays, we ain't comin' back.
Doesn't bother you
that Ruby's been with so many guys?
That she's been shtupped
by so many guys?
What she did
before she met me is her business.
- You really feel that?
- Yeah.
lt would skeeve me a little bit, you know?
l mean, Ruby's a nice girl,
but she is a whore.
- What?
- You don't love her, do you?
What's your interpretation of love?
Commitment, responsibility,
marriage, kids.
You're not gonna marry her.
l won't let you.
You and Dionna are gonna have kids?
What took you so long, Chickie?
l'm starvin' over here. Thank you.
Can l get a...
l want a cheeseburger and l want fries...
- Sorry, we're out of cheeseburgers.

Well, can you get me a BLT?
Something like that...
- Sorry. No can do.
- What do you got, then?
- l'm fuckin' freakin' starvin' here.
- l don't have anything. We're closin'.
You got a -hour diner,
and you're closin'?
- l just saw you serve those guys.
- lt's these fuckin' guys here.
Guys, l don't want any trouble.
Just leave. Hit the bricks.
l just wanna eat.
You're not gonna serve me?
You're lucky l come into
this greasy-spoon diner.

- Who are you talking to?
- Wait, wait. Hold on.
- You talking to me?
Hold on. Chickie,

- Who?
- You don't know who this is, do you?
This is Ritchie!
- Ritchie who?

- That's Ritchie Trangali?
- He's scary-looking, but that's my boy!
Sorry, but you're gonna have to leave.
- My customers feel nauseous.
- Fuck them!
Come on, Chickie. Fuck your customers.
Relax. Get some roast beef sandwiches.

You fucking bitch!

Ritchie, easy.
You know, Ritchie,
l don't blame them, you know?
When you're in Rome...
What are you gonna do?
You come up here
with that dog collar...
We're all wearing dog collars.
You're wearin' a dog collar.
- l'm wearing a...
- You're wearing a dog collar.
You're a fuckin' dog of society. You're
on a leash to a certain way of thinking.
l don't fuckin' understand
what you're saying.
l'm not relating to this shit.
ls the fuckin' heat getting to you?
No, no. Listen.
lt's like everybody's got
two personalities, Vin.
Two personalities. One you're born with,
one the fuckin' world gives you.
Are you talking about
some alter ego shit?
Ah, no. Vin...
lt's like... l got these things l like doin'.
l like doin' 'em so much,
it's like l have to do 'em.
Now, do l really like doin' 'em,...
..or was l preprogrammed at an early age
to respond to liking them?
That's what l'm talking about.
You fuckin' lost me.
Yeah, fuckin' what else is new, man?
What the fuck? Are you saying
that if l fuckin' cheat on Dionna,...
..it's not me that made me do it,
it's the fuckin' world?
Take responsibility for yourself, man.
lt's not the fuckin' world.
lt's your fuckin' dick that made you
do that! Don't blame the world!
- My dick made me do that?
- Yeah, your dick.
The heat wave continues in the city...
..as record-breaking temperatures
claimed six lives.
Three fatalities were in Brooklyn,...
..two in the Bronx and one in Queens.
Crime has risen with the temperatures.
There is an increase
in domestic violence...
All right, you two. Out. My turn.
And Con Ed is asking that you
try to conserve electricity,...
..as several neighbourhoods
in the five boroughs...
..are experiencing brownouts.
The health department
advises the elderly...
..and people with respiratory problems...
Uh-oh.
Shit.
-
-  Daddy! Dad!
-  Take it easy, baby. Come on.
- lt's all right.
Oh, my God! Guys, this is not funny!
- lt's us. Baby, the power's out.
- The power's out?
th Precinct, Officer Hall.
Yeah, we do know. lt's a blackout.
The whole five boroughs.
- We're doing the best we can.
-
Precinct, Officer Riggs. Yes, sir.
We understand that the lights are out.
We have Con edison out in full force.
Con ed don't know nothin',
but what l know is...
..we can't expect any help from the cops.
They'll have their hands full
chasin' looters.
Niggers and spics.
lt's ourjob to protect our neighbourhood.
And this Son of Sam
has the blackout to hide in.
l want all our guys
on the Layton Avenue bridge.
lt's fuckin' my joint. Shut the fuck up.
Nobody gets in my neighbourhood
without me knowin' it.
Oh, what the fuck is this?
Pull over!
What the fuck are you doing?
Who are you? What do you want here?
No sè dònde estoy...
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- No puedo ver...
Get the fuck out of there!
Con Ed officials said...
..the lights went out at 9.pm!
l'm here at the corner
of 15th Street and 5th Avenue.
And black and Puerto Rican people...
..are going crazy.
As l overheard one man say,...
.. ''lt's like Christmas in July. ''
That's a quote.
We have reports that people
are stuck on the subways...
..and that the city that never sleeps
has come to a standstill.
l'm gonna get out of the way...
cos l fear my safety.
Joey, get the kids in the neighbourhood.
lf they need cars, you give 'em cars.
lf they need baseball bats,
you give 'em bats.
We're gonna patrol the neighbourhood.
We'll go to different points -
the beach, bridge, down to the avenue.
- Understand?
-  Yeah.
Here we go. Come on. Let's go.
We'll get you, Son of Sam!
We'll get you, Son of Sam!
And then you call Frankie.
Tell him to bring the feast lights...
..and the generators cos Luigi
is gonna give a big block party...
.. with the cannoli and the babà rum...
..and the sausage and peppers
and the spiedini.
That psycho is gonna have
no place to hide.
Frankie!
Hey, hey, hey, that's my man!
l love you, l love you, l love you!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
l got you!
Bang! Bang! l got you, Son of Sam!
- We got a fuckin' gig. You know, singin'?
- Serious?
- We're going to fuckin' CBGB's.
- At CBGB's.
Vinny, this is our first gig, man.
This is a big deal.
No, congratula...
No, l'm serious. We're excited.
Congratulations. A toast.
- l'm singing.
- They're gonna pay you. That's great.
l don't know about that.
Maybe l'll come.
How do you spell that CBGB?
C-B-G-B. You never heard of it?
lt's on the Bowery in the city.
Oh, CBGB.
You and Ritchie
seem really happy together.
Yep, we are. Just try and enjoy it
while it lasts. You know what l mean?
l guess that's a good philosophy
as long as you're not married.
Listen, um...
l know that you've been
with Vinny before.
l mean, it's not a secret or anything.
That was a long time ago.
A long time ago, before you two got
together, let alone got married, all right?
No, no, no, no. l know that. l know that.
l'm not accusing you of anything.
Then what do you want?
All l... wanted to say was that...
..since you've been with him,...
..maybe you could tell me what he likes.
- You're serious?
- Yeah.
lf l knew, l wouldn't be asking.
l mean... Look.
You think this is easy for me?
Talking to you about Vinny, you know,...
..my husband's sexual likes and dislikes.
And so you ask me, cos l should know.
No...
You guys looked happy
when you were goin' out.
And you're so sexy and confident
and everything.
Listen. l mean,...
..sometimes l-l think that, um,...
..that, you know, he's cheating on me.
Anyway, you know,
l wa... l wanna please him,...
..but l, l don't think that l do.
You have any advice? Anything?
Look, Dionna.
You are... very pretty, OK?
You're sexy.
l happen to know
that Vinny loves you very much.
l know he loves me but, um...
..l think l disappoint him.
So what do you want me to do?
Do you want me to tell you
how to fuck your husband?
Yeah, fine. l'll tell ya.
First...
..you can't be his wife.
- That's number one. Too late for that.
- Yeah.
ls this it? This where we're going?
The sign's CBGB, right? And this
is the corner of Bleecker and Bowery.
This is where my father said all the bums
were. But who are these people?
You scared?
What is this?
l can't believe Ritchie
made us come over here.
l won't even park my car here.
What the fuck is this?
Oh, my God.
Look at those girls looking at me.
- Looking at me like l'm the freak.
- Just don't pay attention to them.
Look at that thing on her tongue.
l-l don't like this place.
- l think maybe we should go.
- You think so?
You think that's right, though, huh?
Maybe we should say hello to Ritchie.
Maybe go for one drink
and then get the hell out, huh?
- Your call.
- No.
l-l-l wanna go. l skeeve this place.
- You sure?
- Yeah, l'm sorry. Let's just go.
OK. All right.
Where the hell do you want to go?
- Um...

- We're dressed for it, baby.
OK. lt's your car. lt's your night.

Death Day.
lt was one year ago today
that Son of Sam shot and killed...
..Donna Lauria
on Burke Avenue in the Bronx.
ln his latest letter to Jimmy Breslin,...
..the killer taunted police by saying...
..he would be back tonight
to mark his anniversary.
Hundreds of off-duty police officers...
..have volunteered to work
from sunset to sunrise.
Police are urging New York City
residents to stay indoors tonight...
..as the full moon almost guarantees...
..the .-Calibre Killer will strike again.
Please, be safe.
Holy shit.
No fuckin' way!
l don't fuckin' believe this shit!
Johnny boy,
you ain't goin' nowhere tonight.
- Happy anniversary.
- What the fuck did l do?
lt's what you're not gonna do.
What the fuck did l do?
Hey, man, l fought for this fuckin' country!

Oh, Father Cadilli.
You mind telling us where you're goin'?
- Do... Do l know you boys?
- Oh, you sure do, Father.
lt's been a long time. We're gonna

of the neighbourhood, Father.
You know, boys,
you really don't want to do this.
Oh, l do.
- Father, give us a blessing, will you?
- What?
Just give us a blessing, huh?
Forgive them, Father,
for they know not what they do.
Come on, Father. Something original.
l've heard that before.
Let your heart keep my commandments.
Do not let kindness and truth leave you.
All right. Thank you, Father.
Vincent, it's the middle of the night.
What's the matter with you?
Don't make everybody

Come on. Tomorrow's another day.
She'll be all right with me.
- Just tell her to come home with me.
- Tomorrow's another day. Listen to me.
July 9th, 1 977.
This is a warning to all police agencies
in the tri-state area.
For your information,...
..a satanic cult has been instructed
by their high command, Satan,...
..to systematically kill and slaughter...
..young girls
of good health and clean blood.
Executioners of the cult...
Hi.
My name...
..is Mr Williams...
..and...
..l live...
..in this hole.
l have several children
who l'm turning into killers.
Wait till they grow up...
No! Shut that dog up!

Now l need you to stay sharp.

We're close. He knows we're close.
This sick bastard,
he knows we're onto him.
- We're close. He knows we're out there.

Chickie, give me a fork.
Hey, Vinny.
You're 86'd, you and your freaky friend.
- Chickie, relax, man.
- What happened?
You didn't tell them what happened?
That freaky bastard
scared my customers.
They thought he was the Son of Sam.
- Who? Who?
- Fuckin' Ritchie.
l never seen nothin' like it,
not even in Nam.
He's fuckin' exaggeratin'.
The kid was there lookin' like
Night Of The Living Dead.
My customers get nervous
just from lookin' at him.
So l go over and l ask him very nice...
Come on! lt didn't happen like that.
Why are you fuckin' makin' it up?
- lt didn't happen like that?
- No, it fuckin' didn't!
He didn't jump up like a madman,
break a glass over his head...
..and start licking the blood
like fuckin' Bela Lugosi?
l never seen nothin' like it.
That kid scared the shit out
of everybody in the fuckin' place.
Didn't happen like... You know what?
l'll serve you guys, but not you, Vince.
- And not that fuckin' ghoul. He's 86'd.
- Like l fuckin' care. 86 me, too.
You're 86'd cos it didn't happen like that.
You're so fuckin' crazy. You're fucked up.
Vinny, Ritchie does somethin' like that
and you don't tell us?
- Come on. Are you shitting me?
- What do you mean?
You're not gonna take
that shit for serious.
What does Chickie gotta lie for?
- Anything else we should know?
- You hiding something?
- What the fuck does that mean?
- You didn't tell us about this.
What are you protecting Ritchie for?
- What else ain't you telling us?
- Don't fuckin' touch me like that!
- What's the matter with you?
- l'm goin' before something happens.
- What's wrong with you?
- Vinny, come on.
What's the matter with you?
- Hey, Vinny!
- He's protectin' him.
- This guy's out of line.
- He's protectin' Ritchie.
- That fuckin' Ritchie, man.
- He's got him brainwashed.
l'm telling you.
He must have something on him.
Vinny, come back in here!
What's up with this attitude on this kid?
Hey, leave him alone. lt ain't him.
Let's all chant...
So where do you know Ritchie from?
Don't worry. You don't have to be jealous.
l knew him long before l ever met you.
l just didn't know he did porno.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
-
You gonna play my Dead Boys?
Don't make me dance to this disco shit.
Hello, Ritchie. Mr Macho Man, tough
Bronx boy. What are you doing here?
- Shut the fuck up or l'll fuckin' kill you!

Get your hands off him!

Get your hands off him!
l'll fire your ass!
M-U...

Murder.
Welcome to another ballgame...
.. with the Yankees and the Orioles
at Yankee Stadium.
l know everybody's been complaining
about the heat, and it has been brutal.
So we've got the peftect setting...
..for a ballgame, and it's gonna be
a very exciting game, as it usually is,...
..and especially
with Scotty McGregor and Ron Guidry.
Guidry has more stuff than McGregor,...
..but McGregor gives the Yankees a hard
time when he's pitching, as he is today.
Coming to the plate, Reggie Jackson,
who's been struggling as of late.
Reggie steps into the batter's box,...
..taps the plate,
and he does look determined.
So Scotty McGregor steps off the mound,
gets back on.
Here's the pitch.
Strike one for number .
Reggie has had a lot ofproblems
with Billy Martin all year.
He's in Martin's doghouse. Martin yells
at him but Reggie doesn't look at him.
They've had their problems,
but they get over it...
Reggie steps back into the box.
Here's the pitch...
Reggie looks for the sign
from third base coach Dick Howser...
..then steps back into the box,
and number  is ready...
Help!
Reggie swings,
hits a foul ball back into the seats.
And it looks like he split that bat...
..and he's gotta walk back
and get another bat.
While he's doing that, you know
what's happening in New York lately.
Abe Beame, who was my teacher
in Richmond Hill High School,...
..the mayor of New York,
is really having his problems with the...
..the Son of Sam's murders
that are happening...
..up in the Bronx, by the way.
l want all you people to be careful when
you go out for a little spooning at night.
All right, back to the ballgame.
The Yankees have been in a slump lately.
Reggie needs one of those long balls
to get them out of it if he possibly can.
Reggie steps back into the box.
Got the new bat, don't forget.
And McGregor checks
the sign from home plate.
Here's the pitch. lnto the swing...
A long fly ball! Holy cow! That is gone!
..to tie the Orioles two apiece
in the bottom of the fifth inning.
Reggie Jackson, who gets those
clutch home runs when you need 'em,...
..sure came through that time.
Holy cow! Unbelievable!
Over to Eyewitness reporter
John Jeffries,...
.. who has been covering this story.
Son of Sam struck last night
in Brooklyn for the first time.
l'm here in the predominantly black
neighbourhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant...
..in Brooklyn, New York,
to get a darker perspective.
- Ma'am.
- Yes?
l'm just hoping that they get him quick.
l don't care.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
lt's terrible. Bad for Brooklyn,...
..bad for New York, bad for America
and bad for the world.
Thank you, sir.
- Your view.
- Let me tell you.
Son of Sam knows better than to
come into Bed-Stuy with that crap.
Cos we don't care. He's not that crazy.
l would love to beat him down right now.
He would wish he was dead. l'd just
love to catch him right here in Bed-Stuy.
Thank you.
Exactly. Hello.
My name is Cassandra Buchanan.
l live there at 85 Crown Street...
..and l am going to give you
your darker perspective.
The darker perspective is:...
..l thank God, l thank God, l thank God...
..that it is a white man
that kills all of those white people.
Because if it were a black man...
.. who kills all of those white people,...
..there would be the biggest race riot...
..right here in New York City.
And l'd like to say one thing.
l am surprised that you are
in the black community.
- l didn't think you liked black people.
-
John Jeffries here...
..in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section
of Brooklyn, New York.
Thank you, John.
He's crazy. He's crazy.
He had this look in his eyes.
He said he was gonna kill me.
You have to help me, Joey.
Don't worry, Bobby.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
- lt's a good thing you came to me.
- OK.
- Hey, Vinny, you seen Ritchie?
- Nah, not me.
He's the only guy on the list
we can't account for last night.
Where's this club, CBGB's?
Are you still with that shit? Huh?
How can you guys follow this clown?
lt's like the blind leading the blind.
Who's blind? They think for themselves.
l got my own mind.
- My head's screwed on straight.
- Yeah, exactly.
Let me tell you something. l know
Ritchie like if he was my brother, OK?
even though he was outside
the disco before the killing?
- especially.
- Where was he during all the killings?
And he fits the police profile.
He's got weird religious beliefs.
That shit he pulled at the diner don't
mean nothin'? You know him that well?
- l know him that well.
- Tell him, Bobby.
Tell him about the fag strip joint.
Who the star attraction was.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Come on!
Ritchie's a dancer at Male World.
A friend of mine works there.
He also does porno flicks.
Did you know that about your friend?
What else don't you know
about this pervert?
Doesn't make him the Son of Sam
just cos of that. Come on!
Killer, fag, pimp, punk rocker.
Queer, pervert, homo, degenerate,
whatever the fuck it is.
Who wants something like that
around here anyway?
He's your friend. Don't you wanna
know what's goin' on with him?
l do. When he calls
l'm gonna fuckin' talk to him.
You're gonna fuckin' talk to him?
You ain't thinkin' straight.
People are gettin' killed
in our neighbourhood.
Now, are you with us or not?
Hey, Vin, it's not your fault.
You didn't know. Nobody did.
Ritchie's a crazy fuck, but he's smart.
He's eluded the police
and the FBl all this time.
Listen to him, Vin.
OK, Vin, forget about us.
But what happens if Dionna's next?
How are you gonna live with that?
Knowing you could've saved her
if you acted like you had balls.
Come on, Vin.
OK... OK.
OK, all right. l'll help you guys, OK?
lt's not just you, Vinny.
He fooled the whole world.
Yeah, OK, l said all right!
Just leave me alone, OK?
Shut the fuck up.
OK, OK. You're doin' the right thing, Vin.
Sure l am. Yeah, l'm a great friend.
l'm a great fuckin' friend.
Wait a minute. ls that Vin?
- Where?
- Right there.
That's why he didn't make the gig.
He got the dates mixed up.
Give me your shades.
Watch me fuck with him.
- What you gonna do?
- Watch this. Watch.
Hey, man.
- Hey!
- You're the guy! You've seen our work.
- Get the fuck away.
- The cult's gonna get you!
- What the hell's the matter?
- Hey, man!
Oh, shit, Ritchie. You fuckin' asshole!
You almost made me
fuckin' piss on myself, you fuck!
Jesus! What did you do to your hair?
lt looks stupid.
What the fuck are you doin' here?
The gig was last week.
Ritchie, l gotta talk to you.
l gotta be serious with you.
We gotta be straight to each other, OK?
Man to man, square business, OK?
l'm serious. Fuckin' look at me when
l'm talkin' to you. Are you in a cult?
Ritchie, answer me. Are you in
a fuckin' cult? Please tell me.
What kind of cult?
What kind of answer is that?
l'm asking...
Let me tell you something, funny boy.
Joey T's in there.
He's got them all riled up
and they're lookin' for you.
They've got this list
and they're spyin' on people.
You're on the top of the fuckin' list.
Now laugh at that shit.
Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa. What list?
You can tell me, please. Friend to friend.
l'm not gonna call the cops.
Are you the Son of Sam?
They think l'm the Son of Sam? Really?
You think l'm the Son of Sam?
lt doesn't matter what l think any more
cos they're in there lookin' for you.
Doesn't matter what you think?
You thought something.
Brought 'em down here on me.
Nah, l didn't do that. l wanted things
to be cleared out and straightened out.
- All right. So?
- l just told 'em to talk to you.
Why don't you talk to me like a man,...
..one on one, man to man,
like we always have?
- Aw, fuck.
- l wanted to.
You've been acting so strange
l don't know what to do.
- Me?
- Look at yourself in the fuckin' mirror.
Huh? Look at that hair.
What the fuck is that, huh?
A hairstyle doesn't determine
whether you're a killer.
- l don't mean that.
- What do you mean?
Normal people don't dress
the way you do...
Normal people?
You think l'm the Son of Sam and you
bring a lynch mob here to string me up.
- Ritchie...
- l thought you were my friend.
- l am your fuckin' friend.
- You're not my friend.
l made a fuckin' mistake. l'm sorry.
What do l do? Bobby the fairy says
you're a nude dancer at a fag club.
What am l supposed to do with that?
- What?
- Bobby says you're a fuckin' fag dancer.
Bobby the fag don't know shit, OK?
Cos he's a homo, now l'm one?
l don't know. You tell me.
Are you suckin' dick?
ls that what you do there?
First you think l'm the fuckin' Son of Sam.
Now l'm a fuckin' homo.
l can't believe this.
You lost all faith in me?
l don't know you, Ritchie.
l don't know who you fuckin' are.
l don't know you, man.
l don't know you, you fuck.
- Fuck you!
-  Let's go, Ritchie!
- You're gonna need me, Ritchie.
- Don't do me any favours, asshole.
-  Ruby, come here!
- He's a fuckin' prick.
Ruby, could you talk to him?
- What the fuck did you do?
- Let me talk to you.
Ruby.
Go fuckin' home, Vinny!
You always start fuckin' trouble.
Motherfucker.
Those are the freakiest fuckin' people
l've ever seen in my life.
Fuckin' filthy.
l could take fuckin' ten showers,
l'd still feel dirty.
We didn't fuckin' see him, though, Joe.
Get outta the way. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Fuckin' watch where you're goin',
you fuckin' freak.
Fuck you, Guido!
- What'd you say?
- Fuck you, Guido!
All right, man, you're drunk.
So we're gonna give you
one more chance.
Who's your favourite baseball team?
Boston Red Sox.
Motherfucker.
Here he comes, Joe!
Come here, you son of a bitch!
Come here!
Boston Red Sox!
Go back to Fenway,
you Beantown cocksucker!
- Come on, let's go home.
- l ruined my fuckin' pants!
Who does this look like?
- lt looks like a young Dean Martin.
- Dean Martin.
This looks like that guy
on the Grand Concourse - Matty.
- Come on. You're not serious.
- Yeah, l'm serious.
- Reno!
- Yo.
Matty on the Grand Concourse.
Bring him here. l wanna talk to him.
l'm on my way.
Nah, it doesn't look like him.
lt doesn't look like him at all.
What do you mean,
it doesn't look like him?
Vin, if you can't see what's happening,
then you're as brainwashed as Ruby is.
- What do you mean, l'm brainwashed?
- Look what he's doin' to her.
He's fuckin' Ruby...
.. while people are there
and fuckin' filming it.
l mean, would you do that to Dionna?
Would you fuck your wife in a porn film?
Your wife, not mine.
Ruby's goin' along with it, but you don't
think he's got some spell over her?
He's turnin' her into a fuckin' porn star.
Come here.
Now you tell me...
..if that doesn't look like Ritchie.
- Holy shit! Let me see that.
- Son of Sam.
- Wake up, Vinny.
- Oh, shit!
Hey, Vinny, where the hell you been?
- Traffic was crazy. l'm sorry, baby.
- You don't call.
- You're three hours late.
- Traffic was terrible.
- Come on, sexy. Let's go.
- No, Dee, stay right where you are.
- Let her go. l gotta cut her hair.
- You'll cut her hair.
- Dee, come here. l gotta cut your hair.
- Stay where you are.
l'm sorry l'm late.
Just crazy things goin' on.
- Move, Gloria.
- What are you shovin' me for?
Who's next?
- Vinny, pull yourself together.
- See the Yankees play last night?
- Reggie Jackson, he's a god, huh?
- Vinny, get in the bathroom...
l always loved this fat fuck.
Take some Listerine. Pull yourself
together for these customers.
This is a business here. You respect it.
- l'm going through a tough time now.
- Yes, all right.
Go pull yourself together, then
we'll deal with the customers, all right?
- Dee, come here. l'm ready for you.
- He'll be with you in a minute.
Did you hear a word l just said?
- l don't feel like...
- l said pull yourself the fuck together.
Gloria, if it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have this great place.
Oh, what is that supposed to mean?
Cos l brought all these customers.
- You came here because of me.
- excuse us. l'm very sorry.
Don't fuckin' lie. lf it wasn't for me,
none of you would be here.
This place was a piece of shit
before l came here!
Hey, watch your fuckin' mouth!
- This is a business
- Here, Gloria.
Here, Gloria. Take that.
Fuck you and fuck this place!
Get the fuck out of here!
Get out of my shop!
Fuckin' shit place! Fuck you and

Forgot to lock the door, you stupid bitch.
Just talk to yourselves, OK?
Who took my fuckin' keys?
There they are.

What the fuck are you doin'?
What are you doin', baby? Oh, come on.
You're not gonna fuckin' leave me.
Come on, baby.
Come on. l'm sorry about Gloria, OK?
l'm fuckin' so sorry about that shit.
lt wasn't even fuckin' worth it.
All this time l kept my eyes closed...
..and l even made myself think
that maybe it just happened once.
- And then l gotta hear it from Gloria?
- Dionna, l quit.
l quit the fuckin' shop.
The whole thing is over.
This is a new Vinny.
Do you understand what l'm tellin' you?
How many other women did you fuck

l'm gonna see a fuckin' priest.
l'm gonna fuckin' see a psychiatrist.

- Cos l know l'm sick, baby. Fuckin' sick.
- How many!
Was one of them named Sheri?
Come on. l made that up for you, baby.
l made that up for you.
There was no fuckin' Sheri.
Don't fuckin' leave me now.
Let's work this shit out.
You and l can make this shit happen.
- Come on.
- What about Plato's Retreat?
My heart is full of love
and desire for you
OK, you're right about that.
You're right about that.
l'm sorry what l made you do there,
OK?
You're sorry about what
you made me do. What l did.
You're not sorry what you did to me.
You're not sorry that l trusted you,
and you used me.

He's fuckin'... He's in a cult.
Ritchie's in a cult.
He's brainwashed me.
l don't even know
who the fuck l am lately.
The shit l'm doing right now is not me.
l'm not responsible for it.
Oh, come on!
Come on! You're blaming Ritchie
for what you're doing?
Come on!
You know what? They fuckin' think he's
the fuckin' killer, he's the Son of Sam.
- That's what l gotta fuckin' deal with...
- Vinny, stop it!
What does that have to do
with you fucking other women?
Come on! l am not stupid!
l never said you were stupid.
l'm telling you that l love you.
You can't fuckin' leave me over this.
We're husband and wife.
We had two fuckin' great years. You can't
throw that out for this piece of shit!
- What big-mouth Gloria says to you!
- Wanna see?
l'm gonna throw it all out.
Out the window,
just like you threw it out...
..when you stuck your dick
into some other woman!
- Throw it all out! l don't give a shit!
- Fuck you!
Cos only your good lovin'
Can set me free...
Baby, look what l got for you.
Fuckin' flowers.
That's what l came here with.

l know l've been fuckin' up all this time.
And l've made some bad calls
and l'm a bad fuckin' husband.

- And you're a liar.
- Baby, l'm so fuckin' sorry.
You don't fuckin' think

Don't leave me. Don't do this shit to me.
Look, l got nothin' in this life.
All l got is you.

Cos l ain't got nothin', baby.
You're everything in my life

He treats him like a fuckin' pussy.

Police now have in custody the man
they believe is the .-Calibre Killer,...
..Son of Sam.
He was arrested outside his home
at 5 Pine Street in Yonkers.
New York City can now finally rest.
- Thank God.
- l thought he'd be from Brooklyn.
Police! Don't move! Get against the car!
Give me your hands. One at a time.
Give me your right hand. Now!
Give me your other hand.
One at a time. Slowly.
lnspector Dowd, you finally got me.
And now that l've got you,
who is it that l've got?
- You know.
- No, l don't know. You tell me.
l'm Sam.
You're Sam. Sam who?
Sam. Dave Berkowitz.
A large crowd has gathered here...
..awaiting the arrival of
Son of Sam suspect David Berkowitz.
The police have put up barricades...
..to protect the alleged .-Calibre Killer...
..from a potential lynch mob.
lt's a great outpouring of relief,...
..rage and vengeance.
Kill him! Kill him!
Ladies and gentlemen,
here he comes... Son of Sam.
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship
Will be gone
We don't know which car he's in.
Sit in judgement of all wrong
lt's pure pandemonium,...
..hysteria, chaos.
They're slowing down.
Ed, do we see him?
Yes!
There he is, ladies and gentlemen!
Smile and grin at the change all around
David Berkowitz!
lt's David Berkowitz! There he is!
The alleged .-Calibre Killer.
-
- Who is it?
He has a crazed look on his face.
Ritchie, it's me, Vinny.
Open up. Come on, open up.
What the fuck does he want?
The change it had to come
We knew it all along
- What do you want?
- How ya doin'?
The world looks just the same
lt's that hair. lt's ridiculous.
- Come on. Cut to the chase.
- Hey, Ruby.

Yep.
l'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Get him! You get him!
You get him!
Kill him! Kill him!
- l gotta talk to you.
- About what?
Dionna.
She left me.
She's gonna divorce me. lt's all over.

l don't want to go inside.
l don't want her to hear me. Come on.
Come over here.
Come on. Talk to me over here.
Please. Come on.
All right. l'll be right back.
Ritchie...
l had this big fight with Gloria, right?
So she calls Dionna and tells her
about all the women l've been with.
Dionna flips out and wants to leave me.
She wants a divorce cos l took her
to Plato's Retreat. We had two-on-ones...
l don't know what to tell you.
We're leaving tonight,
so maybe you should, too.
- You should get outta here.
- l'm doin' that.
You know something...
Run, Ritchie.
- What?
- Sorry about everything. Please run.
What are you talkin' about?
- Come on, come on!

Ritchie, eat this!
Get off me!
- You cocksucker!

You don't look so tough now!
- Come on, break 'em up!
- Ritchie!
- You're comin' with us.
- Get off of me!
- Come with us!
- We're gonna see Luigi right now.
Listen up. You ain't gettin' out

Leave him alone!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shit!
You get the fuck away from him!
Get away from him!
What the fuck is goin' on here?
What the fuck is goin' on?
We takin' the Son of Sam to Luigi!
Don't fuck with us!
He ain't the Son of Sam.
They caught him, it's all over the news.
- They got him in Yonkers, you idiot!
- You're fuckin' lying!
Oh, yeah? Tell me my Luger's full of shit.
Fuck with this, hero.
- My Luger says they caught him, OK?
- All right.
One of you call an ambulance!
Now, or l start shooting.
You, you, go and get a blanket.
lt's on the couch.
Talk to me! What happened?
Oh, my God, Ritchie!
There's nothing in the street
Just get outta here!
Get away!
Mommy!
And the slogans are replaced by and by
- Ritchie! Lay still, please!
-  Just leave him here.
You fuckin' traitor!
What the fuck are you doin'?
l'm sorry.
Did you call an ambulance?
Yeah, it's coming. lt's coming right now.
lt better be.
Of all the things,
a parking ticket did Son of Sam in.
On July 1, 1 977,
he shot his last two victims.
An eyewitness noticed a parking ticket
under his windshield as he sped away.
Of the four tickets issued in that area,
one bore the name of David Berkowitz,...
..a resident of Yonkers, New York.
At first, Berkowitz claimed insanity...
..saying a ,-year-old dog
named Harvey told him to do it.
Eventually he pled guilty.
That sick fuck is serving a sentence...
..of six consecutive terms
of 5 years to life.
The Yankees win their 1st World Series.
The New York Yankees won the
World Series against the LA Dodgers,...
..led by Reggie Jackson's dramatic
three consecutive home runs...
..in the sixth and deciding game.
Elvis Presley died.
, 7 were arrested
during the blackout,...
.. with damage going into
the hundreds of millions.
To no one's surprise,
most of the destruction...
..took place in Brooklyn,
Harlem and the South Bronx.
'77 was also one of the hottest summers
in memory in New York City.
New York, the city
that l love and hate equally.
There are eight million stories
in the Naked City...
..and this was one of them.
