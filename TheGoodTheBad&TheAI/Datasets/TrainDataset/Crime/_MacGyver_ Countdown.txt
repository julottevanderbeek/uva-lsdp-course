Right.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Take a look at what
our eye-in-the-sky has to say.
What're they
calling her?
Henry.
and we're headed
right down his throat.
I think our
passengers might object.
Not exactly
vacation weather.
Make a course adjustment
and see if we can skirt
Henry's west perimeter.
Bridge.
Right away. Patch him through.
It's the home office
for you, Captain.
Captain Howard
aboard theVictoria.
Control, over.
I'll check it
out personally.
This is theVictoria.
What is it?
Bomb threat.
Take over the bridge.
Notify Henshaw and
Neilson to meet me
at the weather fax
compartment immediately.
Yes, sir.
What was that?
MacGYVER:
Sure is great
to start off a sunny day
thinking about
the people you like most.
My pal, Susan, for instance.
She's my landlady, the
building maintenance person,
and the only human being
who's figured out
how to keep me organized. So,
how do I repay her?
A 21st century
breakfast, of course.
I wonder how
she likes her eggs.
Okay, Susan,thisis the future.
Uh-huh.
Or part of it anyway.
I think I'll hang loose
here in the past.
It might be safer.
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.
First thing we have to do
is get the fridge open.
There it goes.
SUSAN:
Okay.
That's a start.
What's next?
Now we put Roboter to work.
Isn't she great?
Let's not go
straight to "great."
After all, I did
just meet her.
Let me guess-- you
like 'em scrambled.
Just watch.
Right to the pot.
Right to the pot, Mac?
Oh.
Love that modern technology.
It needs a couple
of adjustments, I guess.
I guess.
I'm not safe in the
past here either.
Incredible timing.
Mmm.
Whoever you are, I owe
an incredible debt of...
THORNTON:
MacGyver?
...gratitude.
Good, I'll take it-- right now.
Peter?
On second thought...
Now, hold it.
Mac, I've got a job for you.
Pete, I'm on the verge
of a great discovery.
Sure, you are.
The world's just waiting
to find out
about shoe polish egg foo yung.
What was that?
It's my cranky maintenance lady
being her usual self; cranky.
Mac, I need your help.
Last time you said that to me,
I ended up in Washington wearing
a pin-stripe suit and a necktie.
Yeah, well,
that was a show-and-tell.
This is for real.
It's important.
How important?
Well, a cruise ship
in the north Pacific
with 1,100 passengers
and a bomb threat
from some clown
calling himself Viking.
How's that?
You make it kinda tough
for a guy to say no.
Team briefing
at my place. I think I'll have
at least one
pleasant surprise for you.
Get here as fast
as possible, will you?
MacGYVER:
See you then.
I had this contract
with Pete Thornton's outfit
that says I take only
those jobs I want to take.
Now, you'd think
I'd say no once in a while,
especially when Pete wants
to put me in the middle of
the ocean to baby-sit a bomb,
but, no.
Somehow he always seems
to come up
with a convincing argument,
and then he holds out
a carrot like this...
"special surprise."
Charlie!
Charlie Robinson?!
MacGyver?
Is that you?
I don't believe it.
Charlie.
Good to see you.
How you been?
Good, good, real good.
How's Shirley?
Well, lately, Mac,
Shirley's been
a little bit
under the weather.
Darned near every morning.
You're kidding.
That's terrific.
Congratulations, Pop.
Hey, thanks
a lot, Mac.
You know, we've
been trying
a long time, and it
finally happened.
That's terrific.
What're you doinghere?
Well, what is it you
always say? Um...
Too big to talk about?
You haven't been
talking to a guy
named Peter Thornton,
have you?
You got called up
for this one, too?
This is great.
This is great.
Charlie, you get back
in your car
and you go back home.
Uh-uh-uh.
This one's gonna
bail your old dad out.
You know, Uncle Sam found me in
the Computer Expert file of his
and put $25,000
on the counter.
Look, Charlie,
this isn't you
and me in 'Nam,
and there wasn't
a Shirley
or a little one
on the way back then, either.
Yeah, I know, I know,
and there wasn't a supply
company and a home mortgage
looking bankruptcy
square in the face.
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Nothing more to say.
I'm in.
Come on.
You got a screw loose,
you know that?
So? What else is new?
Suspects.
More to run down.
Any priority
you want set up?
I recruited you to do
a job on this, Mike.
It's yours, the best way
you see getting it done.
That's all I
need to hear.
Carlyle, let's get
an EPIC link-up
with Central East
and Southwest regions.
I want a profile
on these guys.
M.O.'s smoking the wires.
MacGYVER:
Doggone it, Pete.
Charlie's got
no business taking this gig.
You're Peter Thornton.
Charlie Robinson--
and ignore him.
He has this
irrepressible
paternal instinct toward me.
Mac, what is it?
You guys were in 'Nam together.
You were a bomb-
diffusing team, right?
Only the best.
Okay, coordination
and control come from here.
We've got direct communications
with theVictoria.
They've got a search going
for the bomb right now.
What's the threat
assessment?
Well, there was
a warning bomb
that wiped out
the weather room
and killed
the captain.
Come here.
There is a, uh,
storm front moving in
that makes it
impossible
to put the passengers
into lifeboats.
What about sea
or air rescue?
THORNTON:
No way.
There are no ships
or air rescue units close enough
to get to theVictoriabefore
she's into the typhoon zone.
ROBINSON:
So how do we
get there?
Take a bus?
No, you take
a jet to Midway
and a Huey chopper
the rest of the way to the ship.
Pete, given
any consideration
to tracking down
this bomber?
Oh, we're on that,
with an expert--
Mike Donahue.
No, sir, we just
can't figure it out.
Donahue? There
was a Donahue
that ran the 227 Bomb
Squad out of Da Nang.
Couple of years
before our time.
Well, that's him.
Medical discharge and back
in the Police Department.
He runs one of the best
bomb investigation units
in the country. Mike?
They've located the bomb.
Near theVictoria'sengine room.
Disguised as an
electrical cabinet,
two feet across,
three feet in height,
below the water line.
Threat assessment verified, eh?
You the guys that get
to find out how it ticks?
Oh, uh, MacGyver,
Robinson-- Mike Donahue.
Heard a lot about you.
Only the best.
Thank you.
That's what the man said
about you guys.
The question is,
how good is this Viking?
Patch from shipping
headquarters coming through.
Viking's on the line.
Put it on the P.A.
Start a trace.
:
Good morning.
This is Viking.
You will be interested
to know that I am aware
that Mr. Thornton
is listening in
from his headquarters.
In fact, I know
all about your efforts,
Mr. Thornton, and the experts
you have recruited to stop me.
Donahue. How's the leg, Donahue,
the one you lost in Vietnam?
Robinson?
Congratulations
on the upcoming baby,
and, of course, your ex-partner,
the inventive Mr. MacGyver.
Hey, Pete, nice security.
Mac, I don't want to hear it.
The bomb is set
to go off at 6:30 p.m.,
your time, ten
and one half hours from now.
The way to stop the bomb
is to put together
$6 million and deliver it.
The switching station at Proctor
puts the call
somewhere in Westwood.
Notify all field units.
Please, don't disappoint me.
Damn.
It's a five-hour flight
to Midway,
another two and a half hours
on the chopper.
That gives us about three hours
to work on the bomb
once we get there.
MAN 1:
This is Whiskey Sierra Bravo
to Midway Tower.
Requesting confirmation on a
stand-by chopper for bomb team.
MAN 2:
Midway Tower. We copy,
Whiskey Sierra Bravo.
Proceed directly to helipad
for immediate liftoff.
Ah, the tools of our old trade.
Boy, these bring back
a few memories.
Yeah, like the time you hocked
'em for a night out in Saigon.
Only the essentials, MacGyver.
And if I remember right,
you had one of your most
memorable evenings
in the French Quarter.
Oui, monsieur.
Victoria'sdead ahead.
We'll have to cable you down.
Then I'm out of here.
No telling when that
storm will roll in.
Let's start with
your bag of bomb tools.
It'll help me line up
on wind direction.
I want you to cordon
this area off
and keep the passengers
way back.
Yes, ma'am.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
Could you clear
this area, please?
Okay, boys, I've got cable
control in the cockpit.
Let her go.
MacGYVER:
Bob, we got
a winch malfunction.
I can't override, Mac.
ROBINSON:
Mac, we're going
to lose our tools.
MacGYVER:
Correction, Charlie.
They're already gone.
They've lost their cable.
They'll never make it.
They have to.
ROBINSON:
Mac, that bomb's not
waiting for anybody.
A little more
than three hours--
that's all
we have left.
Where you going, Mac?
MacGYVER:
Well, we can't
just sit up here
and look like a bunch
of dummies.
What do you say
we work out a way
to turn this cargo net
into something useful?
You mean like
a rappelling line?
Yeah, something like that.
Mac, you're a wonder,
a true wonder.
Just survival, Charlie.
Hand me that
carabiner, will you?
Listen, you can still go back
to Midway on the chopper.
And miss a ride like this?
I think not.
Hang on to that for me,
will you, Bob?
Pick a number between
one and ten. Quick.
Seven.
Close, but wrong. I go first.
Hold her steady, Bob.
We want to keep him dry.
BOB:
I'll vote for that.
Give me the count
when ready.
Hooking up.
He's on the rail.
Stand by.
Bomb's away, Charlie.
Go, Mac.
Contact Control.
Tell them they're on board.
Right.
I'm Carole Tanner, acting
captain of theVictoria.
Captain, name's MacGyver.
This is Charlie Robinson.
Captain.
The red cargo bag.
Was it important?
Well, that kind of depends
on the bomb, ma'am.
Can we get to it?
Engine room.
Follow me.
Captain, what have you
told the passengers?
As little as possible.
MacGYVER:
How long you planning on keeping
the passengers in the dark
about all this?
TANNER:
We're trying to steer
around a typhoon
which prohibits any thought
of using lifeboats.
And there's
a bomb on board.
What do you suggest I do,
Mr. MacGyver, create panic?
Well, if it was me,
I'd be awfully curious,
especially with Charlie
and me coming on board
a couple hours after
that first bomb went off.
Well, tell me, Mr. MacGyver,
would you want to know
that a very good
possibility exists
that you could die
a violent death
sometime during
the next three hours?
Yes, ma'am, I would.
That's it.
We're convinced it was placed
during dry dock last month.
It wasn't really seen until
we started looking for it.
Ooh, looks just like
it belongs here.
Yeah, until you
pull this panel off...
Don't touch that.
It's okay.
Our electrical engineer saw it
was the bomb after he opened it.
We've touched nothing else.
Do you believe this?
This guy is no amateur.
ROBINSON:
Oh, just look at those
bomb triggers, Mac.
Uh-huh.
Mechanical,
electrical,
chemical.
Get through one,
you got another.
And pray that we
take them out in
the right sequence.
Here.
The connection
to Mr. Thornton
in Los Angeles
is ready.
Pete?
Yo, Pete?
Yeah? Mac?
I can hear you.
How's it look?
Well, this one looks like
it's going to be a maze
of triggers before we get
to the real thing.
Mike, are you
hooked up to the NCIC
bomb file?
Right. Just call out the trigger
M.O.'s, we'll track 'em.
That's a good idea, Mac.
Well, I just hope it pays off.
Now this first one
I'm looking at.
we ran across
a whole bunch in 'Nam.
Yeah,
the Ling Chow bomber.
Oh boy.
Well, I know his technology.
You're looking at some kind
of chemical detonator.
Yeah, powder in a dish.
Um...
Sodium? It could be sodium?
Well, it could be,
but I don't see any source
of water to set it off.
It's sitting below a heat
sensitive thermocouple,
little blue light on it.
Boy, dishful of some kind
of powdered chemical.
Geez, it could be anything.
Well, it's a start.
Okay, guys, one list of Ling
Chow bomber types coming up.
Well, partner, who scrubs
and who assists?
Pick a number.
Uh, Captain?
Ma'am?
Hmm?
Oh, uh, yes,
Mr. Atkins.
We found another bomb.
D Deck, compartment six.
Where exactly is this D Deck?
Okay, we're here below
the waterline,
and that's D Deck,
compartment six.
Opposite ends of the ship.
Could be synched
to go off at the same time.
I'm counting down from
three hours, six minutes.
Well, partner,
looks like we both scrub.
How can I help?
Uh, just hold a steady course
and think positive thoughts.
I'll do that...
as soon as I've had
a talk with the passengers.
Well, it's just
you and me now.
Now hear this.
This is the captain speaking
with an important message
for all passengers.
The explosion that killed
Captain Howard six hours ago
was the beginning
of a grotesque threat
made upon all of us
aboard theVictoria.
That's it.
Good luck.
Mac,
can you read me?
Yeah, loud and clear.
Viking must have had
a field day in dry dock.
Is your bomb built into a phony
electrical panel like this one?
Yep. All the triggers are
behind a sealed glass cover.
I've got an exact copy
of yours up here.
This stuff around the edge...
looks like some kind
of booby trap.
Plastic explosive, maybe?
No, I'd say it's some kind
of a silicon base.
Probably a sealer of some kind.
Well, whatever.
We've got to get inside.
We're counting down fast.
Well, don't push it, Charlie.
We don't want
to rush things here.
I got a hunch that's exactly
what Viking wants us to do.
:
This is Viking.
I assume you found
the second bomb by now
and have gathered
the $6 million.
So listen closely.
You must realize that you
do not have either the time
or intelligence
to stop my bombs.
Only I can stop it,
provided you do
exactly what I tell you.
If my instructions are not
carried out precisely,
you will not hear from me again,
and you will not learn
how to disarm the bombs.
You will put the money
in a briefcase
and place it in locker number
And, gentlemen, it will be both
futile and dangerous
to try to locate me.
Carlyle?
No trace.
He knows exactly
what he's doing.
THORNTON:
MacGyver, Robinson, we've got
a dead end on the trace.
No Ling Chow suspects.
I'm gonna go ahead
with the money drop.
Do you hear that, Charlie?
ROBINSON:
Yep, but suppose Viking
doesn't live up to
his end of the bargain?
MacGYVER:
Well, what do you suggest?
ROBINSON:
I'm suggesting maybe Viking
won't tell us
how to turn this thing off.
So we can't sit around and wait.
Pick a number, Mac.
Uh, no, n-no, no, no.
We played that game already.
I guess that means
it's my turn to go first then.
You just follow in my footsteps,
partner.
All right.
But, Charlie, remember
the routine in 'Nam--
by the numbers.
Slow and easy,
and we'll live forever.
By the numbers.
Call it out, Charlie.
What's your benchmark?
All right, take it down
this way.
I'm gonna probe the gasket
that runs around the outside
of the bomb casing.
The one you think
is a silicone base.
I'm using a dental probe
from the ship's doctor.
It's a number three.
I'm sealing the entry
with petroleum jelly.
I'm penetrating the seal.
The chemical in that dish
could be any one
of a number of things.
ROBINSON:
I just need to touch it.
Get one sample to test.
Then we'll know.
If I could just reach that dish.
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there, Mac.
Hey, easy, easy, Charlie.
It's a vacuum, Mac!
It's a vacuum!
You've gotta fill...!
Charlie!
Charlie...
All right, damage control
has the area
isolated and secure.
The affected compartment
is shut tight and holding.
Now, I want lifeboats ready
and a lifeboat drill scheduled.
The passengers
will be briefed then.
Right.
Are you okay?
You know, Charlie and I
busted 51 bombs
together in Vietnam.
My God.
Charlie used to put
a little scratch
on the wall above our bunks
every time we'd get back
from doing one.
We used to tell anyone
who would listen
that we were going
for the record.
The day we shipped out,
he counted 'em.
Then he laughed, just laughed.
I'm sorry.
If we get out of this one,
it's because Charlie
figured out number 52
in the split second
before he died.
I don't understand.
He yelled "vacuum."
That whole bomb is in a vacuum.
The chemical is phosphorus,
triggered to explode
when air hits it.
The phosphorus flashed,
tripped a thermocouple,
and that was that.
But, but if the bomb
is built inside a vacuum,
then there's no way you can
take that glass face off
without air getting in.
Unless I fill that vacuum
with something else.
Like?
You got any neon signs
on board?
The search party
found another one.
In the auxiliary power room.
You got two
neon signs?
This is becoming insane.
How many more can there be?
Well, we're sure
of the two
and there's no reason to believe
they're not in sequence,
so we're gonna have
to disarm them simultaneously.
I can't be in
two places at once,
so I'm gonna need
a new partner.
Any likely candidates on board?
Me.
I'll do it.
Carole.
I mean, Captain.
The whole ship
is your responsibility.
If those bombs go off,
there'll be no ship to command.
In any case, Mr. Atkins,
you are fully competent
to handle her.
Can we get started?
Yes, ma'am.
MacGyver,
any objections?
As long as you don't mind
taking orders
instead of giving them...
Captain.
I always bow to experts.
And, um...
I think we can find
a couple of neon lights
in the lounge.
I'd say we're in pretty
good hands, Mr. Atkins.
Yes, sir.
Guess we put
the ransom money
in locker 324
and then we pull the key.
How's our Viking man
take delivery?
He probably already made himself
a duplicate.
All right, let's go.
Hey.
How about my carrying that?
Why?
I never lifted six
million bucks before.
That'd be a cheap thrill.
I'll carry it.
You keep thinking
about it... out here.
Aw, come on. Why?
Why? Donahue
has a dozen cops
covering this place.
Donahue's inside.
Yeah?
I'll be inside.
We need one of our men
out here as a backup.
And you're the lucky winner.
Com check.
Guess who?
Heads up inside, Donahue.
The money's coming in.
:
This is the last call
for interstate service
to San Francisco,
Reno and Salt Lake City.
Boarding at Gate Three.
All right, I'm going
out to the car.
I'll call in and check
on that M.O. follow-up.
Right.
Boy, there's less than
an hour to go.
Something has to give.
Yeah, I'm just afraid of
what that something is.
All right,
let's stay alert, people.
All right, Captain,
what we're gonna do here
is make a little fair exchange.
What do you say
we replace the vacuum
with a little neon gas?
But I got to admit
I was a little surprised
to see you in charge
of this whole ship.
No more than I, MacGyver.
Everything happened
kind of fast around here.
Just give me directions.
First step:
take the sharpening stone
we got out of the bar
and score a little piece of
the neon right at the very end.
Here we go.
Now, before you break the tube,
make sure you got the cork handy
to plug it
so the gas doesn't escape.
One step at a time, right?
Right.
I'm almost through.
All right, now break the tube
and plug it fast
like I just did.
Okay.
Done.
I don't believe it.
Now, we're gonna work the tube
through the sealer.
And when I pull the cork,
hopefully I'll get
a momentary suction
and that ought to give us
enough time
to get the phosphorus
out of there.
You with me, Captain?
Under the circumstances,
MacGyver,
why don't you call me Carole?
Okay, Carole.
Nice and slow.
I'll go first.
I'm working
the silicone sealer now.
The glass tube is maintaining
an air-tight penetration.
Easy.
Real easy.
Just about through.
This is the tricky part.
Okay, I'm in.
Now I can pop the cork
against the edge of the dish.
Cork's out.
Neon gas exchange
has given me the vacuum.
It's working.
It's extracting the phosphorus
from the dish.
I have an environmental exchange
in the bomb cavity.
The dish is empty.
Removing the tube.
Dumping the phosphorus.
Okay, Carole, it's your turn.
Now work the tube through
slowly.
Keep moving it forward until you
get through the silicone sealer.
I'm petrified, Mac.
Hey, come on.
Who's better than us?
You can do it.
I'm about to break through
the inner seal.
Okay, Mac, I'm through.
Good.
Now go to the dish
and pop the cork.
Got it.
I'm in the dish.
It's sucking up
the chemicals, Mac.
I think it's gonna work.
I'm gonna make it.
I know I am.
Come on, come on.
Almost there.
Okay, got it.
Well, that's one small step
for local mankind,
and still a mile to go.
That thermocouple's
German made, Boltex.
If you guys want to check it out
in the bomber file,
we'll get on to this blue
cauldron on top of the bomb.
You've got less than
an hour now.
Yeah, tell me about it.
You guys any closer
to this Viking?
Not an inch.
Stay with that.
:
Mr. Thornton, this is Viking.
Despite your efforts to ensnare
me at the bus station,
I have the money.
But you have dealt in bad faith,
so I have decided
not to give you
the bomb-disarming instructions.
Goodbye, Mr. Thornton.
That's it.
Control to field operations.
Come in.
Control, this is Carlyle.
Go ahead.
But we haven't taken
our eyes off it.
Harrison, get this place
locked down.
There's a rumor
the six million's already gone.
I'm on it.
What is it?
Thornton says that
Viking's got the money.
The money's gone.
:
He went in through here.
There's a utility room in the
back of the station, you know?
So nobody saw him, huh?
No, no, no, he had this thing
set up from square one.
Got a false back, hidden panel.
It was a nice,
neat job, huh?
There's a false
back on the locker.
Goes into the
back room.
Viking must've
had the money
two minutes after
we put it in there.
He is smart.
He's too damn smart.
Mac... I got some bad news.
Real bad.
Viking somehow outmaneuvered us
with the ransom.
He got it out of the locker
in the bus station.
We had it staked out,
but we didn't get him.
He just called...
gloating about it,
but worse than that,
he says that we broke faith
by trying to trap him,
so now he's really going
to punish us.
He's got the $6 six million,
but he's not going to tell us
how to deactivate the bombs.
He's going to let everybody
on that ship die.
So, the bottom line, Mac...
it's up to you now.
Okay, here's where we find out
just how good Viking is.
This pipework
in that blue cauldron
looked like our last trigger.
Can I tell you I haven't got
the smallest hint
of what I'm looking at here?
Well, you're doing just great.
And you're not alone.
All right now, I'm touching
the right-hand connection
at the circuit boards.
Read you.
Mac, freeze it!
What?
THORNTON:
The computer says
the Ling Chow bomber used
an unstable electrolyte
fluid trigger
on two sabotage attempts
in Cam Ranh Bay in 1973.
What does that mean?
The fluid carries a current.
Now our problem is
to neutralize it.
Donahue?
No, this doesn't
ring any bells.
:
Are you sure?
You commanded
the lead sabotage control group
in Cam Ranh Bay
'71 to '73.
Well, yeah, but
I didn't ride 'em
all personally.
This one...
All right, Mac,
hold on a second.
This could be an acid mixture.
MacGYVER:
Yeah, that's what I figured.
Breach the piping circuit,
and you release the acid.
And we'd release the acid
into this lateral wiring.
MacGYVER:
Yeah.
Probably create a short.
I understand.
All right, Carole,
I've got an idea here,
but we're going to need
some things for both of us.
Name them.
Uh, let's see, a pastry tube,
a container
of liquid oven cleaner
and a pint of milk, please.
CAROLE:
Milk?
Yeah, low fat, if you got it.
CAROLE:
Mr. Atkins?
Ma'am?
CAROLE:
You heard Mr. MacGyver.
Pastry tubes, oven cleaner,
low fat milk.
CAROLE:
Move.
On the double.
Aye, aye, Captain.
THORNTON:
MacGyver, milk?
Add a strong alkaline base
and an organic neutral...
if it's an acid,
we're in business.
What if you're wrong?
Well, then it's back
to the old drawing board.
MacGYVER:
All right, Carole,
this is the best
we have to work with.
Let's just think of it
as one giant dose
of industrial-strength antacid.
First the milk.
About three-quarters
full should do it.
You got that?
Yeah, got it.
MacGYVER:
Now I'm gonna top it off
with the oven cleaner.
You do the same.
And mix it up real good.
Okay, it's mixed.
Cap's going on.
Ready on this end, Mac.
All right, time check.
and counting.
Now I'm gonna pry up
the lead glass stopper seal
on top of the number one
cylinder, upper right quadrant.
Right.
Okay, Carole,
this is probably acid,
so just wait until I get
the stopper seals off.
There's the first one.
It's acid, all right.
I can smell it.
Now... number two.
Okay, Carole, go ahead
and remove your
number one stopper seal.
CAROLE:
Mac, is anything happening
with your acid level?
It seems to be okay.
CAROLE:
I've removed number two.
You done yet?
MacGYVER:
Just about...
got it.
All right, Carole,
I'm putting the first dose
of neutralizer into the acid
in cylinder number one.
Cylinder two.
There's a reaction starting.
All right, all four are treated.
How you doing?
Okay.
I am now removing
the final stopper seal.
Stopper seal's off.
MacGYVER:
Good job, Captain.
Now inject our milk
and oven cleaner mixture
into the acid.
Roger.
Am doing.
I have reactions.
CAROLE:
All four cylinders are cloudy.
MacGYVER:
Yeah, mine, too.
Now we wait,
keep our thumbs crossed.
Bridge, this is the captain.
I want the compartment
doors dog shut
on myself and Mr. MacGyver.
Have Engineering brace them.
If the bombs blow,
hopefully we'll
confine the explosion.
Ma'am...
Mr. Atkins,
this is no time
for conversation.
Will do, Captain.
What do you think, Donahue?
Seems like we might be
on the right track.
Well, I am impressed.
You just may have licked it.
Didn't your boys
do a post mortem
on this acid trigger in 'Nam?
Well, sure we did, but there
wasn't much left after she blew.
We ended up
with a lot of guesswork.
That's too bad.
Sure like to know if I'm right.
Well, we'll know
in about five minutes.
Hey, Pete,
don't forget, you and I have
got a little golf match
as soon as this job is over.
Yeah, right.
And I'm gonna spot you
a stroke a hole, buddy.
I'm gonna check in
with H.Q.
Keep monitoring.
Yeah, I will.
Mac? What's up?
We clear?
Yeah, we're on
a separate channel.
Come on, you never
played a round of golf
in your entire misspent life.
What's up?
Listen, I got a notion here.
Can you check out that incident
at Cam Ranh Bay in '73?
Yeah, sure I can.
What is it?
Well, this is a great piece
of booby-trap rigging,
and I mean good.
And anything this fine usually
has a personal signature to it.
It's not technology, it's art.
Art?
MacGyver, it's a damn bomb.
You just lack artistic taste.
Just cross check them for me,
will you, Pete?
Phosphorus, thermocouple,
acid trigger.
Who ran into them in 'Nam?
Yeah, it could be anybody
on a decon team.
Yeah, but who was
on each of these?
All of them.
You might be able to narrow it
down to a couple of names.
Maybe just one.
Viking.
Okay, Mac, I'm on it.
MacGyver?
Yeah?
I can see
a definite change in the fluid.
Is that what we want?
Absolutely.
It's neutralizing.
It's clear.
Okay.
MacGYVER:
Okay, everybody,
last step coming up, stand by.
I'm draining it now.
CAROLE:
Mac, everything stopped.
Okay.
We did it.
MacGyver nailed that sucker.
Congratulations.
He sure did.
Uh, listen, I gotta
notify my people.
Stay on top of this, will you?
You got it.
Mac?
What is it, Pete?
We're back on
the separate channel.
The computer ran your pattern.
Came up with one name.
Want a guess?
Try me.
Viking had to be familiar with
each of these trigger-traps.
Especially the acid...
in Cam Ranh Bay.
Is that where
Donahue lost his leg?
Yeah.
If you knew, why did you bother
with the computer check?
Well, it gave us proof.
All I had was a hunch.
Well, it nails Donahue.
Pete, back on the com line.
Right.
Carole, get the panel off now.
We have to get
to the bottom of the bomb.
It's reactivated.
CAROLE:
Okay, Mac,
I see what looks like two fuses.
Uh, yellow and blue.
Yeah, one cuts the circuit
and one fires it.
Which?
Donahue?
Right here.
I'm stuck.
I got less than a minute.
I need some help.
We've got all the pieces
of Viking's signature
right here in the bomb.
Stop it and we stop him.
Come on.
I've never made this kind
of call without Charlie.
We'd team it, two heads.
Both experts.
Help me, Donahue.
Help me and we'll stop this guy.
What's your head
and your gut say?
Yellow or blue?
Come on, Donahue.
You've been there.
You can make
a judgment call.
There are 1,100 people
aboard this ship.
Blue.
MacGYVER:
Carole, hold it.
In my tracks, Captain.
I go first. Just in case.
Pull the blue.
Thanks a lot, Donahue.
I'm pulling the yellow.
No!
Yellow, Carole,
yank it.
Viking.
Carole?
How you doing?
I think I'll live.
Me, too.
Get him out
of my sight.
Your chopper will
be here in an hour.
Do you have to go?
Well...
I can recommend the cruise.
Gourmet cuisine,
sports and games.
Dancing every night.
It's a great place
to relax,
if you've been under stress.
Well...
do I get to sit at
the captain's table?
