pirates of the caribbean,"['adventure', 'fantasy', 'horror']",JACK,L442362,"You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.",3,1

pirates of the caribbean,"['adventure', 'fantasy', 'horror']",BARBOSSA,L442157,"You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.",3,0
pirates of the caribbean,"['adventure', 'fantasy', 'horror']",JACK,L442157,"See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.",3,1

pirates of the caribbean,"['adventure', 'fantasy', 'horror']",BARBOSSA,L442360,No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.,3,0
pirates of the caribbean,"['adventure', 'fantasy', 'horror']",PINTEL,L442360,Do you believe him?,3,0
pirates of the caribbean,"['adventure', 'fantasy', 'horror']",PINTEL,L442337,I guess there is a reason to fret.,3,0

pirates of the caribbean,"['adventure', 'fantasy', 'horror']",PINTEL,L442337,No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.,3,0

pirates of the caribbean,"['adventure', 'fantasy', 'horror']",BARBOSSA,L441848,"Did you, now?",3,0
pirates of the caribbean,"['adventure', 'fantasy', 'horror']",ELIZABETH,L441848,"Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.",3,1
pirates of the caribbean,"['adventure', 'fantasy', 'horror']",BARBOSSA,L441848,My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?,3,0
