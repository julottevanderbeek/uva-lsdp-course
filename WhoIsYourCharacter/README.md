## Structure
The main report is `Report.ipynb` containing in depth explanations, results and discussions of our project. All data used in this notebook is provided in the `data` directory. The personality models are trained using the code in the `personalities` directory (which is slightly modified code from the [Modeling Personality with Attentive Networks and Contextual Embeddings](https://github.com/hjian42/automatic-personality-prediction) repository), and the trained model parameters are stored in the `models` directory.

## Requirements
All python modules used in the notebook are provided in `requirements.txt`. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary python modules.
