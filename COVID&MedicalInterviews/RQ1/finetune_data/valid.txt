Hi O
doctor O
, O
I O
am O
just O
wondering O
what O
is O
abutting O
and O
abutment O
of O
the O
nerve O
root O
means O
in O
a O 
back B-disease
issue I-disease
. O

What O
treatment O
is O
required O
for O
annular B-disease
bulging I-disease
and O
tear B-disease
? O

Sometimes O
when O
I O
have O
constipation B-disease
as O
well O
, O
I O
poop O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
blood O
. O

I O
am O
really O
scared O
that O
I O
have O
colon B-disease
cancer I-disease
. O

Other O
physical O
ailments O
that O
I O
have O
are O
, O
I O
am O
suffering O
from O
hypertension B-disease
and O
taking O
Amlopres-L O
( O
Amlodipine O
and O
Lisinopril O
) O
for O
the O
last O
10 O
years O
, O
high B-disease
cholesterol I-disease
and O
triglycerides B-disease
. O

I O
have O
multiple O
small O
cysts B-disease
in O
both O
ovaries O
( O
PCOS B-disease
) O
. O

But O
still O
, O
small O
multiple O
follicules O
have O
been O
seen O
in O
it O
with O
both O
ovaries B-disease
enlarged I-disease
. O

I O
often O
feel O
nauseated B-disease
too O
. O

I O
think O
I O
may O
have O
diverticulitis B-disease
, O
however O
, O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
common O
it O
is O
for O
my O
age O
. O

I O
also O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
a O
small O
localized O
swelling B-disease
on O
the O
LUQ O
that O
hurts O
when O
I O
press O
on O
it O
. O

To O
be O
conscious O
is O
good O
but O
to O
be O
over O
conscious O
may O
fall O
in O
the O
category O
of O
anxiety B-disease
and O
is O
not O
good O
. O

Considering O
your O
age O
and O
symptoms O
of O
constipation B-disease
and O
feeling O
something O
more O
probably O
pointing O
towards O
hemorrhoids B-disease
or O
some O
local O
pathology O
. O

3 O
) O
Avoid O 
constipation B-disease
. O

I O
am O
suffering O
from O
psychological B-disease
problems I-disease
like O
anxiety B-disease
. O

I O
am O
not O
diabetic B-disease
, O
BP O
is O
normal O
. O

Meditation O
is O
good O
for O
psychological B-disease
problems I-disease
. O

I O
have O
mild O
pain B-disease
in O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
chest O
( O
below O
the O
neck O
and O
above O
the O
breast O
) O
and O
then O
sensation B-disease
in O
the O
upper O
back O
from O
four O
days O
. O

No O
hypertension B-disease
but O
hemoglobin O
was O
10 O
and O
Vitamin O
B O
12 O
was O
below O
average O
. O

It O
is O
the O
function O
of O
your O
intestines O
that O
is O
triggered O
by O
some O
infection B-disease
and O
you O
are O
facing O
overactive B-disease
intestine I-disease
. O

More O
likely O
it O
is O
a O
functional B-disease
problem I-disease
unless O
proven O
otherwise O
. O

I O
will O
advise O
you O
to O
keep O
things O
simple O
. O

Or O
else O
, O
it O
will O
become O
very O
difficult O
to O
balance O
your O
life O
with O
the O
symptoms O
of O
hypothyroidism B-disease
. O

It O
can O
give O
a O
glow O
to O
your O
dry B-disease
skin I-disease
. O

Then O
a O
week O
later O
, O
I O
started O
to O
have O
semen B-disease
leakage I-disease
every O
day O
about O
three O
to O
four O
times O
a O
day O
. O

Let O
me O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
symptoms O
described O
by O
you O
suggest O
that O
you O
have O
a O
nightfall B-disease
problem I-disease
. O

But O
from O
March O
my O
periods O
are O
regular O
without O
taking O
medicines O
there O
is O
sometimes O
slight O
pain B-disease
in O
my O
lower O
abdomen O
and O
side O
abdomen O
. O

I O
just O
recently O
discovered O
that O
I O
have O
scoliosis B-disease
. O

I O
have O
a O
2.5-month-old O
who O
I O
recently O
noticed O
developed O
a O
tongue B-disease
tremor I-disease
. O

I O
looked O
up O
online O
for O
the O
causes O
and O
found O
them O
as O
SMA B-disease
. O

No O
significant O
pauses O
or O
periods O
of O
heart B-disease
block I-disease
noted O
. O

Constant O
feeling O
of O
missed O
beats O
coincides O
with O
frequent O
supraventricular B-disease
ectopy I-disease
. O

Very O
infrequent O
ventricular B-disease
ectopy I-disease
that O
was O
isolated O
and O 
univocal O
. O

Moderate O
aortic B-disease
regurgitation I-disease
( O
grade O
3-4 O
) O
, O
normal O
ejection O
fraction O
( O
60 O
) O
, O
LVEDV O
( O
138 O
mls O
) O
, O
no O
demonstrable O
ischemia B-disease
or O
arrhythmia B-disease
. O

She O
is O
unable O
to O
move O
her O
left O
arm O
for O
the O
past O
three O
days O
and O
also O
has O
shoulder B-disease
pain I-disease
, O
especially O
when O
not O
sitting O
. O

Does O
this O
indicate O
heart B-disease
disease I-disease
? O

Can O
a O
finger O
pulse O
oximeter O
reading O
of O
the O
affected O
arm O
be O
of O
any O
relevance O
in O
ruling O
out O
a O
cardiac B-disease
issue I-disease
? O

Please O
clarify O
, O
whether O
the O
pain B-disease
is O
prominent O
feature O
or O
inability O
to O
move O
the O
arm O
, O
or O
is O
it O
like O
that O
she O
is O
not O
able O
to O
move O
arm O
because O
of O
pain B-disease
or O
fear O
of O
pain B-disease
. O

Now O
, O
this O
is O
not O
indicative O
of O
heart B-disease
disease I-disease
. O

Left O
arm O
pain B-disease
without O
chest B-disease
pain I-disease
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
related O
to O
the O
heart O
. O

The O
possibilities O
are O
, O
one O
is O
cervical O
and O
second O
is O
shoulder B-disease
problems I-disease
like O
frozen B-disease
shoulder I-disease
, O
or O
arm O
dislocation O
, O
even O
if O
there O
is O
no O
history O
of O
obvious O
trauma B-disease
( O
frozen B-disease
shoulder I-disease
is O
more O
lifely O
) O
. O

Next O
, O
the O
pulse O
oximeter O
will O
not O
helpful O
in O
ruling O
out O
heart B-disease
disease I-disease
. O

However O
, O
if O
she O
has O
severe O
shortness B-disease
of I-disease
breath I-disease
and O
low O
oxygen O
reading O
then O
this O
may O
indicate O
heart B-disease
failure I-disease
, O
so O
indirectly O
we O
may O
infer O
. O

However O
, O
if O
the O
pain B-disease
is O
mild O
and O
weakness B-disease
is O
prominent O
then O
it O
is O
probably O
either O
cervical B-disease
issue I-disease
or O
neurological B-disease
issue I-disease
. O

Three O
months O
ago O
, O
I O
got O
viral B-disease
conjuctivitis I-disease
after O
two O
weeks O
everything O
was O
fine O
but O
eyes B-disease
got I-disease
blurred I-disease
then O
my O
doctor O
recommended O
me O
Tobramycin O
+ O
Fluorometholone O
acetate O
suspension O
and O
Tear O
Naturale O
Forte O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
no O
other O
problem O
such O
as O
redness B-disease
, O
itching B-disease
, O
etc. O
, O
just O
blurry B-disease
vision I-disease
is O
there O
. O

He O
having O
abdominal B-disease
pain I-disease
in O
the O
middle O
for O
the O
past O
four O
to O
five O
days O
. O

Pain B-disease
is O
constant O
and O
mild O
to O
moderate O
in O
intensity O
. O

He O
is O
not O
having O
any O
issue O
in O
passing O
stools O
or O
urine O
but O
sometimes O
complains O
of O
burning B-disease
sensation I-disease
while O
passing O
stools O
. O

No O
vomiting B-disease
or O
diarrhea B-disease
. O

No O
fever B-disease
. O

His O
current O
medial O
history O
includes O
diabetes B-disease
and O
hypertension B-disease
. O

He O
is O
an O 
Alzheimer B-disease
patient O
. O

Can O
you O
please O
prescribe O
some O
medication O
for O
his O
abdominal B-disease
pain I-disease
. O

I O
can O
understand O
you O
must O
be O
very O
upset O
about O
your O
father O
's O
health O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
see O
the O
abdominal B-disease
pain I-disease
in O
such O
age O
is O
often O
an O
alarming O
finding O
, O
and O
I O 
urge O
you O
to O
get O
him O
some O
investigations O
before O
giving O
any O
blanket O
cover O
of O
medicines O
. O

Common O
possibilities O
in O
his O
age O
are O
: O
1 O
. O

Mesenteric B-disease
ischemia I-disease
, O
which O
is O
the O
narrowing O
of O
the O
blood O
vessel O
supplying O
the O
blood O
to O
abdominal O 
organs O
. O

This O
can O
frequently O
occur O
in O
old O
age O
with O
diabetes B-disease
and O
hypertension B-disease
. O

The O
pain B-disease
arises O
because O
of O
lack O
of O
blood O
supply O
to O
organs O
like O
small O
bowel O
, O
large O
bowel O
, O
and O
others O
. O

The O
second O
possibility O
is O 
pain B-disease
due O
to O
any O
organ O
within O
the O
abdomen O
which O
is O
inflamed B-disease
commonly O
the O
pancreas O
( O
a O
gland O
over O
the O
back O
of O
the O
tummy O
) O
, O
and O
large O 
bowel O
. O

And O
lastly O
, O
since O
he O
has O
a O
problem O
with O
constipation B-disease
the O
gas B-disease
accumulation I-disease
can O
also O
be O
the O
reason O
of O
his O
abdominal B-disease
pain I-disease
. O

But O
remember O
, O
we O
can O
not O
say O
that O
it O
is O
because O
of O
gas B-disease
distension I-disease
unless O
we O
exclude O
all O
other O
possibilities O
which O
are O
more O
concerning O
. O

Mesenteric B-disease
ischemia I-disease
. O

Pancreatitis B-disease
, O
gall O
bladder O
or O
common O
bile O
duct B-disease
stones I-disease
. O

My O
symptoms O
are O
watery B-disease
eyes I-disease
, O
blocked B-disease
nose I-disease
, O
sneezing B-disease
, O
and O
runny B-disease
nose I-disease
with O
transparent O
fluid O
coming O
out O
of O
my O
nose O
. O

It O
gets O
worse O
when O
I O
have O
something O
from O
the O
refrigerator O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
is O
not O
common O
cold B-disease
. O

What O
other O
doctors O
diagnosed O
was O
that O
I O
have O
got O
allergic B-disease
rhinitis I-disease
. O

This O
allergy B-disease
starts O
from O
starting O
June O
to O
about O
September O
but O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
live O
with O
a O
runny B-disease
nose I-disease
and O
sneezing B-disease
. O

The O
symptoms O
you O
have O
mentioned O
are O
of O
allergic B-disease
rhinitis I-disease
. O

But O
it O
is O
just O
not O
sneezing B-disease
and O
watering B-disease
of I-disease
eyes I-disease
. O

It O
causes O
major O
complications O
in O
your O
body O
starting O
from O
sinusitis B-disease
to O
asthma B-disease
which O
becomes O
permanent O
to O
your O
life O
. O

Please O
consult O
your O
gynecologist O
for O
your O
antenatal O
checkup O
and O
investigations O
required O
to O
be O
taken O
as O
per O
your O
local O
protocols O
. O

Consult O
your O
gynecologist O
before O
any O
medications O
intake O
or O
to O
review O
the O
medications O
already O
taking O
for O
chronic B-disease
medical I-disease
conditions I-disease
. O

I O
have O
an O
oily B-disease
skin I-disease
type O
. O

Recently O
I O
am O
experiencing O
pimples B-disease
, O
white B-disease
bumps I-disease
, O
red B-disease
dots I-disease
on O
my O
cheeks O
close O
to O
my O
ears O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
feel O
very O
itchy B-disease
near O
the O
pimples B-disease
. O

I O
have O
developed O
one O
or O
two O
new O
big O
pimples B-disease
on O
my O
forehead O
also O
. O

When O
the O
pimple B-disease
subsides O
after O
a O
week O
or O
two O
it O
leaves O
a O
reddish O
brown O
mark O
on O
that O
area O
. O

I O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
wash O
my O
face O
very O
often O
as O
it O
starts O
feeling O
very O
heavy O
and O
sticky O
from O
all O
the O
oil O
on O
my O
face O
. O

I O
used O
Clear O
Gel O
for O
some O
time O
but O
it O
is O
not O
working O
on O
my O
skin O
. O

Not O
using O
any O
other O
medication O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

Kindly O
help O
me O
with O
the O
same O
. O

Use O
Ahaglow O
face O
wash O
twice O
daily O
for O
15 O
days O
. O

Are O
there O
pustules B-disease
? O

Inflammatory B-disease
red I-disease
lesions I-disease
? O

Photosensitivity O
? O

I O
have O
been O
tested O
for O
hepatitis B-disease
A O
, O
B O
, O
C O
, O
E O
, O
and O
autoimmune B-disease
hepatitis I-disease
, O
but O
the O
result O
all O
came O
out O
negative O
. O

I O
can O
imagine O
that O
you O
must O
be O
very O
concerned O
about O
your O
persistent O
elevation B-disease
of I-disease
the I-disease
liver I-disease
enzymes I-disease
. O

As O
you O
already O
have O
viral O
etiologies O
excluded O
this O
is O
time O
to O
look O
for O
other O
things O
which O
could O
lead O
to O
persistent O
elevation B-disease
of I-disease
the I-disease
liver I-disease
enzymes I-disease
. O

Notably O
the O
Wilson B-disease
, I-disease
alpha I-disease
, I-disease
antitrypsin I-disease
deficiency I-disease
, O
hemochromatosis B-disease
, O
autoimmune B-disease
hepatitis I-disease
type I-disease
II I-disease
. O

Secondly O
, O
despite O
you O
had O
a O
viral O
screening O
that O
showed O
nothing O
abnormal O
but O
there O
are O
certain O
other O
tests O
like O
Hb O
core O
total O
which O
can O
tell O
occult B-disease
or I-disease
latent I-disease
infection I-disease
and O
cause O 
of O
your O
raised B-disease
enzyme I-disease
levels I-disease
. O

Hemochromatosis B-disease
. O

Autoimmune B-disease
hepatitis I-disease
type I-disease
II I-disease
. O

Alpha B-disease
antitrypsin I-disease
deficiency I-disease
