Hello O
doctor O
, O
I O
am O
suffering O
from O
coughing B-disease
, O
throat B-disease
infection I-disease
from O
last O
week O
. O

At O
that O
time O
fever B-disease
did O
not O
persist O
and O
also O
did O
not O
felt O
any O
chest B-disease
pain I-disease
. O

Two O
days O
later O
, O
I O
consulted O
with O
a O
doctor O
. O

He O
prescribed O
Cavidur O
625 O
, O
Montek O
LC O
, O
Ambrolite O
syrup O
and O
Betaline O
gargle O
solution O
. O

Since O
then O
throat B-disease
infection I-disease
improved O
and O
frequent O
cough B-disease
also O
coming O
out O
. O

Coughing B-disease
also O
improved O
remarkably O
though O
not O
completely O
. O

From O
yesterday O
onwards O
fever B-disase
is O
occuring O
( O
maximum O
100-degree O
Celcius O
) O
. O

I O
have O
not O
come O
in O
touch O
with O
any O
foreign O
returned O
person O
nor O
went O
outside O
. O

In O
our O
state O
, O
there O
is O
no O
incidence O
of O
Covid-19 O
. O

Fever B-disease
is O
coming O
every O
12 O
hours O
. O

But O
cough B-disease
does O
not O
persist O
currently O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
a O
fever B-disease
. O

Hi O
, O
I O
can O
understand O
your O
concern O
. O

Your O
total O
count O
is O
on
the O
higher O
side O
of O 
normal O
along O 
with O
low B-disease
hemoglobin I-disease
. O

Once O
your O
fever B-disease
and O
cough B-disease
subside O
, O
start O
an O
Iron O
tablet O
for O
low O
hemoglobin O
. O

I O
have O
anxiety B-disease
and O 
depression B-disease
but O
no O
immunodeficiency B-disease
disorders I-disease
or O
chronic B-disease
diseases I-disease
. O

First O
, O
I O
wan O
na O
know O
if O
my O
immune O
system O
is O
weakened O
and O
how O
likely O
am O
I O
to O
die O
of O
Coronavirus O
. O

Second O
, O
I O
have O
itchiness B-disease
in I-disease
my I-disease
throat I-disease
and O
shortness B-disease
of I-disease
breath I-disease
. O

I O
always O
have O
it O
because O
of O
anxiety B-disease
but O
now O
it O
is O
more O
persistent O
than O
before O
. O

I O
also O
feel O
a O
very O
subtle O
feeling O
of O
pain B-disease
, O
burning B-disease
sensation I-disease
and O 
itchiness B-disease
in I-disease
my I-disease
chest I-disease
. O

I O
did O
not O
go O
out O
during O
the O
past O
ten O
days O
and O
have O
not O
been O
in O
contact O
with O
someone O
with O
positive O
Covid O
. O

Why O
am O
I O
feeling O
itchiness B-disease
and O
pain B-disease
and O
burning B-disease
sensation I-disease
? O

Anxiety B-disease
can O
manifest O
itself O
in O
physical O
or O
psychological O
symptoms O
or O
both O
. O

The O
irritation B-disease
sensation I-disease
you O
are O
experiencing O
is O
a O
part O
of O
your O
anxiety B-disease
. O

It O
has O
a O
low O
mortality O
rate O
, O
of O
2-3 O
percent O
, O
that O
too O
mortality O
is O
very O
high O
in O
people O
above O
60-70 O
years O
with O
other O
co-morbidities B-disease
. O

Please O
continue O
to O
take O
your O
medicines O
for O
anxiety B-disease
if O
you O
are O
taking O
them O
, O
if O
not O
, O
please O
consider O
visiting O
a O
psychiatrist O
and O
get O
started O
on O
some O
low O
dose O
SSRI O
type O
of O
medicines O
. O

You O
can O
also O
take O
some O
honey O
with O
water O
to O
reduce O
the O
itching B-disease
in I-disease
the I-disease
throat I-disease
and O
also O
try O
doing O
some O
gargles O
with O
lukewarm O
salt O
water O
. O

Last O
night O
I O
was O
getting O
chills B-disease
, O
feeling O
more O
cold B-disease
than O
usual O
and O
lightheaded B-disease
and O
a O
lot O
of O
burping B-disease
. O

Maybe O
like O
every O
30 O
minutes O
or O
less O
or O
so O
feel O
more O
chills B-disease
running O
down O
my O
body O
and O
chest O
feeling O
bit O
weird O
like O
I O
am O
starting O
having O
trouble B-disease
breathing I-disease
then O
goes O
back O
to O
normal O
and O
repeats O
, O
with O
weird O
feeling O
like O
chills B-disease
down O
my O
left O
and O
right O
lungs O
or O
left O 
and O
right O
upper O
chest O
. O

Also O
, O
my O
heart O
was O
pumping O
fast O
. O

Also O
, O
some O
minor O
coughs B-disease
were O
there O
since O
seven O
days O
ago O
, O
still O
here O
. O

I O
have O
white B-disease
mucus I-disease
and O
have O
not O
gotten O
yellow O
yet O
. O

I O
took O
medicines O
yesterday O
but O
today O
I O
got O
severe O
cold B-disease
and O
flu B-disease
medicine O
with O
a O
pain B-disease
reliever O
, O
the O
chills B-disease
did O
not O
go O
away O
. O

Then O
today O
, O
I
called O
the O
doctor O
on O
the O
phone O
and O
told O
him O
what O
happen O 
last O
night O
and O
the O
same O
thing O
happened O
this O
morning O
too O 
. O

I O
had O
minor O
coughs B-disease
, O
feeling O
lightheaded B-disease
, O
feel O
like O
maybe O
can B-disease
not I-disease
breathe I-disease
or O
something O
,  O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
burping B-disease
. O

I O
told O
him O
the O
burping B-disease
issue O
was O
going O
on O
for O
at O
least O
two O
years O
, O
but O
somehow O
this O
time O
I O
am O
feeling O
lightheaded B-disease
. O

He O
just O
gives O
Pepcid O
, O
a O
try O
maybe O
GERD B-disease
. O

I O
ate O
that O
today O
still O
feeling O
chills B-disease
now O
and O
still O
burping B-disease
a O
lot O
. O

Right O
now O
, O
still O
some O
chills B-disease
on O
arms O
, O
with O
breathing B-disease
issue I-disease
or O
something O
makes O
my O
chest O
feel O
weird O
and O
arm O
sometimes O
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
have O
a O
fever B-disease
now O
but O
do O
not O
feel O
hot B-disease
on I-disease
the I-disease
forehead I-disease
? O

Was O
it O
GERD B-disease
or O
flu B-disease
, O
it O
is O
Coronavirus O
or O
something O
else O
? O

I O
hope O
it O
is O
not O
Coronavirus O
. O

Any O
fever B-disease
, O
have O
you O
checked O
the O
temperatureO 
? O

Any O
cough B-disease
? O

Any O
mucus B-disease
or O
phlegm B-disease
? O

Is O
there O
any O
malaise B-disease
or O
body B-disease
aches I-disease
or O
weakness B-disease
? O

I O
have O
minor O
coughs B-disease
and O
sore B-disease
throat I-disease
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
have O
mucus B-disease
which O
seems O
white O
or O
clear O
for O
now O
. O

Hi O
, O
most O
probably O
with O
the O
history O
it O
does O
not O
appear O
like O
a O
severe O
problem O
or O
Coronavirus O
infection B-disease
. O

Is O
sore B-disease
throat I-disease
severe O
and O
does O
the O
pain B-disease
last O
the O
whole O
day O
? O

Did O
you O
talk O
to O
or O
interact O
with O
any O
known O
or O
suspected O
flu B-disease
patient O
? O

I O
woke O
up O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
had O
trouble B-disease
sleeping I-disease
being O
worried O
, O
but O
I O
got O
some O
sleep O
then O
nearby O
phone O
ringing O
woke O
me O
up O
. O

So O
far O
, O
seems O
no O
one O
got O
any O
severe O
coughs B-disease
or O
pain B-disease
so O
far O
. O

I O
only O
hear O
minor O
coughs B-disease
the O
past
week O
or O
so O
. O

Thanks O
for O
those O
medicine O
recommendations O
for O
sleep O
. O

I O
recently O
turned O
on O
the O
air O
purifier O
to O
clean O
up O
some O
air O
for O
allergies B-disease
possible O
viruses B-disease
but O
makes O
me O
cold B-disease
. O

My O
chills B-disease
right O
now O
are O
feeling O
a O
bit O
better O
, O
but O
a O
little O
sick B-disease
only O
because O
maybe O
I O
did O
not O
get O
enough O
sleep O
. O

No O
severe O
reports O
near O
my O
district O
, O
and O
have O
not O
heard O
anyone O
in O
serious O
condition O
. O

So O
, O
last O
week O
I O
have O
a O
sore B-disease
throat I-disease
and O
tonsil B-disease
pain I-disease
while O
swallowing O
for O
a O
few O
days O
, O
then O
one O
day O
drank O
a O
lot O
of O
honey O
and O
water O
and O
some O
tea O
, O
then O
it O
got O
better O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
it O
got O
smaller O
, O
but O
the O
pain B-disease
was O
less O
now O
though O
. O

Between O
my O
tonsils O
in O
the O
middle O
( O
behind O
the O
tongue O
) O
looks O
like O
my O
throat O
, O
got O
some O
red O
stuff O
, O
maybe O
looks O
like O
inflamed B-disease
or O
rashes B-disease
. O

But O
yours O
has O
picked O
up O
the O
two O
big O
bumps O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
throat O
( O
enlarged B-disease
tonsils I-disease
) O
. O

The O
tonsils O
could O
be O
enlarged O
due O
to O
the O
current O
infection B-disease
and O
sore B-disease
throat I-disease
problem O
you O
are O
having O
. O

The O
pharyngeal O
wall O
between O
the O
tonsils O
could O
be O
having O
some O
granular B-disease
bumps I-disease
which O
are O
quite O
common O
during O
an O
infection B-disease
. O

Now O
you O
do O
not O
worry O
, O
for O
most O
such O
infections B-disease
are O
due O
to O
viruses B-disease
( O
not O
Corona O
) O
. O

Tylenol O
every O
time O
you O
got O
pain B-disease
will O
help O
you O
tide O
over O
this O
period O
wonderfully O
. O

Now O
watch O
for O
some O
warning O
symptoms O
fever B-disease
, O
increased O
pain B-disease
, 0
thick 0
mucus B-disease
, O
thick O
postnasal B-disease
drip I-disease
, O
severe O
malaise B-disease
, O
swelling B-disease
in I-disease
the I-disease
neck I-disease
, O
etc O
. O

the O

Pepcid O
again O

for O
the O

I O
