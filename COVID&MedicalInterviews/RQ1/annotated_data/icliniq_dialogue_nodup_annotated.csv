Why my ortho does not put brackets in power chains while missing one or two spots?,

Premature atrial contractions or supraventricular ectopics are not harmful per se other than giving you symptoms.,"atrial contractions, supraventricular ectopics"
"So antiarrhythmics are not usually recommended, so I do not disagree with your treating cardiologist.",
"Beta blocker is the safest option available, although not the most effective one and other options are ablation or antiarrhrythmics.",
So trying behavioral techniques is a good option.,
"But if it troubles you a lot then you may request low dose antiarrhythmics like Amiodarone for a short period of time, but they may again come back after the drug is stopped.",
"Since there is no atrial fibrillation or SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), antiarrhythmics are absolutely necessary, but the benefit would be in you is just symptomatic, which comes with the risk of side effects.","atrial fibrillation, svt (supraventricular tachycardia"
"However, you should have Holter at regular intervals like yearly (with echo for aortic regurgitation), or if you notice sustained ectopics or irregular rhythm implying development of fibrillation.","aortic regurgitation, ectopics, irregular, rhythm, fibrillation  "
You may discuss changing Atenolol to others like Metoprolol and see if its help.,
"You should try to identify triggers like sleep or gastric disturbances, alcohol or smoking (if any), any particular medications (which you are on), stress, etc.","sleep or gastric disturbances, stress"

What about ECG reading?,

"Please clarify, whether the pain is prominent feature or inability to move the arm, or is it like that she is not able to move arm because of pain or fear of pain.",pain

Left arm pain without chest pain is unlikely to be related to the heart.,"arm pain, chest pain"
"Also, there would not be any difficulty in moving the arm with a heart attack.",heart attack
So it is unlikely to be related to the heart.,
"The possibilities are, one is cervical and second is shoulder problems like frozen shoulder, or arm dislocation, even if there is no history of obvious trauma (frozen shoulder is more lifely).","shoulder problems, frozen shoulder, arm dislocation, trauma"

"However, if she has severe shortness of breath and low oxygen reading then this may indicate heart failure, so indirectly we may infer.","shortness of breath, heart failure"
"However, if the pain is mild and weakness is prominent then it is probably either cervical issue or neurological issue.","pain, cervical issue, neurological issue"
So get her examined by local doctor and x-ray done.,

I am so afraid all of this might have had an impact on the baby.,
Is there a risk my baby might have been affected?,
"As you have not mentioned the date of your last menstrual period, I am assuming by day 0 you mean the starting date of last menstrual cycle.",
Because we calculate the pregnancy age from that date.,
"So yes, the early pregnancy time is very important because the embryo is developing in that time period.",
"So as per your query, as you mentioned the consumption of wine in the early three weeks, I do not think it is gonna have any effect on the embryo because it is in the preovulatory phase when even the egg is being formed and released.",
"And yes, corticosteroid in high doses when used for chronic medical conditions can have a risk of cleft lip and palate, but a single shot taken for an allergic reaction should not be affecting the baby.",allergic reaction
"Also, the Flucloxacillin is a penicillin group of drug which is usually safe in pregnancy.",
So be calm and stop worrying about the risks.,
It will just increase your stress levels.,
"Moreover in early pregnancy, if any embryo is grossly affected by any insult, it either usually aborts early if the exposure has been hazardous, but if the exposure is nonhazardous, it makes through and the baby will be fine.",insult
This is called all or none phenomenon in pregnancy.,
"So your exposure to the medications was not that is something very dangerous, so rest assured.",
"And more over your pregnancy has reached until 6 weeks, that is a good sign that the embryo has not been affected by the exposure to the drugs you have been worrying about.",

"Hi doctor, I am 23 years old.",
It has been more than a year my liver function test result remains high.,
"I have been tested for hepatitis A, B, C, E, and autoimmune hepatitis, but the result all came out negative.","hepatitis a, autoimmune hepatitis"
My doctor told to take blood test regularly.,
"But, it has been almost a year now, the result still remains high.",
The lowest result so far I get is AST 90.,
"But my latest liver function test result shows my AST, ALP, and GGT all 200+.",
May I get any advice on this?,
"I did not take any medication, consume any alcohol, but the result still came out high.",
I am so worried about that.,
I can imagine that you must be very concerned about your persistent elevation of the liver enzymes.,
As you already have viral etiologies excluded this is time to look for other things which could lead to persistent elevation of the liver enzymes.,
"Notably the Wilson, alpha, antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis type II.","alpha antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis type ii"
"I want you to upload all your previous investigations, ultrasound reports if done, and any other testing that you have been performed in the past two years.",
I also suggest you to get following blood tests which would help us excluding the above possibilities.,
It is possible that you have some testing already and I do not want that you should repeat it but do upload the reports as I can see those.,
"Secondly, despite you had a viral screening that showed nothing abnormal but there are certain other tests like Hb core total which can tell occult or latent infection and cause of your raised enzyme levels.",infection
"Since the investigation may cause you significant cost it is possible alternative that you can discuss with me in detail, as we can shrink some of those testings by closely inquiring about those causes in history before getting tested.",
I am sure we would reach a conclusive diagnosis by relevant information you provide and after investigations.,
