# Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging time for all of us. The rapid spread and the deadliness of the virus have led to great social and economic disruption: lockdown in multiple countries, a global recession, and the closing of public areas. Healthcare workers run overtime to manage the shortage of hospital beds and treatment of the COVID-19 virus, while not much is known about it. AI models, specialized in NLP tasks, could help process COVID-19 information in medical interviews and make it more interpretable and visible. This could be of help in getting to know the virus and advising patients what to do. This project will focus on the influence of COVID-19 in medical interviews. Three different topics, research questions, and models will be discussed to answer the question: how has COVID-19 influenced medical interviews?

# Structure
This repository is structured as follows: 
- It includes a notebook where it is explained how the research is conducted, along with the code and the results. 
- It includes a folder for all research questions 'RQ1', 'RQ2', 'RQ3'. In these folders you can find annotated data, pre-trained models and other useful data to aid a specific research question.
  - RQ1: This folder contains annotated data that is used in the evaluation and training, a pre-trained model and pre-saved results (graphs/plots).
  - RQ2: This folder includes emotion scores, a pre-trained model and pre-processed data. 
  - RQ3: This folder includes annotated data, a pre-trained model and pre-saved results (graphs/plots). 
- It includes utils for all three research questions. In these utils you can find the code and functions that are used to answer the different research questions.
