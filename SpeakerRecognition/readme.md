## Introduction
*Speaker Recognition* is a biometric task that allows an automated system to identify a speaker by creating a model of the features of a speaker's utterances. Speaker recognition is applicable to the domains of security (speaker verification), information retrieval (speaker identification) and has common applications in today's smart devices or voice activated services.

This project's goal is to evaluate speaker recognition using Keras.  Additionally the x-vector method is explored.
