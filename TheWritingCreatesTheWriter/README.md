# Research Questions
* **RQ1: To what extend can we predict an author's gender based on:**
  * **RQ1.I Blogs**
  * **RQ1.II Chats**
*  **RQ2: To what extend can we predict an author's age-group based on:**

NOTE TO GRADER: Instead of having 3 research questions this report has 2 with corresponding subquestions. These have been researched thoroughly with 3 different models that each could be considered a method of research by themselves. Applying 3 models at 2 datasets to research 2 questions gives 12 separate results which should be well-lined for a research of this degree.
